It showed a group of men, with orange scarves draped around their necks, heckling a woman in Moradabad town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. \"It's because of people like you that this law had to be enacted,\" one of the men scolds her. The hecklers were from Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group which supports Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The law they are talking about is the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance that the state recently brought in to target \"love jihad\" - an Islamophobic term radical Hindu groups use to imply that Muslim men prey on Hindu women to convert them to Islam through marriage. The incident in the video took place on 5 December. The Bajrang Dal activists handed over the 22-year-old woman, her husband and his brother to the police, who then sent her to a government shelter and arrested the men. Days later, the woman, who was seven weeks pregnant, alleged she suffered a miscarriage while in custody. Earlier this week, a court allowed her to return to her husband's home after she told the magistrate that she was an adult and had married the Muslim man by choice. Her husband and brother-in-law remain in jail. In media interviews since being released on Monday evening, she has accused the staff at the shelter of mistreating her and said that her initial complaints of stomach pain were ignored. The shelter has denied the allegations. \"When my condition deteriorated, they took me to a hospital [on 11 December]. After a blood test, I was admitted and they gave me injections, after which I started bleeding.\" Two days later, she said, she was given more injections. The bleeding increased and her health worsened, leading to the loss of her baby, she says. Whether that is true and what exactly happened in the hospital is still unclear. On Monday morning, while she was still in detention, the authorities rubbished reports that she had miscarried. The reports were based on interviews with her mother-in-law. The chairperson of the Child Protection Commission, Vishesh Gupta, denied all reports of the miscarriage and went as far as to insist that \"the baby is safe\". A gynaecologist at the hospital where she was treated told reporters that \"the seven-week-old foetus could be seen in the ultrasound\". However, the doctor added only \"a trans-vaginal test could confirm whether the baby was safe or not\". But the authorities have not yet commented on the allegations she has made since her release. They have also not given her the results of her ultrasound examinations or details of which medicines she was injected with. So, five days after she was first taken to hospital, there's still no clarity on the status of the baby, raising questions and doubts. But reports that the young woman may have had a miscarriage have caused outrage in India, with many taking to social media to blame the authorities for it. In India, interfaith marriages have long attracted censure, with families often opposing such unions. But the new law, which stipulates that anyone wishing to convert must seek approval from the district authorities, gives the state a direct power over the citizens' right to love and choose a spouse. It carries a jail term of up to 10 years and offences under it are non-bailable. At least four other BJP-governed states are drafting similar laws against \"love jihad\". Critics have called the law regressive and offensive and said it would be used as a tool to target interfaith couples, especially liaisons between Hindu women and Muslim men. A petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court, demanding that it be scrapped. In the short time since it was passed on 29 November, at least half a dozen cases have been reported under the controversial law. Weddings of interfaith couples, between consenting adults and even those involving parental approval, have been halted and Muslim grooms have been arrested. The 22-year-old woman says she had converted to Islam and married her Muslim husband in July in Dehradun, a city in the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand. They were intercepted when they came to Moradabad to register their wedding. \"The biggest problem with a law like this is that it treats interfaith love as a criminal activity,\" says historian Charu Gupta. \"It also refuses to believe that a woman has agency, it disregards her free will. Isn't it a woman's choice who she wants to marry? And even if she wants to convert to another religion, what is the problem? \"This law,\" she says, \"is so wide in its range and scope, and it puts the onus on those charged under it to prove their innocence. And that is very dangerous.\"", "summary": "Des informations selon lesquelles une femme hindoue enceinte qui a été séparée de force de son mari musulman et qui a peut-être ensuite fait une fausse couche a mis en lumière les controverses concernant une nouvelle loi anti-conversion en Inde."}

The \"survivors' issue\" has angered some Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. A video purportedly from al-Qaeda in Yemen said it planned the Hebdo attack. US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said they believed the video was authentic but could not determine if its claims were true. The group, AQAP, had previously welcomed the attack, without acknowledging any role in the operation. The gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the Prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine. Charlie Hebdo's latest cover shows a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad weeping while holding a sign saying \"I am Charlie\", and below the headline \"All is forgiven\". \"I am Charlie\" emerged as a message of support for the magazine following the attack on 7 January, which left eight journalists, including its editor, dead in addition to four others. In a separate attack in Paris two days later, an Islamist gunman killed four Jewish men and took hostages at a kosher shop. The same attacker is believed to have shot a policewoman the day before. 'Charlie is alive' Normally Charlie Hebdo prints 60,000 copies but the planned run increased steadily this week - from one million to three million to five million. The \"survivors' issue\", as the magazine calls it, is available in six languages including English, Arabic and Turkish. Proceeds are going to victims' families. President Francois Hollande has insisted the magazine and its values will continue. \"Charlie Hebdo is alive and will live on,\" he said. \"You can assassinate men and women but you will never kill their ideas.\" Charlie Hebdo's decision to publish another cartoon of the Prophet drew threats from militant Islamist websites and criticism from the Islamic world. The Islamic State (IS) militant group said it was \"an extremely stupid act\". Meanwhile, a new video apparently from AQAP said the group had planned and financed the Charlie Hebdo attacks in \"vengeance for the Prophet\". It said it was a \"success\" that the magazine shootings had \"coincided\" with the attacks by supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The video purporting to come from AQAP does appear to be genuine but questions remain over just how closely AQAP was really involved in last week's Paris attacks. More than two years have elapsed since Said Kouachi, one of the three gunmen, is believed to have slipped out of Yemen after spending time there with al-Qaeda members, including the extremist preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki. He is mentioned in the video in connection with the attack planning but Al-Awlaki was killed back in 2011 in a US drone strike so, again, that would be a long time to plan such a relatively simple but devastating attack. It is also odd that AQAP have not issued any so-called \"martyrdom videos\", showing the perpetrators giving their justifications ahead of the raid. These may still be to come but for now it seems the connection between the Paris attackers and AQAP is more one of inspiration, ideology and training rather than close direction and leadership. Were gunmen aided by terror network? Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to IS in a video message while the Charlie Hebdo attackers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had said they were acting on behalf of AQAP. Coulibaly had said they had co-ordinated the attacks but experts say it is highly unlikely IS and AQAP, rivals in the Middle East, would work together. Meanwhile a lawyer for Said Kouachi's wife, Soumya, has told the BBC she had no idea he was an extremist. He said Kouachi had kissed his wife goodbye and told her he was visiting his brother, because he was unwell, just hours before the Charlie Hebdo attack. \"It's beyond her understanding, her world has fallen apart,\" the lawyer, Antoine Flasaquier, said. Ban on distribution The magazine's release comes after millions - including dozens of world leaders - took part in a unity rally in Paris on Sunday. Outside France, the Washington Post, Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine, Corriere della Sera in Italy and the UK's Guardian are among publications that have shown the latest cartoon. The BBC has published the image in a previous story and in a statement said: \"We have made the editorial judgment that the images are central to reporting the story.\" Why people are buying the magazine Catherine Boniface, Paris: \"This issue is symbolic, it represents their persistence, they didn't yield in the face of terror.\" Read more: In the queue for Charlie Hebdo Read more: Charlie Hebdo's place in French journalism Read more: The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad Meanwhile, the interior minister of Senegal - whose president took part in the Paris march - has issued an order banning the distribution of the magazine, according to the national news agency. Comedian arrested Several hundred people attended the funeral on Wednesday of Michel Renaud, who was killed while visiting Charlie Hebdo's offices. Ceremonies were held for seven other victims in France and Israel on Tuesday. Meanwhile, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been arrested for \"defending terrorism\" after he likened himself to gunman Amedy Coulibaly. A judicial source quoted by AFP news agency said he was due to be released on Wednesday evening but would face trial at a later date.

NBC News said officers had been responding to a \"medical welfare call\" and the decision to hospitalise West was for his own health and safety, citing \"multiple authorities familiar with the case\". Gossip website TMZ said that West was taken to hospital for \"psychiatric evaluation\" and had been seeking treatment for \"severe sleep deprivation\". The Los Angeles Times reported that there had been a 911 call from the address, citing a fire department source.

He criticised Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg for failing to give him $53m (£42.5m) to get out of debt and said he was hurt that Jay Z failed to visit his family after last month's robbery. West then appeared to suggest that Jay Z employed hit men, saying: \"Jay Z, I know you got killers, please don't send them at my head.\" \"Get ready to have a field day, press, because the show's over,\" he said, as he dropped his microphone and walked out.

The mother-of-two - who became a household name thanks to the reality series Keeping up with the Kardashians - has now left France, flying out of a Paris airport aboard a private jet. A police source has told the BBC the attack was carried out by five men, wearing police-style jackets, who forced the building's overnight security guard to show them where Kardashian West was staying. Once inside, one of the men put a gun to her head while they robbed her of jewellery including a ring worth €4m, then tied her up and locked her in a bathroom while they escaped.

They needed their children's assistance to type and send text messages or log in to their accounts and read emails. And their frequent excuse for missed calls was: \"My phone was in my handbag.\" These days, the jokes have upgraded to Nigerian mothers and their infatuation with WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in Africa. Nigerian comedians like Maraji have been making skits about them. \"My mother spends her entire morning on WhatsApp,\" 39-year-old Udo, whose home is in Lagos, told me. \"Throughout while she's having her breakfast and drinking her tea, she's checking people's status updates and watching videos.\" 'Relevant messages' Unlike Twitter and Instagram, WhatsApp can work even when internet connections are iffy, as is often the case in many parts of Nigeria. And it requires no profiles or passwords, so the generation that mostly retired from active life before access to the internet became common in Nigeria finds it easy to use. In fact, it is their internet. A common complaint among younger Nigerians is the number and nature of WhatsApp messages they receive from their mothers. \"You just wake up in the morning and you see 10 videos from your mother,\" 41-year-old Ihuoma, who lives in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, told me. \"And each one begins with: 'You must watch this!' 'This will help somebody!' Those are always the opening lines.\" Her 76-year-old mother, Patty, told me that all the messages she forwards are \"relevant\". \"I don't send frivolous messages at all,\" she said. \"Why I send those things to my children, it is a form of education, lifting up of minds, sharing knowledge, experiences. I consider it a sort of fellowship, sharing with my children.\" Ihuoma has since muted her mother's WhatsApp account and rarely opens her messages. For many Nigerian mothers, the ability to broadcast ready-made messages via WhatsApp is like a superpower. It enables them to transmit unsolicited prayers, advice and opinions. One woman who complained on Twitter about her mother putting onions in the corner of every room in the house - touted on WhatsApp as a way to absorb toxins - received replies saying their mothers had also followed the erroneous advice. \"In our family group, my mother was always forwarding me and my siblings different health suggestions, concoctions to mix and drink,\" said Udo. \"When I pointed out to her that some of them are questionable, she replied: 'You never know, just try it and see.'\" Her mother also forwarded gory videos of kidnap victims and crime scenes, insisting that her children needed to see these to be aware and beware. \"That's when I left the family group and felt I could not do this any more,\" Udo said. \"My brother blocked her, which hurt her a lot. But she wouldn't listen. She keeps forwarding.\" Thongs, cancer and other fanciful warnings A number of people told me that they also had blocked their mothers on WhatsApp but did not want to let them know. \"I was once involved in an online debate about this,\" Ihuoma said. \"Some people were of the opinion that they wanted to block their mothers but couldn't get themselves to do that to someone who had carried them in the womb for nine months.\" They were tired of the advice and cautions, mostly from conservative or religious mothers who have always had a problem with their more liberal-minded children's lifestyles. Warnings, for example, signed by unknown medical experts, explaining how wearing thongs can cause cancer and how tight skirts can lead to heart attacks. And of the most implausible stories: All stories accompanied by videos and photos. Affordable internet access became common in Nigeria just a few years ago, so this generation of elderly Nigerians was hardly exposed to the wonders of Photoshop and the ingenuity of idle minds that invent stories just for fun and clicks. The Wuhan 'dragon' And so, they tend to believe most information they come across, especially when there is visual \"evidence\". \"My mother sent me and my siblings a video of a dragon-like creature fleeing towards the sky,\" said 40-year-old Grace, who lives in Lagos. \"She said we should see, that coronavirus was finally leaving the earth.\" More about fake news: Grace was shocked that her well-educated, 76-year-old mother could actually believe that the coronavirus was captured on camera, finally fleeing the Chinese city of Wuhan through the clouds and into the sky. \"She asked me how I knew that it wasn't true and I said: 'Mummy, the coronavirus is not a flying reptile!' \"She acknowledged that I was right and we just kind of laughed over it.\" Hardly any of the ongoing efforts here to combat fake news and improve digital literacy focus on older Nigerians - and so the burden must continue to rest on younger family members like Grace to correct and enlighten their parents. But, sometimes, even this is impossible. \"Sometimes when I correct her, my mother tells me that I'm being rude,\" said Udo. \"She complains that I'm being insulting.\" More Letters from Africa: Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "summary": "Dans notre série de lettres d'écrivains africains, la romancière nigériane Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani affirme que les enfants doivent désormais surveiller leurs parents crédules sur WhatsApp."}

Counter terrorism officers are continuing to question local man Khairi Saadallah, 25. What happened? Police were called to Forbury Gardens at about 19:00 BST on Saturday following reports that a number of people had been stabbed. Thames Valley Police said a suspect was apprehended and arrested within five minutes of the call. That man is now known to be Mr Saadallah, who remains in custody. He was initially arrested on suspicion of murder, and was later re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Home Secretary Priti Patel praised the officers who arrested him. \"These officers - a few of whom were student officers - ran towards danger to help those in need without second thought,\" she told MPs. \"A young, unarmed police officer took down the suspect without hesitation, while another performed emergency first aid to those who were injured.\" Security guard Sydney McDonald, 65, who witnessed the arrest, said officers \"rugby-tackled\" the man to the floor at approximately 19:10. The head of counter terrorism policing, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the attack was unrelated to a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest held hours earlier in the park, and that members of the public had provided emergency first aid to victims in the immediate aftermath. Three people suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital. They have since been discharged. About a dozen armed police officers with shields were seen entering a block of flats in Basingstoke Road in Reading at about 23:00 BST, and families living in the building were moved out. A loud bang was heard from the flats at about 00:30 BST, as officers gained entry to an apartment. What do we know about the victims? Tributes have been paid to the three people who died - teacher James Furlong, American Joe Ritchie-Bennett and scientist David Wails. Mr Furlong, 36, was head of history and government and politics at the Holt School in Wokingham. His parents, Gary and Janet, described their son as a \"wonderful man\" who will \"live in our hearts forever\". The Holt School said Mr Furlong was a \"kind and gentle man\" with a \"real sense of duty\" who \"truly inspired everyone he taught\". On Monday, Joe Ritchie-Bennett was also named by US TV network CBS as having died. The 39-year-old was originally from Philadelphia and had lived in the UK for 15 years, according to reports. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, Mr Ritchie-Bennett initially worked for a law firm in London after moving to the UK. About 10 years ago he joined a Dutch pharmaceutical company which has its headquarters in Reading. His father, Robert Ritchie, said: \"The family is heartbroken. They have lost their brilliant and loving son. This was senseless.\" His brother, also named Robert, told US newspaper the Philadelphia Inquirer that Mr Ritchie-Bennett was a \"great guy\" who \"did not deserve to go out like this\". The chief executive of the LGBT+ charity Reading Pride, Martin Cooper, who knew both men, said their deaths were \"a tragedy to so many people\" and that they would be \"sorely missed\". \"They should be remembered as extremely friendly gentleman who were always fun, engaging and a pleasure to be around,\" he added. The third man has been named as 49-year-old scientist David Wails. Michael Main, who knew all three victims, said he had \"a lot of banter\" with Mr Wails as regulars at The Blagrave Arms pub in Reading town centre. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he recalled Mr Wail's \"dry sense of humour\" and how \"he would do anything for anyone that he could\". What do we know about the suspect? Mr Saadallah, a 25-year-old Reading man, came to the UK from Libya in 2012. He originally claimed asylum and was given leave to remain in 2018, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said. A close member of his family told the BBC that he left Libya to escape the violence there, and that he had suffered from post-traumatic stress from the civil war. However, he had been thinking of trying to return. They said his long-standing mental health problems had been exacerbated by the coronavirus lockdown. He came to the attention of MI5 last year as someone who might travel overseas, possibly for terrorism purposes, but they assessed that he was not a genuine threat or an immediate risk. No case file was opened which would have made him a target for further investigation. There are about 3,000 people under investigation by MI5 over extremist activity, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. Mr Saadallah was among a further 40,000 names in the agency's system but who were not under active investigation, Corera said. A friend of the suspect told Sandford that Mr Saadallah seemed to be a \"normal, genuine guy\", and had been someone with whom to smoke cannabis. Kieran Vernon said: \"He seemed like me or you. Whenever we used to meet up we used to talk about drinking whiskey and how different ganja (cannabis) affects the different thinking of mind. And that's pretty much all we'd chat about.\" Neighbours said Mr Saadallah threw a TV from his top-floor flat this year and had a mental health key worker. Officers are not looking for any other people in connection with this incident and say there is no intelligence to suggest that there is any further danger to the public. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said that the \"motivation for this horrific act is far from certain\". What did witnesses see? The park, located in the Reading town centre, was reportedly busy at the time of the attack, and officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen something to contact police. Witness Laurence Wort, 20, told the BBC that he was visiting Reading for the day and was about 10m from the attack. \"The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went round a large group trying to stab them,\" he said. \"He stabbed three of them and then turned and started running towards me, when we turned and started running. \"When he realised that he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down. \"He got one in the back of the neck and then when he realised everyone was starting to run, he ran out the park.\" What has the reaction been? Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially tweeted to say that his \"thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading\". In a later interview on Sunday, the PM said: \"If there are lessons that we need to learn about how we handle such cases, how we handle the events leading up to such cases, then we will learn those lessons - and we will not hesitate to take action when necessary.\" Asked what action he was suggesting, he replied: \"If there are changes that need to be made to our legal system to stop such events happening again, we will not hesitate to take that action - as we have before, you will recall, over the automatic early release of terrorist offenders.\" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said communities across the UK were \"united in their grief\" and that he wanted to work with the government to see what lessons could be learnt, adding \"this is not a time for party politics\". On a visit to the crime scene on Monday, the home secretary said investigators were carrying out \"extensive work\" into the attack. Ms Patel added that officers must \"look at all aspects\" of Mr Saadallah's history, which she said \"dates back over several years\". Speaking in the Commons later, the minister said the terrorism threat facing the UK was \"complex, diverse and rapidly changing\" - and that the threat posed by lone attackers was \"growing\". Reading Borough Council leader Jason Brock said the town was \"an incredibly strong community\" where \"people will come together and they won't allow themselves to be divided\".", "summary": "Trois personnes sont mortes et au moins trois autres blessées après avoir été poignardées dans un parc à Reading."}

But the family still has some way to go before it achieves the status enjoyed by eight-year-old Ryan Kaji, whose Ryan's World channel has more than 24 million subscribers. His rank as YouTube's top earner has translated into a $200m line of toys and a series on Nickelodeon. \"That kid makes $25m a year. Why wouldn't you want to be there?\" Mr Camarillo says. \"I think that's the goal.\" The desire to branch out comes at a critical moment. Toymakers, faced with an industry-wide slump in sales, are increasingly deepening their relationships with YouTube creators, offering sponsored videos and licensing deals in response to their power to draw audiences and drive sales. Meanwhile, YouTubers are grappling with a plunge in income from ads, after the platform overhauled its advertising policies for children's channels to comply with regulatory concerns about privacy. Rule change For the Camarillos, the changes - which include limits on targeted ads and an end to comments - meant an instant drop in ad revenue of about 50%. \"We prepared for it. We knew it was coming,\" Mr Camarillo says. Still, it took some adjustment. When the changes were announced, the family had just bought a house. On top of the financial strain, some warn that YouTube's new rules may make it harder for new voices to emerge. The US is currently reviewing changes to the children's online privacy act. But even as stricter rules for children's ads and social media marketing grow more likely, many in the industry say they doubt it will dent the growth of online influencers. Globally, firms are expected to spend almost $10bn on \"influencer marketing\" this year, up from $6.5bn in 2019, according to industry estimates. In the toy industry, social media influencers now attract almost as much advertising spending as traditional television, says Juli Lennett of research firm NPD Group. For some firms, it can be far more. \"YouTube - it's a fact of life,\" she says. \"You kind of need to be where the kids are.\" Industry expansion About 40% of children aged 14 and under watch YouTube or YouTube kids at least weekly. More than 60% in that age range have bought something they saw in a video, according to a survey conducted last year by the NPD Group for the US Toy Association. Brian Bonnett is chief executive of Bonkers Toys, which holds the license for Ryan's toys and is working with several other families on toy lines. While many in the toy industry see the platform and its creators primarily as a vehicle for advertising, he says he expects that to change in coming years. \"It's inevitable,\" he says. \"Everybody has a YouTuber.\" This year's Toy Fair drew 100 YouTube channel owners this year, up from 90 in 2019, several of whom are represented by Hollywood agents. Viewers don't seem to mind the increased commercialism, says Lucy Maxwell, a former teacher whose family started its Tic Tac Toy channel as a hobby. They now have about 3.5 million subscribers for its videos, many of which are sponsored, and licensed a line of XOXO toys. The Maxwells - Jason, Lucy, nine-year-old Addy and seven-year-old Maya - are now looking to move beyond the toy industry into other kinds of businesses, such as publishing, apparel and home decor. \"I really think we're only on the cusp of what you're seeing as influencer marketing right now,\" says Jason, who used to work in the financial industry. \"I think it's going to be a lot bigger and this is just inning number one.\" The Camarillos have about a dozen meetings lined up at this year's Toy Fair, their third. As they walk the aisles, more emerge spontaneously, as toy reps spot the children's yellow \"creator\" badges and invite them to try out the latest bouncy balls and hula hoops. Damian says his schoolmates say he is \"famous, but I'm not really\". His goal is to hit one million subscribers on a single channel. \"I feel like a big YouTuber, but we're still kind of small,\" he says. \"We're getting there.\"", "summary": "Alors que les règles de publicité changent, les enfants influents cherchent à convertir leur statut YouTube en quelque chose de plus."}

The boy's death in September prompted a vigil in the centre of Mulhouse among residents who rallied round his parents. But the family's initial accounts of what had happened and the ensuing post-mortem examination prompted police to continue their investigation. Bruises were discovered on the boy's body, particularly on his feet, according to Alsace website DNA.

Doctors found she was still pregnant with twins in a second uterus, and performed an emergency Caesarean. Her twins were found to be healthy and were discharged with no complications. 'We were shocked' Ms Sultana, who is from a rural village, delivered her first baby at the Khulna Medical College Hospital in Khulna district. Just 26 days later, she complained of stomach pain and was rushed to the Ad-din Hospital in Jessore district on 21 March, Dr Sheila Poddar, the gynaecologist who performed the Caesarean told the BBC. Some media reports put the date as 22 March. \"When the patient came in we performed an ultrasound on her and found there were twin babies,\" Dr Poddar said. \"We were very shocked and surprised. I have never observed something like this before.\" It is unclear why she might have chosen to go to a different hospital. According to Dr Poddar, Ms Sultana and her husband are \"very poor\" and she had \"never had an ultrasound before\", in the run up to her first delivery. \"She had no idea that she had two other babies,\" said Dr Poddar. \"We carried out a caesarean and she delivered twins, one male and female.\" The 20-year-old and her newborns were discharged on 25 March after four days in hospital. \"The babies and her are all healthy. I am very, very happy that everything went well,\" Dr Poddar said. One gynaecologist in Singapore said uterus didelphys - the condition of having two uteruses - is \"not as rare as people think\". \"If you go for a scan beforehand it would be very obvious to see two sets of uteruses. But obviously they are from a more rural area [and might not have access to ultrasound scanning],\" Dr Christopher Ng of the GynaeMD Clinic told the BBC. \"[It's likely that] three eggs ovulated and were fertilised at the same time during her fertile period which resulted in three embryos.\" What is uterus didelphys? It is a disorder in which a female develops a double uterus instead of one. The uterus starts out as two small tubes in a foetus and these normally join together to form one large organ - but if they don't a double uterus may be formed. Such abnormalities vary in severity and in some cases can cause fertility problems. There are varying estimates as to how common the condition is. It is thought to affect about one in 1,000 women in the UK. Often women who have the condition do not have symptoms and it is usually discovered during pregnancy when an ultrasound scan is given. Ms Sultana said she was happy with her children but was concerned that raising them would put a strain on her financial situation, according to AFP news agency. Her husband earns less than 6,000 taka (£53; $69) a month as a labourer, but he said he would \"try his best\", AFP reported. \"It was a miracle from Allah that all my children are healthy.

She was appointed in July, just two months after the king married Queen Suthida, his fourth wife. Sineenat, who was a major-general and is a trained pilot, nurse and bodyguard, was the first person to be awarded the title of Royal Noble Consort in nearly a century. Queen Suthida - a 41-year-old former flight attendant and deputy head of his bodyguard unit - is King Vajiralongkorn's long-term partner and has been seen with him in public for many years. The announcement that Sineenat had been stripped of her titles was published in the Royal Gazette on Monday. It marked a sudden fall from grace for the royal consort, who for several years was seen often at the side of King Vajiralongkorn. Even after the king's marriage to Queen Suthida, Sineenat was a regular guest at royal events. What did the palace say? The statement published on Monday said Sineenat had \"shown resistance and pressure in every manner to stop the appointment of the Queen\" ahead of the coronation in May. \"The king gave her a royal consort position, in hopes of relieving the pressure and a problem that could affect the monarchy,\" the statement said. It also accused the royal consort of \"resistance against the king and the queen\" and of abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf. The king, the statement said, had learnt \"she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status\". He ordered her stripped of all royal titles, decorations, status in the royal guard and her military ranks. King Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne after the death of his father in 2016. What about the king's wives? He has had four wives - Princess Soamsawali from 1977 to 1993; Yuvadhida Polpraserth from 1994 to 1996; Srirasmi Suwadee between 2001 and 2014; and Queen Suthida. The true cause of Sineenat's removal as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. The nation's lese-majeste law forbids any insult of the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world. The removal of Sineenat echoes the cases of two of the King's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her. In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from court. Her 14-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland. The King has also exercised his royal powers in a more direct way than his recent predecessors. Earlier this month, the two most important army units in the capital, Bangkok were placed directly under his command - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.", "summary": "Polygame, le roi de Thaïlande dépouille sa \"noble concubine\" de ses titres de noblesse en raison de ses crises de jalousie fréquentes vis-à-vis de la reine."}

But as he was rushed the hospital, the main concern of the then 29-year-old was his collapsing business back in the UK. A self-made millionaire, Andy had built up a property, hotels and bars empire. And he lived a life of luxury. In addition to the 130ft (38m) boat he flew his own aircraft and drove two Ferraris. Yet over-extended on his loans, when the 2008 global financial crisis hit he lost everything. \"When I was in my 20s the banks were throwing money at me,\" he says. \"As I had never seen an economic downturn I didn't realise the downside to that. Then the financial crisis happened, and I literally got wiped out. I avoided going bankrupt, but I lost about £6m. Everything was repossessed.\" Andy says he was initially hit by dark depression, but then he vowed to rebuild his business - and his life. \"I said to myself 'just belief in yourself, you have done this before, you can make it back'.\" And that he did. Today, 11 years later, his London-based company - REL Capital - has a reported annual turnover of £30m, and his personal wealth is said to be around £25m. Born and raised in Portsmouth on England's south coast, Andy says he got his drive to earn money from his father-in-law who owned a number of sweet shops. A keen rugby player and amateur boxer, Andy started to work as a doorman at Portsmouth nightclubs in 1995 when he was just 16. \"It seems very young, but it was legal to do the job at that age back then, and I was a big lad,\" says the now 40-year-old. \"It could be a bit rough - I was bottled a couple of times - but I actually really enjoyed the work.\" Then when he was 18 he inherited £5,000 from his grandmother, and he decided to buy a very run down terrace house. \"Even back then that was not a lot of money for a home, so it needed turning back to basics,\" he says. \"But I did it up, and doubled my money. And I was up and running.\" Andy was soon buying ever more houses to renovate and sell. So much so that he says he had developed 250 by the time he was 25. He was also buying and running hotels, bars and a hair salon. Then 2008 arrived, and after the accident it took three months before he was able to walk again. Needing an income he then returned to working as a bouncer and also as a builder. He did want to go straight back into buying property again, \"but nobody wanted to lend to someone who had almost gone bankrupt\". Eventually a friend agreed to lend him some money to turn a disused church and a former cinema into nightclubs. Both venues were successful, and Andy says he was able to build up his business again from there, always keeping his eye out for takeover opportunities. Today his company - REL Capital - owns everything from a pubs and bars chain, to haulage firms, recruitment companies, and a business that supplies music festivals. \"It is diverse, but I have experience of all the sectors that we work in,\" he says. \"What we specialise in doing is buying and turning around struggling but established firms. Such as a 10-year-old business that has just run out of steam.\" Andy describes himself as a \"dealmaker\", and after he has bought a new company he appoints managers to run it. \"I learned very early on about my strengths and weaknesses,\" he says. \"I'm terrible at the details, but very good at the numbers, getting deals done and moving on.\" Looking back on how he successfully rebuilt his business empire, Andy says it was frustrating that no banks would back him the second time around. He says that in the US lenders are \"much more forgiving\" of businessmen and women who have had an initial setback. More The Boss features: Eleanor Shaw, professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Strathclyde, agrees that the UK needs to follow the example of the US. \"In the US, entrepreneurs are not necessarily disadvantaged on the basis of having previously 'failed',\" she says. \"Instead, investors are interested in what they learned, and what they would do differently if they were to secure funding. \"It would be helpful if. in the UK business world. we could reassess our relationship with so called failure, and instead recognise it as a learning opportunity.\" Julian Birkinshaw, professor of entrepreneurship at London Business School, says that the situation has improved in the UK's technology sector, but not yet across the economy as a whole. \"I can think of many people who have had failed [technology] ventures who subsequently received money,\" he says. \"As long as you can show what you learned, how you pivoted to a new opportunity, the appetite for funding is still there.\" Back at Andy's London headquarters, he says that while his business is now bigger than it was prior to 2008, he now lives more modestly. \"When you have lost everything it makes you more humble,\" he says. \"I have learned from my mistakes, I used to have a big overdraft, but now I don't have any debt. And I used to have Ferraris, but now I have a moped, or I just walk.\"", "summary": "La série hebdomadaire de la BBC intitulée 'The Boss' présente différents chefs d'entreprise du monde entier."}

This includes \"multi-system inflammation\" with flu-like symptoms. Some, but not all, tested positive for coronavirus. It is unclear how many children have experienced the reaction, although the numbers will be low. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said they had become aware of reports of rare, severe illness in children. \"It's only in the last few days that we have seen those reports. We have asked our experts to look into this as a matter of urgency.\" The alert, issued by NHS England, said there was \"a growing concern\" that a coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infection linked to these cases. These young patients of varying ages were extremely ill. They had similar features to atypical Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome, which can include a high temperature, low blood pressure, a rash and difficulty breathing. Some also had gastrointestinal symptoms - tummy pain, vomiting or diarrhoea - and inflammation of the heart, as well as abnormal blood test results. Experts say these are the signs you can see when the body becomes overwhelmed as it tries to fight off an infection. The alert advises these cases need urgent treatment. But experts stress that very few children become severely ill with coronavirus - evidence from around the world suggests they are the population least affected by the disease. Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in Paediatric Intensive Care in Cambridge, said colleagues in Spain and Italy had been reporting similar cases: \"Some of the children have presented with a septic shock type illness and rashes - the kind of presentation we would expect to see in toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease (which affects blood vessels and the heart). \"Overall, children seem to be more resilient to serious lung infection following exposure to coronavirus, and the numbers admitted to intensive care units are relatively low.\" NHS England said it knew of fewer than 20 such cases in the country where an association has been noted by clinicians. Investigations will continue, but no link has yet been established, said a spokesman. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said parents should be reassured by this, but if they are concerned about their children's health for any reason, they should seek help from a health professional. Prof Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people, said: \"The advice to parents remains the same: if you are worried about your child for whatever reason, contact NHS 111 or your family doctor for urgent advice, or 999 in an emergency, and if a professional tells you to go to hospital, please go to hospital.\" When to seek help Whilst coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself. The RCPCH advises parents seek urgent help (call 999 or go to A&E) if their child is:", "summary": "Les médecins du NHS (système de la santé publique du Royaume-Uni) ont été avertis de faire attention à une réaction rare mais dangereuse chez les enfants, qui pourrait être liée à une infection par un coronavirus."}

They need to do something to get their voices seen and heard.\" Paul, who worked in advertising for 11 years, thinks the approach will ultimately damage a brand's reputation. \"To a degree Chance is kind of right in the sense that it's deliberately being provocative and it's trying to get the headlines - and it's working in that respect. That's the key word - respect. That's what it comes back down to. \"And this ultimately is going to be much more damaging for brands than what they actually realise.\" The UK's advertising watchdog, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), has received 2396 racism complaints since 2013 about 956 different ads. Of those, 12 cases were formally investigated and 10 of those had the complaint upheld. The ASA has the power to ban adverts it thinks breaches its standards. One of its most recent cases was a complaint against Paddy Power for an advert featuring boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, which encouraged readers to \"always bet on black\". It banned the advert because it was \"likely to cause serious offence on the grounds of race\", and told the bookies not to make the same mistake again. Kubi Springer is the founder of global branding agency She Builds Brands and has worked with the likes of L'Oreal and the Mobo Awards. She says that despite adverts being looked at by lots of people before they make it to the public, a \"lack of diversity\" in advertising agencies means things can be missed. \"I wouldn't go as far as to say [brands are making] innocent mistakes, but also wouldn't go as far as Chance the Rapper and say they are being deliberately racist. \"You need people at management and senior manager level that are diverse - and that's both ethnicity, as well as the LGBT community, as well as women who will say 'Actually this might offend a particular demographic and maybe you should think about this again'.\" A 2017 survey by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising found that 12.9% of employees in the ad industry were from a black or ethnic minority background. Sarah Jenkins, the chief marketing officer at advertising agency Grey London, doesn't believe any brand would put out a racist ad on purpose. Her agency has set up a diversity task force - which has the support of around 20 advertising agencies - to help the industry attract more representative employees. Like Kubi, she thinks a lack of diversity within the industry means some brands may not realise their ads could be seen as inappropriate. She says: \"Although we're seeing some bad campaigns there are some brilliant agencies and initiatives in place. \"I think what we've done with the diversity task force is pull together the biggest and most forward-thinking ad agencies in the UK and we're working together and using our skills to attract the best talent. \"That's not because we're worried about getting things wrong, it's a more positive reason. It's because when we are diverse we get better ideas, we get different perspectives and different approaches and the work simply gets better.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Of those, 400,000 were Muslim soldiers. The Muslim Experience is working to highlight the global contribution of Muslim soldiers to World War One and says raising awareness could silence anti-Muslim rhetoric by far-right groups in Britain today. Mr Bhabha says his team is now opening up documents and discovering new information about their role in the War. \"Accessing archives from 19 countries, we have discovered that more than four million Muslims either fought or served as labourers during the War, from around the world,\" he says. One of those was Sepoy Khudadad Khan, an Indian soldier who fought alongside British troops. He was the sole survivor of a team assigned to defend vital ports in France and Belgium from German forces. According to accounts, Khan managed to hold off the enemy advance long enough for British reinforcements to arrive. On 31 October 1914, Khan, of the 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis Regiment, became the first South Asian to receive the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honour. 'Feel more British' Groups such as the Muslim Experience want stories of soldiers to be heard. They also want more British Muslims to find out if they have a personal connection to World War One. Just as a local GP in Nottingham, Dr Irfan Malik, did after he had a chance conversation with a patient that led him to discover two of his great-grandfathers had fought for Britain. Dr Malik's great-grandparents, Capt Ghulam Mohammad and Subedar Mohammad Khan, were two of 460 soldiers from a tiny village called Dulmial, in modern-day Pakistan, sent to fight in the 1914-18 conflict. \"One of my patients is a researcher of Commonwealth contribution to World War One and I told him about a village in modern-day Pakistan where I'm from that has a cannon commemorating the Great War,\" he says. \"From that point four years ago, my journey began and I found out my two great-grandparents fought for Britain. \"I'm very fortunate to have images from 100 years ago. It means a huge amount to me. It's made me feel more British as we have this shared history in common and I believe it helps community cohesion.\" But how connected do British Muslims feel to the War and how aware is the community itself of its links to British military history? Mr Bhabha thinks some young Muslims in particular are not engaged with British military history. \"Most Muslims are not engaged with military history because they can't relate to it,\" he says. \"The way it is taught currently is very European-centric. \"The history that is taught doesn't show the true diversity of everyone that took part in the First World War.\" A study by think tank British Future found just 22% of people in Britain knew Muslims had fought in the Great War. So, it has launched a campaign, Remember Together, to raise awareness in schools. Steve Ballinger, from British Future, says: \"Finding out that Muslim soldiers fought and died for Britain to protect us and to protect the freedoms we enjoy today, that's an important history for everyone to know.\" It has certainly meant a lot to Daleesha Naz, 14, of Eden Girls School, in east London. \"Today I learned that 400,000 Muslims fought in the British Indian army and it has made me feel closer and more connected to British history,\" she says. As the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One is remembered, historians, campaigners, and descendants of the soldiers are making sure the contribution of Muslims is never forgotten. Luc Ferrier, who chairs Forgotten Heroes 14-19 - the umbrella group for the Muslim Experience - says: \"If the world really wants to reach out to the international Muslim community, then they need to know the enormous contribution these people have made, fighting a war none of their making. \"Only by recognising and honouring the global Muslim sacrifices, not only these of the British colonies, we are reaching out to them and saying a genuine thank you\".", "summary": "Cent ans après la fin de la Première Guerre mondiale, les historiens pensent que le fait de reconnaître la contribution des musulmans peut aider à résoudre des problèmes contemporains tels que l'islamophobie."}

However, the Verge news site revealed that Google now holds on to the data unless users take active measures to stop it. Google has confirmed the U-turn. Privacy campaigners say the public must be kept informed about how their records are handled. \"It's important that citizens are given enough information about what will happen to their data for them make an informed choice about whether or not they want to use this service,\" said Daniel Nesbitt, research director at Big Brother Watch. \"This includes who may be able to access it and where the data will be stored\". Virtual assistant Allo was first announced at the Google IO event in May. At the time, it said chat records would be \"transiently\" stored on its servers. This was required to provide the app's standout feature - the inclusion of the Google Assistant, a tool that provides context-relevant suggestions. For example, if two people are discussing Italian food, the Assistant can be asked within the conversation to give details of nearby restaurants or how to prepare a dish. Google's support documents state that a user can opt to wipe their chat history and add that it holds onto people's data to provide them with \"a more personalised experience\". But when first asked, the firm was unable to clarify whether it had abandoned plans to delete chats without being prompted. Allo itself handled privacy queries by providing a link to the Verge. However, a spokeswoman later confirmed the change of policy. \"We've given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo,\" she told the BBC. \"Our approach is simple - your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it. You can delete single messages or entire conversations.\" 'Smarter experience' Allo does offer an Incognito mode - which encrypts the chats in a form that prevents the Assistant listening in or the authorities being able to get an unscrambled copy - but this is not enabled by default. That contrasts with the approach of Whatsapp, which holds on to messages only until they have been delivered, and Telegram and Apple's iMessage, which promise never to scan users' communications. \"Google has a challenge as there are already a lot of big players with chat apps with very established audiences,\" said Jack Kent, from the IHS Technology consultancy. \"With messaging it's not just about acquiring one user, it's about acquiring the network of users. \"Google is trying to do that by offering a smarter messaging experience, and to do that it needs the data to learn about its users. \"But it needs to be careful about how it communicates that.\"", "summary": "Google a lancé sa nouvelle application de messagerie, avec des mesures de protection de la vie privée revues à la baisse."}

Cambridge researchers say it consumes around 121.36 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year - and is unlikely to fall unless the value of the currency slumps. Critics say electric-car firm Tesla's decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin undermines its environmental image. The currency's value hit a record $48,000 (£34,820) this week. following Tesla's announcement that it had bought about $1.5bn bitcoin and planned to accept it as payment in future. But the rising price offers even more incentive to Bitcoin miners to run more and more machines. And as the price increases, so does the energy consumption, according to Michel Rauchs, researcher at The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, who co-created the online tool that generates these estimates. “It is really by design that Bitcoin consumes that much electricity,” Mr Rauchs told BBC’s Tech Tent podcast. “This is not something that will change in the future unless the Bitcoin price is going to significantly go down.\" The online tool has ranked Bitcoin’s electricity consumption above Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh) - and it is gradually creeping up on Norway (122.20 TWh). The energy it uses could power all kettles used in the UK for 27 years, it said. However, it also suggests the amount of electricity consumed every year by always-on but inactive home devices in the US alone could power the entire Bitcoin network for a year. Mining Bitcoin In order to \"mine\" Bitcoin, computers - often specialised ones - are connected to the cryptocurrency network. They have the job of verifying transactions made by people who send or receive Bitcoin. This process involves solving puzzles, which, while not integral to verifying movements of the currency, provide a hurdle to ensure no-one fraudulently edits the global record of all transactions. As a reward, miners occasionally receive small amounts of Bitcoin in what is often likened to a lottery. To increase profits, people often connect large numbers of miners to the network - even entire warehouses full of them. That uses lots of electricity because the computers are more or less constantly working to complete the puzzles. The University of Cambridge tool models the economic lifetime of the world's Bitcoin miners and assumes that all the Bitcoin mining machines worldwide are working with various efficiencies. Using an average electricity price per kilowatt hour ($0.05) and the energy demands of the Bitcoin network, it is then possible to estimate how much electricity is being consumed at any one time. Environmental conundrum “Bitcoin is literally anti-efficient,” David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, explained. “So more efficient mining hardware won't help - it'll just be competing against other efficient mining hardware. “This means that Bitcoin's energy use, and hence its CO2 production, only spirals outwards. “It’s very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery.” The price of Bitcoin rose rapidly on Monday after Tesla announced its investment. But commentators say the investment clashes with the electric car firm's previous environmental stance. “Elon Musk has thrown away a lot of Tesla's good work promoting energy transition,” Mr Gerard said. “This is very bad... I don't know how he can walk this back effectively. \"Tesla got $1.5bn in environmental subsidies in 2020, funded by the taxpayer. \"It turned around and spent $1.5bn on Bitcoin, which is mostly mined with electricity from coal. Their subsidy needs to be examined.\" A carbon tax on cryptocurrencies could be introduced to balance out some of the negative consumption, Mr Gerard suggested.", "summary": "Bitcoin consomme plus d'électricité par an que l'ensemble de l'Argentine, selon une analyse de l'université de Cambridge."}

The railway magnate had been inspired by the 984ft (300m) tall Eiffel Tower, which was unveiled beside the River Seine in 1889. He wanted London to have one of its own. \"Like other Victorian men of the era he wanted to make his impact on the world,\" said Jason Sayer, of the London School of Architecture. \"The tower was to be his legacy.\" The Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest man-made structure when construction finished in 1889. Initially derided by some for being a monstrous addition to the city's fine architecture, it went on to become a global tourist attraction, recouping its £260,000 construction costs in the first seven months and becoming the perennial back drop for Parisian postcards. Sir Edward wanted Great Britain to have an equivalent. But, instead of building a rival tower in central London, he believed a marsh on the city's outskirts would be the perfect spot. He had bought 280 acres of land in the Wembley area as part of his grand scheme to build an entire new community, connected to the city of London by the Metropolitan Railway, of which he had been chairman since 1872. His tower was meant to be the beacon for his new suburban paradise, comfortable homes set in pleasant parklands just a 12 minute train ride from Baker Street station. The poor would be able to swap the over-crowded disease-infested streets of central London for healthy country air. His park would also encourage city-dwellers to enjoy days out on his railway, with a trip up the tower being the icing on the cake. \"There was a lot of British pride going around at the time and he wanted to typify the country's global achievements,\" Mr Sayer said. \"Part of it was down to him trying to do some public good, although how much the public needs a tower is debatable, but mostly it was down to his own ego.\" His park, which included a boating lake, waterfall and various sporting grounds, opened in May 1894 and quickly became popular with some 100,000 visitors in its first few months. Those ambling lazily around the large green gardens would have heard the heavy clanking of metal as work continued on Sir Edward's tower. But work was not going well. It had been designed by the London architects Stewart, McLaren and Dunn, who had seen off 67 competitors for the 500 Guinea prize. Sir Edward had actually approached Gustave Eiffel to take on his tower, but the architect of the Parisian masterpiece politely declined, fearing his compatriots might think him \"not so good a Frenchman as I hope I am\" if he helped the English build a bigger tower than France's. Some of the designs had been fantastical and patently impractical, if not impossible. One was a 2,000ft high tower shaped like a multi-tiered wedding cake with a working railway spiralling up it. Another was described as an \"aerial colony\" complete with hanging vegetable gardens and a scale replica of the Great Pyramid on its summit. Stewart, McLaren and Dunn's winning entry closely resembled the Eiffel Tower, although it was made of steel as opposed to iron and, at 1,150ft (350m), was some 165ft (50m) taller than the Parisian centrepiece. It was to feature a 90-bedroom hotel, restaurant, theatre, shops, Turkish baths, winter gardens and promenades, as well as a weather station and observatory at the top. But Wembley was the wrong place for such a project for two main reasons. Firstly, the ground was muddy and marshy and prone to subsidence. The first stage of the tower, consisting of four giant legs supporting a plateau 155ft (47m) in the air, was completed a short while after the park's opening. But it was soon developing an ominous lean that was even more pronounced two years later. Secondly, it was too far from central London. \"Wembley was not the equivalent of the location of the Eiffel Tower to put it mildly,\" said Christopher Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society. \"People would get there and find there was not much to see, certainly no panoramic view of London. \"If he had built it in Hyde Park it would probably have been a roaring success.\" Sir Edward's hopes that his even partially built tower would enjoy the same immediate success as the Eiffel Tower were quickly dashed. Public interest in it waned with visitors donating only £27,000 of the £220,000 required. Sir Edward ploughed £100,000 of his own money into it, but by the end of 1894, work had ceased. In a bid to reignite public excitement, lifts were installed in 1896 to allow people to get up to the platform. However, during its first six months only 18,500 people paid to do so. The tower once mooted to be named after Queen Victoria became known instead as the \"Shareholders' Dismay\", \"London Stump\" and \"Watkin's Folly\". Sir Edward, who had also made an ill-fated attempt to dig a Channel tunnel in the 1880s, died in 1901. The following year his much-vaunted tower was closed to the public and in 1906 it was finally torn down. Though Sir Edward's tower was a failure, his vision for Wembley was not. The park's leisure facilities proved popular and became a venue for large-scale gatherings. Wembley's place in the list of global icons would be assured when, in 1923, a magnificent new stadium, complete with twin towers, opened to host the FA Cup final between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. In 2002, when the stadium was torn down to be replaced by another landmark ground, workmen found large concrete foundations beneath the pitch. They were the first and last pieces of London's answer to the Eiffel Tower.", "summary": "Avant que Wembley n'ait son stade de football mondialement connu, un magnat victorien des chemins de fer avait des plans encore plus ambitieux pour transformer les champs marécageux de l'arrondissement en une réponse de Londres à la Tour Eiffel à Paris."}

Mr Trump focused on business dealings by his rival's son Hunter Biden in China, while the Democratic candidate highlighted Mr Trump's Chinese bank account. During the same think tank discussion on Wednesday, John Demers, chief of the justice department's national security division, said hundreds of Chinese researchers with ties to their country's military had been identified by FBI investigators over the summer. Mr Demers said the inquiry began when US authorities arrested five or six Chinese researchers who had hidden their affiliation with the People's Liberation Army (PLA). \"Those five or six arrests were just the tip of the iceberg and honestly the size of the iceberg was one that I don't know that we or other folks realised how large it was,\" he said. He told the discussion that after the FBI conducted dozens of interviews with other individuals, \"more than 1,000 PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers left the country\".

The US state department said back then it would only welcome Chinese students \"who do not further the Chinese Communist Party's goals of military dominance\". In July, the state department also closed China's consulate in Houston, Texas, accusing Beijing of stealing intellectual property.

After tweeting an apology, in which he called the tweet a \"stupid unthinking gag pic\", Baker said the BBC's decision \"was a masterclass of pompous faux-gravity\". \"[It] took a tone that said I actually meant that ridiculous tweet and the BBC must uphold blah blah blah,\" he added. \"Literally threw me under the bus. Could hear the suits' knees knocking.\" Harry and Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is African American, revealed on Wednesday their new son was named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. After the initial backlash on social media on Wednesday, Baker said: \"Sorry my gag pic of the little fella in the posh outfit has whipped some up. Never occurred to me because, well, mind not diseased. 'Enormous mistake' \"Soon as those good enough to point out its possible connotations got in touch, down it came. And that's it.\" In a later tweet, he added: \"Would have used same stupid pic for any other Royal birth or Boris Johnson kid or even one of my own. It's a funny image. (Though not of course in that context.) Enormous mistake, for sure. Grotesque. \"Anyway, here's to ya Archie, Sorry mate.\" Speaking to reporters outside his home, he said of the tweet: \"Ill advised, ill thought-out and stupid, but racist? No, I'm aware how delicate that imagery is.\" Broadcaster Scarlette Douglas, who works on 5 Live podcast The Sista Collective and The One Show, told the BBC: \"I think somebody told him, 'What you've tweeted was incorrect, so you should maybe say something or take it down.' \"Yes, OK, he took it down, but his apology for me wasn't really an apology. I don't think it's right and I think subsequently what's happened is correct.\" Ayesha Hazarika, a commentator and former adviser to the Labour Party, told 5 Live she was \"genuinely gobsmacked\" by the tweet. \"I couldn't believe it,\" she said. \"I thought it was a joke at first. I thought it was a spoof. It was so crass. What was going through his head? \"You can't just say sorry and then carry on like it's business as usual. When you have an incredibly important platform like he does, you do have to think about what you do and the signals that it sends out.\" Prompt action Baker must have been aware of recent incidences of racism at football matches and the resulting outcry, Ms Hazarika added. Linda Bellos, former chairwoman of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Professionals, echoed those remarks. saying: \"A lot of black players are complaining about noises being made to them. He knows this stuff,\" she told Radio 4. His tweet was \"foolish\", she said, adding: \"Never mind that it's royalty. \"The things that are happening to black children up and down the country are not enhanced by his words and I'm glad that prompt action has been taken, and let's hope we have come thoughtful dialogue and learning from this.\" Baker's Saturday Morning show on BBC Radio 5 Live won him a Sony Gold award for Speech Radio Personality of the Year in 2011, 2012 and 2014 and a Gold Award for entertainment show of the year in 2013. His irrepressible style made him one of the most popular radio presenters of his generation and saw him described by one writer as the \"ultimate geezer\". Baker was also a successful magazine journalist, scriptwriter and TV documentary maker. He wrote a number of TV shows including Pets Win Prizes and Win, Lose or Draw and, in 1990, The Game, a series about an amateur soccer team in east London. A stint at BBC London station GLR in the late '80s saw him strike up an enduring friendship with fellow broadcaster Chris Evans, and Baker would later write scripts for the Channel 4 show TFI Friday, which Evans hosted. Controversial comments It's the second time Baker has been axed by 5 Live and is the third time he has left the BBC. In 1997, he was fired for encouraging football fans to make a referee's life hell after the official had awarded a controversial penalty in an FA Cup tie. He later claimed he had never incited fans to attack the referee, only that he would have understood if they had. In 2012, two weeks before he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, he was was back in the news after an on-air rant in which he resigned and branded his bosses at BBC London \"pinheaded weasels\". The outburst came after Baker had been asked to move from a weekday programme to a weekend. In 2016, Baker took part on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here but was the first person to be voted off in the series. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

A number of daily pills and a long-acting injectable contraceptive are thought to be affected. The problem follows a shortage of hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women last year. But there are signs that those supply difficulties might soon start to be resolved as a key ingredient is now being manufactured again. It is currently unclear what has caused the contraception shortages. Drug firm Pfizer first reported supply problems with Sayana Press, which provides three months' protection and can be self-administered by women, last year. It is the only self-injectable contraceptive on the market and is also used to help women control period-related problems, such as heavy bleeding. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare said there were also now shortages of a number of daily pills, including Noriday, Norimin and Synphase. 'I was upset' Nikki Heresford, 34, from Lancashire, had been using Sayana Press to control her periods. She liked the fact she could administer the injection herself as it meant she did not have to take time off work to make regular trips to the doctor's. But when she ran out of her supply last autumn she did not find out there were supply issues until she went to her local pharmacy to pick up her next prescription. She said it left her \"upset\" because she had no choice but to start using another injectable contraceptive. She managed to get a last-minute appointment at her GP surgery to have the injection that time. But this week when she needed another one, she could not get an appointment for five weeks so was forced to travel to an evening clinic at a community health centre. \"It's obviously inconvenient as I have to drag my five-year-old to the next town when he should be in bed.\" It is unclear how many women use these types of contraception - overall around three million women take daily pills, and more than 500,000 use long-acting contraception, such as coils, implants and injections. The Royal College of GPs said its members were doing their best to help women find alternatives - there are many different types of daily pill available. Faculty president Dr Asha Kasliwal said; \"We are aware that women are sent away with prescriptions for unavailable products and end up lost in a system. This is causing utter chaos.\" The faculty has teamed up with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Menopause Society to write to ministers, asking them to set up a working group to address the problems. The letter warns women are becoming distressed by having to find alternative products that might not necessarily suit them or go without contraception altogether. It said this was affecting the \"physical and mental wellbeing of girls and women\" and could lead to a \"rise in unplanned pregnancies and abortions\". The government in England said it was working with manufacturers to resolve the problems and expected the shortages to ease soon.", "summary": "La pénurie de moyens de contraception est source de chaos et risque de provoquer des grossesses non désirées et des avortements au Royaume Uni, préviennent les médecins."}

Mr Hague told MPs the UK and Sweden would seek assurances about his human rights if a \"third country\" sought to try him for disclosing documents. He called for further meetings with Ecuador to resolve the row. Mr Assange, a 41-year-old Australian citizen, denies assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010 and says the sex was consensual. Death penalty safeguards Swedish prosecutors, who want to question Mr Assange, have dismissed his claims that their case is part of a wider political move to see him stand trial in the US over his work with Wikileaks. Mr Assange has said he fears he could face the death penalty if convicted in the US, but BBC correspondents say the Human Rights Act prevents the UK or Sweden from being able to extradite people for trial in countries where they could face such a sentence. And in a written statement to Parliament, Mr Hague said: \"As we have discussed with the government of Ecuador, the United Kingdom and Sweden robustly implement and adhere to the highest standards of human rights protection. \"The suggestion that Mr Assange's human rights would be put at risk by the possibility of onward extradition from Sweden to a third country is also without foundation... \"In practice, this means that the United Kingdom could only consent to Mr Assange's onward extradition from Sweden to a third country if satisfied that extradition would be compatible with his human rights, and that there was no prospect of a death sentence being imposed or carried out.\" Supreme Court rejection Mr Assange has been staying at Ecuador's London embassy since June. The UK Supreme Court dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition and gave him a two-week grace period - during which he entered the embassy in Knightsbridge, west London - before proceedings could start. Mr Hague said suggestions that extradition to Sweden posed a risk to Assange's human rights were also \"completely unfounded\" and had been \"comprehensively rejected\" by UK courts. He added there was \"no legal basis\" for the government to accept Ecuador's decision to grant Mr Assange asylum and allow him safe passage out of the UK. The foreign secretary said there had been seven formal discussions as well as many other conversations and written exchanges with Ecuador in an attempt to reach an acceptable resolution. Most recently, Mr Hague had a meeting with Ecuador's Vice-President, Lenin Moreno, on 29 August in London, during his visit to the Paralympics. Mr Hague said: \"We wish to continue our dialogue with the government of Ecuador. We believe that our two countries should be able to find a diplomatic solution. \"We have invited the government of Ecuador to resume, as early as possible, the discussions we have held on this matter to date.\" A spokesman for the Ecuadorian government in London said Mr Hague's statement only partially addressed its concerns and did not \"specifically\" refer to the US. \"While we accept that there are provisions in the European Human Rights Convention that stops the extradition of a suspect if they face the death penalty, what the UK government have failed to address over the last three months, including today, is the inhumane treatment that Mr Assange would face were he to be extradited to the USA, including solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, limited access to legal representatives and punitive sentencing should he be found guilty in a military of special court,\" he said. \"If the UK provided these basic human rights guarantees then we believe that there would be a quick, fair and honourable solution to the present impasse.\"", "summary": "Le fondateur de WikiLeaks Julian Assange est prêt à se rendre aux Etats-Unis, où il fait face à de lourdes accusations, si ses droits sont garantis, a annoncé mercredi le site internet."}

I witnessed and filmed many children, some just five years old, being severely beaten, routinely shackled, and imprisoned without food and water by the sheikhs, or religious men, in charge of the schools. Some of the children who did not appear in our documentary told me they had been raped or experienced other forms of sexual abuse. There are nearly 30,000 khalwas across the country, according to the Sudanese government. They receive money from the government and private donors both in Sudan and around the world. Children are taught to memorise the Koran. Because they charge no fees, many families consider them an alternative to mainstream education, especially in remote villages that may not have government-run schools. Students board there, only returning home for the holidays. To many people the schools, which have been operating for generations, are a central element of Sudanese culture, seen as part of the national identity. However, in recent years, videos of children being beaten in the schools have been widely shared on social media, and there have been stories in local media of sheikhs accused of rape in the khalwas. The media, the government and even human rights organisations have ignored this. I wanted to expose how widespread the abuse was, and give a voice to these children who don't have the opportunity to share their stories. And I had had my own experiences. As a teenager, I attended a khalwa. Every day was a trial to avoid being beaten by the teachers. I knew I'd fall out with friends and family over this investigation, but the story needed to be told. Even though along the way, I would be accused of being part of a \"Western plot to attack religious education\" by some of the people I spoke to. By the time I contacted the BBC, I had already spent several months filming undercover on my own. One of the first khalwas I visited was called Haj el-Daly, where I had been told abuses took place. I slipped into the school's mosque to pray with everyone else at noon prayers, secretly filming on my phone as I did so. As I knelt, I heard a clanging sound. My heart stopped. I looked up and saw the children in front of me had their legs bound in chains, shackled like animals. Prayers ended, and the children shuffled out. But as I made to leave I heard violent shouting and muffled crying. I followed the sound to a dimly lit study room nearby, where I found a child quietly sobbing, his legs chained together. I began to secretly film what I was seeing. This was Ahmed. He told me he wanted to go home. I tried to reassure him but I could hear the voices of the sheikhs approaching, stopped filming and left the khalwa. You can watch the full documentary tonight on BBC2 at 23:30. It will be available on iPlayer shortly afterwards. But I returned the following day so I could reveal more about what was happening there. As I was talking to the children, trying to film them with my phone, I noticed an older student watching me. He left suddenly and moments later returned with the sheikh in charge of the school. The sheikh started shouting at me, asking why I was filming the students. I managed to quickly run out of the door into the street. Haj el-Daly's management have since told the BBC that there is a new sheikh in charge of the school and that the beating and chaining has stopped. Memories of my own khalwa I got home feeling shaken - if the confrontation with the sheikh had escalated, no-one would have known where I was. But I was also traumatised by what I had seen. It brought back memories of my own time in a khalwa as a teenager, where beatings were commonplace, though no-one was shackled. I had been so excited for my first day at that khalwa when I was 14, trying on my jalabiya - traditional dress - and impatiently waiting for morning. But early on, I could tell something was not right. I noticed the other children seemed afraid of the sheikhs and the teachers. The abuse began in the evening sessions. If we were sleepy and closed our eyes, the sheikh would whip us. That would certainly wake us up. I stayed in the khalwa for about a month, enduring many beatings. When I returned home, I told my parents that I didn't want to go back, although I didn't feel I could tell them about the abuse I had suffered. They weren't happy about me breaking off my studies, but they didn't force me to return. Following the altercation with the sheikh in charge of Haj el-Daly, I was finding it difficult to get my confidence back to continue filming in the khalwas. I took my evidence to the Arab Reporters in Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), who put me in touch with BBC News Arabic. From that point, everything changed. My editor in London assigned me a producer, Mamdouh Akbik. He's Syrian and I'm Sudanese, and although we both speak Arabic, our dialects are very different. But it wasn't long before we were working together really well. Hear Mamdouh talking to BBC radio's Fifth Floor about his experience working on the film here. We mapped out the khalwas, we gathered evidence, and we talked about safety and logistics throughout. But the real game changer was when I received the secret recording equipment. It gave me the confidence to continue my work. Sudan is a vast country, encompassing mountains, the Red Sea and wide desert plains. During the course of the investigation, I must have covered 3,000 miles of it, mostly by bus. I met families whose sons had been badly abused. In some cases they had died while at the schools and it was difficult to establish a cause of death. Sheikhs wield so much power and influence in their communities that it's rare for families to press charges against them. Cases that do make it to court are often drawn out for so long that many families give up. Or they end up settling for compensation. The hard-fought battle against the sheikhs by the families in our film is the exception, not the rule. Many families genuinely believe that the sheikhs want what's best for their students, and if \"mistakes\" happen, it's God's will. My own family share these beliefs and I had to keep my investigation secret from them. This was particularly difficult when I visited a khalwa in our home town in North Darfur, where many of my relatives still live. After the film was aired, I was kicked out of the extended family WhatsApp group. I thought they would at least want to ask me questions or debate with me, but instead they treated me like a stranger. But I got calls from my parents, who told me they would support me, although they were very worried about my safety. I was relieved that my family was so understanding. The reaction to the film The film has had a huge impact in Sudan. The families at the centre of our investigation have been overwhelmed with offers of financial, legal and emotional support from people in their local communities and around the world. There's been an outcry on social media, with people calling for the khalwas to be shut, while others have said our documentary is an attack on Islam and have accused the BBC of anti-Islam propaganda. But one powerful voice has been conspicuously slow to respond: Sudan's transitional government, who over the past year have been talking about reforming khalwas. In our film Sudan's minister for religious affairs, Nasreddine Mufreh, said that there would be no more \"beating, torture, violation of human rights or children's rights whatsoever\" inside khalwas. But we are yet to see any real change. After the documentary was aired, the Sudanese government said they would be prosecuting all the schools the BBC had filmed in. They also issued a law prohibiting the beating of children in educational institutions and stopped funding all khalwas while they are carrying out a review of the schools. All of these developments are signs that Sudan is dealing with the ghosts of its recent past, but the presence of thousands of children, chained and abused in khalwas, continues to haunt the country. Whether the government will act is a test of its will to challenge the powerful religious establishment in Sudan.

The balladeer, artist and actor is the first American to win since novelist Toni Morrison in 1993. President Obama said the honour was \"well-deserved\". \"Congratulations to one of my favourite poets,\" he wrote on Twitter. Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Dylan had been chosen because he was \"a great poet in the English speaking tradition\". \"For 54 years now he's been at it reinventing himself, constantly creating a new identity,\" she told reporters in Stockholm. The singer is due to perform later at the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas. Dylan - who took his stage name from the poet Dylan Thomas - had long been tipped as a potential prize recipient. Few experts, though, expected the academy to extend the award to a genre such as folk rock music. Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion is among those to have previously praised Dylan's lyrics, saying his songs \"work as poems\". \"They have often extremely skilful rhyming aspects to them,\" he told the BBC. \"They're often the best words in the best order.\" Analysis by Colin Paterson, entertainment correspondent Bob Dylan - the first person to win a Nobel Prize the same day as he plays a gig in Las Vegas. What makes a man who has only ever written three books a suitable winner of the Nobel Prize for literature? Bob Dylan arguably made the lyrics more important than the music. Last Friday Dylan supported The Rolling Stones at the Desert Trip Festival in California and his set included Rainy Day Women #12 & 35 from that very album. It is a song with the refrain \"everybody must get stoned,\" leading to decades-long debates about whether it deals with Old Testament-style punishment or a call to smoke cannabis. Or most probably both. Few would argue that is one of his finest lyrics, but it does demonstrate the mixture of political questioning, religious exploration and interest in humanity which has been woven through his work for more than 50 years and has secured him this award. The result also demonstrates a real change for the prize. In 112 years, no songwriter has ever won before. The decision elevates song lyrics to being on a critical par with literature, poetry and playwriting. It's a big step away from the self-perpetuating intellectualism and elitism for which the award had been criticised. Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in 1941 and began his musical career in Minnesota before heading for New York. Much of his best-known work dates from the 1960s, when he became an informal historian of America's troubles. Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They are A-Changin' were among anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements. His move away from traditional folk songwriting, paired with a controversial decision to \"go electric\" proved equally influential. Dylan's many albums include Highway 61 Revisited in 1965, Blonde on Blonde in 1966 and Blood on the Tracks in 1975. Since the late 1980s he has toured persistently, an undertaking that has been dubbed by some the \"Never-Ending Tour\". Recent winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: The estate of late Beatle George Harrison, which whom Dylan performed as part of the Travelling Wilburys, is among those to tweet its congratulations. Simply Red's Mick Hucknall said he was the \"greatest living poet\", while Eurythmics' Dave Stewart welcomed the news by saying: \"I love this.\" Writer Sir Salman Rushdie also praised Dylan's win, saying: \"From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice.\" But Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh voiced his displeasure on Twitter, saying: \"I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.\" US novelist Jodi Picoult also conveyed ambivalence, accompanying a message saying she was \"happy\" for Dylan with the Twitter hashtag \"#ButDoesThisMeanICanWinAGrammy?\" The award will be presented alongside this year's other five Nobel Prizes on 10 December, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's 1896 death. The award announcement came on the same day that the death of Italian playwright Dario Fo - winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997 - was announced.

He and Alfred Yekatom are accused of co-ordinating attacks against the country's Muslim population in 2013-14. Violence continues to grip CAR, two-thirds of which is in rebel hands. The former French colony was plunged into turmoil in 2013 when predominately Muslim rebels from the Séléka group seized power in the majority Christian country. A band of mostly Christian militias, called the anti-Balaka, rose up to counter Séléka after then-President François Bozizé was ousted. Although Mr Bozizé is not on trial, the prosecution alleged that after he was ousted in March 2013, he and his inner circle started \"organising their resistance\" from neighbouring Cameroon \"to ensure his return to power at whatever cost\". Mr Bozizé, who returned to CAR in 2019, has not yet commented on the allegation. What is the case against the accused? The pair are accused of numerous crimes, including murder, torture, and the enlisting of children as soldiers. The prosecution set out the alleged system of command, saying Mr Ngaïssona provided funds and instructions to anti-Balaka groups in 2013 and 2014. Mr Yekatom, nicknamed Rambo, was a commander who allegedly led fighters into Bangui on 5 December 2013 where civilians were slaughtered. The prosecution said the pair's strategy was to make all Muslims their target, not just Séléka combatants, as so-called \"enemies of the nation\". Mr Yekatom authorised his fighters to attack Muslim civilians, including to slit throats, cut off ears and bury people alive, the prosecution alleged. Asked to enter a plea at the start of the trial, both men replied that they reject all the charges. Media reports at the time indicates at least 1,000 people were killed in tit-for-tat clashes in Bangui in December 2013, and half the city's population fled in that month alone. Who is Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona? He was the self-declared political co-ordinator of anti-Balaka forces. Mr Ngaïssona was barred from running for CAR president in 2015 because of his alleged role in the atrocities. He is a former head of the CAR's football federation and briefly served as sports minister before being elected to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) in February 2018. His appointment was criticised by several human rights groups. \"If the allegations were true, I wouldn't be here today,\" he told AFP news agency at the time. \"[I don't] mix politics and sport - everything I've done has been for the good of my country.\" French authorities arrested him in December 2018 and he was transferred to the ICC in January 2019. Who is Alfred Yekatom? Mr Yekatom was elected as an MP in 2016, despite being subject to UN sanctions. He was arrested in October 2018 after he fired a gun in parliament, then ran away, after a row with a fellow MP. His extradition to the ICC was the first from CAR. The International Federation for Human Rights (known by its French acronym FIDH) said it signalled the authorities there were committed to fighting impunity. What's happening in CAR now? Violence continues to beset CAR despite the arrest of the two former prominent militia leaders. Mr Bozizé is also accused of being behind the latest crisis in the mineral-rich country after the constitutional court blocked him from running in the December election. A coalition of rebels - reportedly allied to him - have taken vast swathes of the country and threaten to enter the capital Bangui. Mr Bozizé has denied he has links with the fighters, who refuse to accept President Faustin-Archange Touadéra won an election they boycotted. They want a rerun. At least 12,000 UN peacekeepers backed by Rwandan, Russian and French soldiers are supporting government forces but their presence has not stopped thousands of civilians from fleeing the country. At the start of February, the CAR government extended a state of emergency. The UN refugee agency said in January about 92,000 refugees had fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and more than 13,000 had crossed into Cameroon, Chad and Congo-Brazzaville. It said the rest were displaced within the CAR.

The remains are strewn around and beneath the ice at the \"lake of skeletons\", discovered by a patrolling British forest ranger in 1942. Depending on the season and weather, the lake, which remains frozen for most of the year, expands and shrinks. Only when the snow melts are the skeletons visible, sometimes with flesh attached and well preserved. To date, the skeletal remains of an estimated 600-800 people have been found here. In tourism promotions, the local government describes it as a \"mystery lake\". For more than half-a-century anthropologists and scientists have studied the remains and puzzled over a host of questions. Who were these people? When did they die? How did they die? Where did they come from? One old theory associates the remains to an Indian king, his wife and their attendants, all of whom perished in a blizzard some 870 years ago. Another suggests that some of the remains are of Indian soldiers who tried to invade Tibet in 1841, and were beaten back. More than 70 of them were then forced to find their way home over the Himalayas and died on the way. Yet another assumes that this could have been a \"cemetery\" where victims of an epidemic were buried. In villages in the area, there's a popular folk song that talks about how Goddess Nanda Devi created a hail storm \"as hard as iron\" which killed people winding their way past the lake. India's second-highest mountain, Nanda Devi, is revered as a goddess. Earlier studies of skeletons have found that most of the people who died were tall - \"more than average stature\". Most of them were middle-aged adults, aged between 35 and 40. There were no babies or children. Some of them were elderly women. All were of reasonably good health. Also, it was generally assumed that the skeletons were of a single group of people who died all at once in a single catastrophic incident during the 9th Century. The latest five-year-long study, involving 28 co-authors from 16 institutions based in India, US and Germany, found all these assumptions may not be true. Scientists genetically analysed and carbon-dated the remains of 38 bodies, including 15 women, found at the lake - some of them date back to around 1,200 years. They found that the dead were both genetically diverse and their deaths were separated in time by as much as 1,000 years. \"It upends any explanations that involved a single catastrophic event that lead to their deaths,\" Eadaoin Harney, the lead author of the study, and a doctoral student at Harvard University, told me. \"It is still not clear what happened at Roopkund Lake, but we can now be certain that the deaths of these individuals cannot be explained by a single event.\" But more interestingly, the genetics study found the dead comprised a diverse people: one group of people had genetics similar to present-day people who live in South Asia, while the other \"closely related\" to people living in present-day Europe, particularly those living in the Greek island of Crete. Also, the people who came from South Asia \"do not appear to come from the same population\". \"Some of them have ancestry that would be more common in groups from the north of the subcontinent, while others have ancestry that would be more common from more southern groups,\" says Ms Harney. So did these diverse groups of people travel to the lake in smaller batches over a period of a few hundred years? Did some of them die during a single event? No arms or weapons or trade goods were found at the site - the lake is not located on a trade route. Genetic studies found no evidence of the presence of any ancient bacterial pathogen that could provide disease as an explanation for the cause of deaths. A pilgrimage that passes by the lake might explain why people were travelling in the area. Studies reveal that credible accounts of pilgrimage in the area do not appear until the late 19th Century, but inscriptions in local temples date between 8th and 10th Centuries, \"suggesting potential earlier origins\". So scientists believe that some of the bodies found at the site happened because of a \"mass death during a pilgrimage event\". But how did people from the eastern Mediterranean land up at a remote lake in India's highest mountains? It seems unlikely that people from Europe would have travelled all the way from Roopkund to participate in a Hindu pilgrimage. Or was it a genetically isolated population of people from distant eastern Mediterranean ancestry that had been living in the region for many generations? \"We are still searching for answers,\" says Ms Harney.

President Muhammadu Buhari announced the disbandment of the agency this week after thousands of Nigerians took to the streets to protest against police brutality. A new agency called Swat has been formed to take over duties performed by Sars but this has also been rejected by the protesters. The demonstrators have been using the hashtag #EndSars to push for their cause, which has since been endorsed by global celebrities such as Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, US rapper Kanye West, gospel singer Kirk Franklin, footballers Mesut Ozil and Marcus Rashford and Nigerian superstars Davido and Wizkid. On Friday, Twitter launched a clenched fist emoji in a show of support for the protests. What else did Mr Kwajafa say? Mr Kwajafa said that the changes might be undermined if there's no \"change in mentality\". He added that the code of conduct that he set up when creating Sars had ensured that there was \"no incident with members of the public\" when he was in charge. The former police boss accused the agency of \"brutality\" saying that the officer's acts could have been driven by \"greed.\" \"I always tell my wife that I was sad [that] what I created with good purpose and direction has been turned into banditry,\" Mr Kwajafa said, adding that he supported the disbandment of the unit \"100%\". What is the government doing? On Thursday, the Nigerian military issued a warning to \"subversive elements and trouble makers\" , who, it says, had taken advantage of the protests about police brutality. The government has since banned protests in the capital Abuja, citing public safety measures to tackle Covid-19. Human Rights Watch has however urged the authorities to respect the right to peaceful protest. The US-based rights group also condemned the initial deadly police crackdown on the protesters which Amnesty International said left 10 people dead and hundreds injured. The governor of Lagos state has said that police officers who allegedly opened fire on protesters there have been arrested and are being tried. But the demonstrators appear unsatisfied, the BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports from Abuja. As a way of meeting some of the demands of the protesters, the federal government has announced the establishment of judicial panels to investigate past and new police misconduct in all 36 states.

He is known to have previously published books on the personal lives of Chinese Communist Party members. Rights groups condemned the \"harsh sentence\" and called for his release. He was one of five owners of a small bookstore in Hong Kong who went missing in 2015. It later emerged that they had been taken to China. Four were later freed, but Mr Gui remained in Chinese detention. In delivering its verdict, the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court said that his Chinese citizenship had been reinstated in 2018. China does not recognise dual citizenship. Sweden's foreign minister on Tuesday called for Mr Gui's release, referring to him a \"citizen\". \"We have not had access to the trial,\" said Ann Linde in a tweet. \"[We] demand that Gui be released and that we have access to our citizens to provide consular support.\" But according to a Reuters report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said consular arrangements had been put on hold because of the latest coronavirus outbreak, and would be restored once the health problem was \"resolved\". Zhao Lijian added that Mr Gui's \"rights and interests... [had] been fully guaranteed\". Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday also called for Mr Gui to be released immediately and said the charges were \"completely unsubstantiated\". A forced confession? Mr Gui first made headlines in 2015 when he vanished from Thailand and resurfaced in China. After his disappearance, there were allegations that he had been abducted by Chinese agents. Chinese officials, however, say Mr Gui and the four other men all went to China voluntarily. The bookseller ultimately confessed to being involved in a fatal traffic accident more than a decade earlier - a confession supporters say was forced. He served two years in prison but he was arrested months after his release while he was travelling to the Chinese capital of Beijing with two Swedish diplomats. China later released a video interview featuring Mr Gui. In it, he accused Sweden of \"sensationalising\" his case. It is not uncommon for Chinese criminal suspects to appear in \"confessional\" videos. Earlier in 2019, Sweden recalled its ambassador to China Anna Lindstedt, who was accused of brokering an unauthorised meeting between Angela Gui - the daughter of Mr Gui - and two Chinese businessmen. Ms Gui - who has been vocal in campaigning for her father's release - said one of the men had pressured her to accept a deal where her father would go to trial and might be sentenced to \"a few years\" in prison, and in return she would stop all publicity around her father's detention.", "summary": "Un jeune Chinois a été condamné à 10 ans de prison ferme pour prison pour \"commerce illicite d'armes à feu\" parce qu'il avait vendu des armes factices qui tirent des balles en caoutchouc."}

On the chalkboard, maths equations have been replaced by a vaccination schedule. Joseph Maina, who owns the central Kenyan school, has had to turn to nurturing animals to earn some money as he is no longer getting an income from providing an education. 'Vital for survival' Things were especially tough in March, when all the schools were told to close, as he was still repaying a loan and had to renegotiate with the bank. At first, it seemed that everything was lost, but \"we decided that we must do something [with the school] for survival\", Mr Maina tells the BBC. As private schools, which educate around a fifth of Kenyan children, rely on fees for their income, their enforced closure has meant that they cannot pay the staff and many are in serious financial trouble. A small number of schools have managed to continue teaching through online learning, but the fees they are getting barely cover teachers' basic living expenses, according to the Kenya Private Schools Association (KPSA). About 95% of the more than 300,000 private-school staff members have been sent on unpaid leave, KPSA chief executive Peter Ndoro says. In addition, 133 schools have been forced to close permanently. 'Never this bad' In order to avoid taking this drastic measure, Roka Preparatory, another school in central Kenya, has also converted its premises into a farm. \"Things have never been this bad,\" James Kung'u, who founded the school 23 years ago, tells the BBC. Outside, vegetables are now growing in what was the playground. He is also rearing chickens. \"My situation is similar to other schools. I struggle to fuel the car. The teachers and the students are no longer here. Psychologically, we are very much affected,\" Mr Kung'u says. Both Mwea Brethren and Roka have retained only two employees, who are helping with the farm work. \"It is not for riches. We are comfortable… at least you are not bored, you are busy and it's like therapy,\" says Mr Kung'u. No role for teachers While the two schools have found an alternative source of income, the owners worry about the fate of their teachers, who have had to go without pay for five months. This is in contrast to staff at state-run schools, who have been receiving their salaries. Mr Maina says some teachers in his school have called him to ask if there is anything they can do. \"But unfortunately we don't even have enough to feed ourselves,\" he says. As a consequence, many have turned to alternative professions. Macrine Otieno, who taught for six years at a private school in the capital, Nairobi, was evicted from her house after she was unable to pay her rent. She took a job as a live-in nanny to be able to get shelter and food. \"Since we had our first case of coronavirus in Kenya, and the schools were closed, there has been nothing for me to do. \"I have been trying to hustle a bit to find something for my child, but it has not been easy,\" she tells the BBC.

She hopes her business will do well and does not plan to go back to teach even when the schools reopen. Her idea is not uncommon and furthermore there is a question mark over whether the private schools will be able to reopen, as adapting to coronavirus could impose extra costs. KPSA wants the government to help resolve the financial problem through grants totalling $65m (£50m). It is also hoping that the teachers stay in the profession. \"There is need for the government to support private schools because they contribute so significantly to the economy and actually reduce the expenditure of the government on education,\" Mr Ndoro says. If the money is not forthcoming \"some of the schools may not be able to survive\", he warns. The ministry has offered help through a concessionary loan that will be available to those establishments that qualify but Mr Ndoro fears it won't be enough to save all the country's schools.", "summary": "La décision du Kenya de fermer toutes les écoles jusqu'en janvier prochain à cause du coronavirus a laissé beaucoup de ses écoles privées lutter pour survivre selon Basillioh Mutahi et Mercy Juma."}

He passed away on the same date that his great friend Hugh Masekela had died three years earlier, and two years to the day after Zimbabwean great Oliver Mtukudzi. Gwangwa, who spent the prime of his life in exile, not only won acclaim for his music, he was also deeply involved in the struggle against white-minority rule in the country. Born in the Johannesburg township of Soweto on 19 October 1937, Gwangwa went on to enjoy a highly successful musical career spanning six decades. During that time he answered the call by Oliver Tambo, then-president of the ANC, to lead the Amandla Cultural Ensemble. The group was formed in 1980 to show a softer side to the anti-apartheid struggle, and win support in different parts of the world. The white-minority National Party government regarded Gwangwa's musical and cultural activism as a big enough threat for their security forces to bomb his house in Botswana in 1985. Fortunately the musician and the other occupants were elsewhere. His commitment to the liberation struggle together with his exceptional musical talent saw Gwangwa being awarded South Africa's Order of Ikhamanga in Gold - the nation's highest honour. The citation for the national order, which he received in 2010, recalls how he \"enthralled the world with his artistry as a composer and all-round creative genius. For more than 30 years he travelled the world as an exile collecting accolades wherever he went\". 'A mirror for society' Paying tribute to Jonas Gwangwa, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that he \"ascends to our great orchestra of musical ancestors, whose creative genius and dedication to the freedom of all South Africans inspired millions in our country - and mobilised the international community against the apartheid system\". Former president Thabo Mbeki paid his own tribute via his foundation: \"Bra JG, as he was affectionately known, understood the potent combination of culture and the arts as an effective instrument for national liberation from the beginning of his career. \"Together with others of his generation, Gwangwa harnessed the enthralling capacity of music not just to entertain, but also to hold up the mirror to society and bare the evil soul of the Apartheid regime to the world.\" A young Gwangwa delighted audiences in Johannesburg's vibrant multi-racial cultural hub of Sophiatown, until it became illegal for black people to congregate and the apartheid government censored jazz performances in 1960. Along with other leading South African musicians like Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim and Miriam Makeba, Gwangwa went into exile rather than bow to apartheid censorship. He rose to worldwide prominence in 1965 performing at a Sound of Africa concert at New York's Carnegie Hall with the likes of Makeba, Masekela, and Letta Mbulu. It was the start of an international career that he used in service of the constantly growing struggle against white-minority rule. In 1987, alongside English composer George Fenton, Gwangwa composed the score for the film Cry Freedom, earning two Oscar nominations for best original score and song. He also received numerous awards at home, including at the South African Music Awards in the jazz category. 'Boy, did he play the trombone' Like most other exiles Gwangwa returned home in the 1990s. Ike Phaahla, one of the country's leading radio jazz presenters, remembers the musician's first performance back home - at the famous Kippies jazz club in Johannesburg in 1991. \"Backstage he regaled us with stories from his time in exile, but boy did he play the trombone that night. \"He was not only an artist but also an activist and freedom fighter. He was insightful but very humble. He always enjoyed the stage and had lots of fun with his band,\" said Phaahla. Despite being out of the country, internationally renowned artists like Gwangwa had a huge impact on those at home, including saxophonist Khaya Mahlangu. \"He was one of the pioneers alongside Abdullah Ibrahim, Caiphus Semenya and Hugh Masekela,\" Mahlangu said. \"They were the trailblazers, guys who hoisted our cultural flag high up on the international stage, and they shaped the cumulative me because much as they spent so much time abroad, they kept the sound of South Africa alive.\" He was honoured with a special provincial state funeral on Friday livestreamed online by South Africa's state broadcaster, bringing together those kept apart by coronavirus restrictions. Gwangwa's death, just two weeks after that of his wife Violet, is a huge loss to South Africa's music fraternity. But at least the world will still be able to tap their feet and lift their spirits when listening to his music.

We were surprised because it is a triangle that we often see in documentaries about freemasons or illuminati,\" local resident Serge Ifulu is quoted by Reuters as saying. Speculation over the pillar, which appeared in the Bandal neighbourhood over the weekend, became frenzied by Wednesday. Witnesses say residents destroyed it to see what was inside - it turned out to be hollow with the metal sheets spread over a frame. Local mayor Bayllon Gaibene told the BBC that he had now sent some of the material to be tested by scientists to find out about its origins. He denied an accusation by Kinshasa's Governor Gentiny Ngobila that he was responsible for the mysterious monolith. Mr Ngobila's spokesman had said the mayor had wanted to create a buzz. It is not the first such metal object to have created a stir of late, especially with science fiction fans. Tourists rushed to see a metal monolith which appeared in Utah, in the US, in November. An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist took credit for it, offering it for sale for $45,000 (£34,000). Several have appeared in the UK, including one on the Isle of Wight in December. That time artist Tom Dunford said he had erected the structure for \"fun\". One that turned up earlier this month near Turkey's Gobekli Tepe, an ancient temple and World Heritage Site, transpired to be a stunt by the government to promote its new space programme.

Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%. The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, \"causing many deaths - mostly among young children\", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage. In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018. The UN says the disease is \"entirely preventable\" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has \"stalled\" at 85%, \"still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks\". In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said the world was \"in the middle of a measles crisis\" and that \"the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information\" about vaccines was partly to blame. Why the sudden 'global measles crisis'? By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News It is one of the most contagious viruses around. However, nothing about measles has changed. It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous. Instead the answers are entirely human. There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation. In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus. This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar. But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too. This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media. It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher. And that measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year. The pair wrote that it was \"understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost\" but that \"ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines\". They added: \"More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone.\" In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory. Last month, Italy banned children under six from attending schools unless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses.

Within half an hour of the result about 2,000 fans had gathered outside the club's stadium, with some celebrating outside the famous Kop stand. No attempts were made to disperse the crowd by police officers at the ground. Merseyside Police closed roads around Anfield at 23:00 BST and advised motorists to avoid the area. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden said \"a large number of people chose to gather outside the stadium\" but said it was mostly \"good natured\". He praised the \"overwhelming majority\" of fans that \"recognised now is not the time to gather together to celebrate, and chose to mark the event safely\". It is Liverpool's 19th top-flight title and their first since 1989-90, when Sir Kenny Dalglish led them to victory. Jurgen Klopp's side needed one victory to seal the league but City's failure to win means they cannot be caught. A number of Reds players, including goalkeeper Alisson, defender Virgil van Dijk and midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, celebrated together after watching the Chelsea-City game. Thousands more fans gathered outside the club's famous Kop stand throughout the night, with some climbing on walls, bins and the roof of a merchandise stand. Supporters danced, set off flares and waved flags while singing the name of Liverpool players including Mo Salah and captain Jordan Henderson. Many fans were seen hugging and one man stood with his arm around a cardboard cut-out of manager Jurgen Klopp. As well as gathering at Anfield, fans also filled Liverpool city centre where they joined together to sing the club's famous anthem You'll Never Walk Alone. Many of the fans that congregated wore face masks and cars also gathered outside Anfield, with some beeping horns as they passed. Six-year-old Anthony Nesbitt went to the ground with his father Anthony and mother Marilyn, as well as a cardboard cut-out of Liverpool star Sadio Mane. \"This is amazing, especially for them. We've been waiting 30 years for it,\" Ms Nesbitt said. An emotional Charlie Cooper, 48, who watched it at his home in Halewood, said he remembered the last time Liverpool won the league. \"To finally do it is a relief more than anything,\" he told the BBC's Nick Garnett. Another ecstatic fan David Taylor, 65, added: \"It is amazing. We've done it now.\" He said he was \"more delighted\" for the younger generation, like his granddaughter who had never seen the club lift a league title. Earlier on Thursday, fans were urged by the city's metro mayor Steve Rotheram to be the \"best 'stay at home' fans in the world\" to prevent the spread of coronavirus. As fans began gathering in the city, Liverpool City Council told them to \"have a great party\" but maintain social distancing as they celebrated. The club's CEO Peter Moore tweeted a picture of Liverpool fan Sean Cox, who sustained serious brain injuries in an attack by Roma supporters outside Anfield in 2018.

Felix Tshisekedi's father founded the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (known by its French initials UDPS) in 1982, and was a feared rival of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who died months after being ousted in 1997, and later of Presidents Laurent and Joseph Kabila. Under his leadership, the UDPS became the country's largest opposition party, but he never succeeded in winning office. His legal challenge to the official results of the 2011 presidential election, which showed he won 32% of the vote to Joseph Kabila's 49%, failed. The veteran opposition leader died in 2017 leaving a big question over who would succeed him. 'No free pass' His former chief of staff Albert Moleka told the BBC that his son was not necessarily the obvious choice: \"Etienne Tshisekedi was very vocal about his scepticism towards his son's abilities. He was very demanding of his son. \"He was someone who fought for the people and so he wasn't going to give his son a free pass.\" Mr Moleka said it was the presidential hopeful's mother, Marthe Kasalu, who pushed for the son to become the leader. In March last year, he was voted in as the party's new head and became its de facto candidate for the presidential elections. But Mr Tshisekedi did not simply cash in on his name. He has been immersed in politics from a very young age, and had to work his way through the party. He also had to suffer the consequences of his father's political activism. When the UDPS was created, the Tshisekedi family was forced into internal exile to their home town in the central Kasai province. They stayed there until 1985, when President Mobutu allowed the mother and children to leave. His own man Felix Tshisekedi then went to the Belgian capital, Brussels. After completing his studies there he took up politics, working his way through his father's party to become national secretary for external affairs for the UDPS, based in Brussels. \"He made powerful friends and allies among the diaspora there, but he was sometimes overlooked - and so it wasn't easy for him,\" said Mr Moleka. \"Felix has always shown a lot of willingness. He's courageous but his problem is that he needs to figure out what his ultimate goal is.\" 'Perpetuating father's dream' The swearing in of Mr Tshisekedi saw the first peaceful transition of power in DR Congo since independence in 1960. He told the crowds at his inauguration that he wanted to \"build a strong Congo, turned toward development in peace and security - a Congo for all in which everyone has a place\". By becoming president, Mr Tshisekedi went one step further than his father, but speaking before the election he said he was not in competition with him. \"I don't have any ambition to rival my father. He is my master, and you don't rival the master. \"But I'm going to try my best to perpetuate his dream, his dream of a country of rule of law, of a better Congo, where our sons and daughters can flourish, that's what I am pursuing.\" Mr Tshisekedi has said he will make the fight against poverty a \"great national cause\". He aims, for example, to increase the average per person income to $11.75 (£9.30) a day, compared to $1.25 today. \"It's really the minimum we can do I think, and the minimum people expect from us,\" the candidate earlier told the BBC in an interview in the capital, Kinshasa. He says his programme can be accomplished over two presidential terms - a period of 10 years - and will cost an estimated $86bn. 'Revenge' Mr Moleka also detected another force motivating the UDPS leader. \"The Tshisekedis had a difficult life and so for Felix Tshisekedi, these elections are a bit of a revenge, for his family,\" he said. When presenting his programme during a press conference, the candidate was pressed about his lack of experience. Why DR Congo matters: \"It's true I don't have experience in bad governance or in the pillaging of my country,\" he responded, \"but I do have experience in the respect of human rights and civil liberties.\" In the months prior to the vote, opposition parties in the DR Congo - including the UDPS - had said that they would pick a joint candidate for the election to increase their chances of defeating the governing party. But after the opposition parties made the decision to pick Martin Fayulu as the unity candidate, Mr Tshisekedi backed out and decided to run. He was supported by Union for the Congolese Nation leader Vital Kamerhe - his running mate. Although Mr Tshisekedi argued he was simply following the wishes of the party base, many in the country criticised his decision not to support Mr Fayulu. Disputed result The electoral commission said Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote on 30 December, compared to 34.7% for Martin Fayulu, another opposition figure. Ruling coalition candidate Emmanuel Shadary took 23.8%. But doubts were raised about the results include by the country's influential Catholic Church, international experts based in the US, and the French and German governments. Mr Fayulu accused Mr Tshisekedi of coming to a power-sharing arrangement with the outgoing president. He denied the accusation. The African Union also expressed doubts about the result, but later accepted Mr Tshisekedi's victory.", "summary": "Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo a été déclaré vainqueur de la présidentielle en République démocratique du Congo, selon les résultats provisoires.

The Leeds University-led research found that organic yoghurts were among the most sugary types - containing more sugar per 100g than cola. Only natural and Greek-style yoghurts could be classed as low in sugar. The study - published in BMJ Open - comes as government health officials are encouraging manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the public. Yoghurts have been identified as one of the food types on which Public Health England wants to see progress. This research was undertaken shortly after the launch of the sugar-reduction programme. Unsurprisingly, yoghurt desserts contained the most sugar - an average of 16.4g per 100g. This category also included some products that did not contain yoghurt, such as chocolate mousse and creme caramel. The second most sugary product was organic yoghurts with a typical 13.1g per 100g. Children's yoghurts typically contained 10.8g per 100g, the equivalent of more than two sugar cubes, the study found. By comparison a 100g serving of a typical cola contains 9g of sugar. The NHS recommends that children aged four to six have no more than 19g of sugar, or five sugar cubes a day, and it is advised that those aged seven to 10 consume less than 24g daily. To be classed as low sugar there needs to be no more than 5g per 100g. Only 9% of products surveyed were below this threshold. How much sugar was in the yoghurt? Desserts - 16.4g per 100g Organic - 13.1g per 100g Flavoured - 12g per 100g Fruit - 11.9g per 100g Children's - 10.8g per 100g Dairy alternatives - 9.2g per 100g Drinks - 9.1g per 100g Natural and Greek - 5g per 100g Since the fieldwork for the study was carried out - at the end of 2016 - progress has been made on reducing sugar consumption from yoghurts. A report published in May showed sugar content in yoghurts had been reduced by 6% in the first year, making it the only food category to exceed the 5% target. By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed \"positive steps\" were being made. But Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: \"Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar. \"I think people, including parents, will be surprised to know just how much sugar there is in yoghurt. \"My advice would be to buy natural yoghurt and mix in your own fruit.\" Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter", "summary": "De nombreux yaourts sont pleins de sucre et les consommateurs ne devraient pas avoir l'impression de manger des produits sains, affirment les chercheurs."}

The move has sparked international condemnation. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the \"medieval punishments\". \"You wake up and realise that your neighbours, your family or even that nice old lady that sells prawn fritters by the side of the road doesn't think you're human, or is okay with stoning,\" one Bruneian gay man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. The sultan of the small South-East Asian nation on Wednesday called for \"stronger\" Islamic teachings. \"I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,\" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a public address, according to AFP news agency, without mentioning the strict new interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. Brunei has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. What is punishable under the changes to the penal code? The law mostly applies to Muslims, including children who have reached puberty, though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims. Under the new laws, individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present. Individuals who have not reached puberty but are convicted of certain offences may be instead subjected to whipping. What has global reaction been? Sultan Hassanal heads the Brunei Investment Agency which owns the Dorchester Collection, an operator of some of the world's top hotels including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic Malay residents enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. But Hollywood actor George Clooney and other celebrities have now called for a boycott of the luxury hotels. TV host Ellen DeGeneres also called for people to \"rise up\", saying \"we need to do something now\". The hotel operator said it did \"not tolerate any form of discrimination\". \"Dorchester Collection's code emphasises equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees,\" it said. \"Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs.\" In another development, a honorary degree awarded by the UK's University of Aberdeen to Sultan Hassanal is under review. Is this the first time Islamic law is being introduced in Brunei? The country first introduced Sharia law in 2014 despite widespread condemnation, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The sultan had said then that the new penal code would come into full force over several years. The first phase, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. Brunei had delayed introducing the final two phases, which cover crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. But on Saturday, the government released a statement on its website saying the Sharia penal code would be fully implemented on Wednesday. In the days since, there has been international outrage and calls for the country to reverse course. \"These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago,\" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. \"Brunei's penal code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights.\" The United Nations echoed the statement, calling the legislation \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\", and saying it marked a \"serious setback\" for human rights protection. According to rights group Human Rights Without Frontiers, stoning is still a punishment in countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan among others. Why is this being implemented now? There are several theories, but Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project, said it could be linked to Brunei's weakening economy. \"One theory is that it is a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power in the face of a declining economy that could potentially lead to some unrest in future,\" Mr Woolfe told the BBC. \"Connected to this is [Brunei's] interest in attracting more investment from the Muslim world, along with more Islamic tourists… this could be seen as one way of appealing to this market.\" Mr Woolfe also added that the government might have hoped to get away with the latest roll-out without anyone realising. \"I think that the government did want to ensure that the international uproar that followed implementation of the first phase in 2014 had well and truly died down before further [implementation], in the hope it would just quietly [do so] without anyone realising,\" he said. \"It wasn't until increasing international attention that it finally came out and confirmed [this].\" The penal code changes were posted on the attorney general's website in December but only came to public attention in late March. There was no public announcement. How are people in Brunei reacting? One 40-year-old gay Bruneian currently seeking asylum in Canada said the impact of the new penal code was already being felt in Brunei. The ex-government employee, who left Brunei last year after being charged with sedition for a Facebook post that was critical of the government, said people were \"afraid\". \"The gay community in Brunei has never been open but when Grindr [a gay dating app] came that helped people meet in secret. But now, what I've heard is that hardly anyone is using Grindr anymore,\" Shahiran S Shahrani Md told the BBC. \"They're afraid that they might talk to a police officer pretending to be gay. It hasn't happened yet but because of the new laws, people are afraid,\" he said. Another male Bruneian, who is not gay but has renounced Islam, said he felt \"fearful and numb\" in the face of the laws being implemented. \"We ordinary citizens are powerless to stop Sharia law from being implemented,\" said the 23-year-old, who did not want to be identified. \"Under Sharia, I would face the death penalty for apostasy.\" One gay man was hopeful that the laws might not be enforced widely. \"Honestly, I'm not too scared as the government here often bluffs with the harsh punishments. But it can and will still happen even with it being rare.\" Will the new laws be applied? It is very unlikely to happen at all, people inside Brunei have told Bill Hayton, associate fellow with the Asia Pacific programme at Chatham House. \"What I'm hearing from people in Brunei is that this is very, very unlikely to ever happen,\" he told BBC Radio Four. For instance, the laws stipulate that there must be four Muslim witnesses to the act of anal sex or adultery for it to be prosecuted, he said. \"The way it is being explained to me is that this is a way for the sultan to look religious but make sure that none of these punishments will actually be carried out,\" Mr Hayton said.", "summary": "Brunei doit introduire ce mercredi une nouvelle législation inspirée de la charia, avec la lapidation pour l'homosexualité et l'adultère."}

In January alone, at least 60 people were killed in four separate attacks in the north of the country, with another 20 killed on Sunday. Members of parliament recently unanimously voted in favour of arming civilians in a move they said would help combat the armed groups. It is due to be signed into law. The attacks by militants linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have significantly increased in the past year, causing more than half a million people to flee their homes. Critics have questioned whether the new measure will make people safer, but the government insists that armed volunteers are necessary to stem the spread of violence. Why get civilians involved? The law says that the army's capacity to fight the militants is limited in terms of numbers of soldiers and lack of appropriate training. \"In light of the persistent threat, populations have... expressed their desire to actively engage in the defence of the homeland,\" it states. But this is not proof of the army's weakness, the government insisted. Speaking to the BBC, Communication Minister Remi Dandjinou likened the future volunteers to members of the French resistance during Germany's occupation of France in the World War Two. But there is a concern that the new measures could heighten ethnic conflict and fuel tensions between rival hunting and farming communities. \"The Burkinabe security forces are themselves implicated in very serious abuses against suspects,\" Corinne Dufka from Human Rights Watch told the BBC. \"That is why subcontracting any defence responsibilities to armed civilians is so potentially problematic.\" \"It could exacerbate rising communal tensions and lead to more abuses, which would in turn push more people into the hands of the jihadists.\" Burkina Faso's government has previously denied claims of widespread abuse. Who will be armed? Any national aged 18 and over can be considered for recruitment and there is no maximum age. But recruits cannot be part of any political group or party. Volunteers must be patriotic and loyal and have a \"spirit of sacrifice\" which could include making the \"ultimate sacrifice\", according to the law that the MPs backed. But, after it was passed, Defence Minister Cheriff Sy insisted recruits would not be used as \"cannon fodder\". Recruitment will be carried out at a local level at an assembly where village leaders will be supervised by the army. But the volunteers will not be a route to legitimising self-defence groups, made up of people who are sometimes referred to as vigilantes. In Burkina Faso, as in Mali and Nigeria, civilians have armed themselves to defend their homes, and in some cases, gone on the offensive. These self-defence groups are not officially sanctioned by authorities. They are often composed on ethnic lines and have in many cases targeted rival communities. One of the concerns raised is that parts of the country - up to one-third according to some estimates - are believed to be under the control of militant groups, making it far too dangerous and impractical to hand out weapons in those areas. The north and north-eastern border areas with Mali and Niger are the most affected by attacks, but so are increasingly the southern border areas. What training will volunteers get? It is unclear when the recruitment will start and whether people are actually keen to sign up. The law states that at least 10 volunteers should be recruited per village or area of residency. Once they are recruited, the volunteers will undergo 14 days of training, which will include how to handle weapons, basic combat methods, the rules of discipline and civic and moral education. It is unclear who will be providing the training and whether it will be followed up. You may also be interested in : After their induction, the recruits will be given weapons, along with communication and observation equipment. But they will not get uniforms. While volunteers, who are expected to sign up for at least a year, will not be paid, the groups will receive financial support from the state for equipment and other mission-related expenses. They are also allowed to receive donations. They will get medical bills paid if they are injured and compensation if they are left with permanent injuries. Funerals will be paid for if those who die in action. Nationally, the ministry of defence will oversee the work of the civilian force, but locally the village chief will be responsible. What is their mission? Volunteers are expected to be available at all times in their village. They are expected to support the work of the army and police force, to help secure their village or district. This could involve conducting surveillance and providing intelligence to the army but they are forbidden from conduct policing activities. The volunteers will be expected to abide by a code of conduct, which for now has not been made public.", "summary": "Les autorités du Burkina Faso, aux prises avec une vague croissante d'attaques de militants islamistes qui touchent la région, prévoient de donner des armes à des civils, selon la loi \"portant institution de volontaires pour la défense de la patrie\"."}

When, thanks to a $500m Chinese loan, the train line linking Abuja to Kaduna opened in 2016 people used it more for its novelty value, given that most the country's railway system is a relic from the colonial era. Brawling for tickets But now it is hard to get a ticket for the four round-trips made each day, with 5,000 commuters packing on to them daily. The demand is high because nine armed police officers are on board guarding the train's six carriages. A one-way ticket is sold for about $4 for economy and $8 for business class - and there are usually long queues to get them. Many passengers miss scheduled trips because of the huge demand. Many of the civil servants who work in the capital live in Kaduna. In August, users posted images of stranded passengers brawling over tickets at a train station. Officials have also been accused of hoarding tickets and selling them at inflated rates in a racketeering scheme, prompting the government to say it is considering automating the process. Those who have tickets but cannot find seats have the option of standing for the two-hour journey for the same fee.

Others were squeezed into the spaces between the carriages and by the toilets. It is a choice many are happy to make rather than use what has been dubbed Nigeria's most dangerous road. The highway is bordered on each side by thick rows of neem and baobab trees, providing excellent cover for the armed gangs hiding in wait. Kidnappers in Nigeria are not fussy. They abduct both rich and poor, often collecting ransoms of up to $150,000 and as low as $20 - sometimes killing those whose families fail to pay. \"At its height, the road had 10 kidnappings per day with 20 different groups operating on the route,\" says police commander Abba Kyari, who heads a special unit fighting kidnappers. The true figures are likely to be higher, as some families, like that of Mr Addo, choose not to report to officials, deciding to negotiate with the kidnappers directly. Train passenger and postgraduate student Idris Mohammed, who used to travel by road to Kaduna for the weekends, is happy to pay more for his safety as \"the roads are too dangerous now\". Why don't people live in Abuja? For most of the civil servants who work in the capital annual rents as high as $15,000 are just too expensive. Many live to the north in Kaduna, the commercial hub of northern Nigeria, where housing is cheaper. A cosmopolitan city, Kaduna is very different to Abuja, bristling with divergent interests, but with simmering tensions over ethnic, political and religious issues. By contrast, Abuja is a slow-paced, administrative city. It became Nigeria's capital in 1991 and has grown up from a small village to become home to many diplomats and foreign NGO workers. It was chosen as the capital because of its central location - which means that many people come from elsewhere in the country to work there, so on weekends it really empties out. And its fairly well-heeled daily and weekly commuters are prime targets for kidnappers. Bus stations suffering But the popularity of the trains is bad news for buses. Despite buses charging at least six times less than the trains, many of the big bus stations, which used to be bustling with passengers and luggage, are now empty. An official from the transporters' union told me the safety the trains could provide was the main reason. Many of those who still use the road do so in private cars and set off at mid-morning or early afternoon. Those who travel later place their faith in the several police check-points along the road to try to deter kidnappers. Though the police have recorded a few successes against the kidnappers, including the 2017 arrest in south-west Lagos of an alleged kidnap kingpin, some people still question the seriousness of security agencies in tackling the problem. For now the train is a welcome haven - and the only recent security issue has been over cattle. In September last year, the armed police escorts fired live rounds into the air to disperse villagers on the outskirts of Kaduna who had gathered to attack a train after 50 cows were crushed crossing the track. The train journeys have also become a meeting point for Nigeria's rich and poor and they sometimes bring together those from feuding communities - now all fleeing one common enemy, kidnappers. When my train finally arrived at Rigasa station in Kaduna, some passengers raised their arms and murmured a prayer: they had lived to die another day.", "summary": "Pour éviter les célèbres bandes de kidnappeurs nigérians, des milliers de voyageurs prennent chaque jour le train entre la capitale, Abuja, et la ville de Kaduna."}

It is hoped genetic differences could explain why some people with no underlying health conditions can develop severe illness. More than 15,000 scientists from around the world have access to UK Biobank. Prof Rory Collins, principal investigator of the project, said it would be “a goldmine for researchers”. “We could go very quickly into getting some very, very important discoveries,” he said. How do Covid-19 symptoms differ? Some people with coronavirus have no symptoms - and scientists are trying to establish what proportion this is. Others have a mild to moderate disease. But about one in five people has a much more severe illness and an estimated 0.5-1% die. How can UK Biobank help? UK Biobank has blood, urine and saliva samples from 500,000 volunteers whose health has been tracked over the past decade And it has already helped to answer questions about how diseases such as cancer, stroke and dementia develop. Now, information about positive coronavirus tests, as well as hospital and GP data, will be added. Prof Collins said: “We’re looking at the data in UK Biobank to understand the differences between those individuals. “What are the differences in their genetics? Are there differences in the genes related to their immune response? Are there differences in their underlying health? “So it is a uniquely rich set of data - and I think we will transform our understanding of the disease.” For what will scientists be looking? Researchers will be scouring the entire genome, searching for tiny variations in DNA. One area of particular interest is the ACE2 gene, which helps make a receptor that allows the virus to enter and infect cells in airways. What about healthy people who become very ill? In addition to the UK Biobank study, a team led by Prof Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Rockefeller University, in New York, is planning to study people under 50 with no underlying medical conditions who are taken into intensive care units. He told BBC News: “We are recruiting these patients worldwide, almost in every country. “We have sequencing hubs distributed all over the world. \"They collect samples, they sequence the genomes of these patients,and then together we analyse them.” Past research has shown some diseases, including flu and herpes, can make people with genetic variations - or inborn errors of immunity, as Prof Casanova calls them - especially ill. “There are surprising inborn errors of immunity that render human beings specifically vulnerable to one microbe,\" he said. “And this inborn error of immunity can be silent, latent, for decades, until infection by that particular microbe. “What our programme does is to essentially test whether this idea also applies to Covid.” Who else is looking at coronavirus genetics? Prof Andrea Ganna, from the University of Helsinki, in Finland, is leading a major effort to pull together genetic information on coronavirus patients from around the world. “There are long-standing studies, involving hundreds of thousands of people, and other smaller ones collecting data on patients who test positive,\" he said. \"It’s such a huge diversity and there are a lot of countries involved and we will try to centralise it.” In Iceland, for example, Decode Genetics has sequenced the genomes of about half the population. It is now carrying out mass testing for coronavirus. And every time someone tests positive, it then sequences the DNA genetic code of the virus to see how it changes as it spreads. Chief executive Dr Kari Stefansson said: “There is the possibility that the diversity in people’s response to the virus is rooted in the sequence diversity of the virus itself - that we may have many strains of the virus in our community and some of them are more aggressive than others. “The other possibility is that this may be rooted in genetic diversity in a patient. Or it may be a combination of both.” Follow Rebecca on Twitter.", "summary": "Une vaste réserve de d ADN est utilisée pour découvrir pourquoi la gravité des symptômes du coronavirus varie autant d'un malade à un autre."}

Mr Erdogan has not responded to the allegations. Earlier this month, world leaders pledged not to interfere in Libya's civil conflict and vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. Turkey supports the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli while France has nurtured ties with the government's rival, the rebel General Khalifa Haftar. Since April 2019, the GNA has fought back against an offensive launched by fighters loyal to Gen Haftar. Mr Macron said the presence of Turkish warships was \"a clear violation\" of what President Erdogan had pledged in Berlin on 19 January during a conference on Libya with other world leaders. Mr Macron called Turkey's actions \"detrimental to the security of all Europeans and Sahelians\". The Sahel region, a semi-arid stretch of land just south of the Sahara Desert, has been a frontline in the war against Islamist militancy for almost a decade. There are fears that arms from Libya could flood into the Sahel region, where 4,500 French soldiers and more than 14,000 UN peacekeepers are based. What happened in Berlin? Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to end foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Angela Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict, \"only a political solution\". UN Secretary-General António Guterres, meanwhile, said all the major powers present shared \"a strong commitment to stop\" any further escalation in the region. He added, however, that he was \"very worried\" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Haftar had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards that the major powers \"have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue\" between the warring parties. What is happening in Libya? Libya has been torn by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the GNA based in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNA captured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, and attempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. What about the role of foreign powers? The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, with Turkey passing a controversial law to deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli. Gen Haftar's LNA has the backing of Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan. Recently, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salamé told the BBC's Radio 4 Today Programme that a political solution to the conflict was best for all parties involved because Libya - with its vast geography, strong local identities, heavily armed population and weakened government infrastructure - was a difficult country for one group to control.", "summary": "Le président français Emmanuel Macron a accusé son homologue turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan de ne pas avoir tenu sa promesse de rester en dehors de la Libye."}

Low oil price The BBC's Naziru Mikailu in the capital, Abuja, says most commercial banks, especially smaller ones, have suffered as a result of the policy, as government agencies stopped depositing their money with them. Bank customers, especially those who import and export goods, will be affected by the ban as it means they will not be able to access their foreign currency accounts.

Lombardy was the hardest-hit region in the world and medics are struggling to hold it together. Paolo Miranda is an intensive care nurse in Cremona. \"I'm more irritable,\" he says. \"I get angry easily and I pick fights.\" A few weeks ago, Paolo decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. \"I never want to forget what happened to us. It will soon become history,\" he tells me. In his photos, he wants to show how his colleagues are coping with 'Phase 2' as life goes back to normal in Italy. \"Although the emergency is slowing down, we feel surrounded by darkness,\" he says. \"It's like we are full of wounds. We carry everything we've seen inside us.\" Nightmares and night sweats It's a feeling echoed by Monica Mariotti, also an intensive care nurse. \"Things are much harder now than during the crisis,\" she says. \"We had an enemy to fight. Now that I have time to reflect, I feel so lost, aimless.\" During the crisis, they were overwhelmed and had no time to think. But as the strain of the pandemic fades, so does the adrenaline. All the stress accumulated in the past few weeks is coming to the surface. \"I have insomnia and nightmares,\" Monica says. \"I wake up 10 times each night with my heart racing and out of breath.\" Her colleague Elisa Pizzera says she felt strong during the emergency but is now exhausted. She does not have the energy to cook or take care of the house, and when she has a day off she spends most of her time sitting on the couch. No 'new normal' Martina Benedetti is an intensive care nurse in Tuscany and still refuses to see family and friends as she fears she could infect them. \"I even social distance from my husband,\" she says. \"We sleep in separate rooms.\" Even the simple things have become overwhelming. \"Every time I try to go for a walk, I feel anxious and I have to go back home immediately,\" Martina admits. Now that she's finally got time to reflect, she is full of self-doubt. \"I'm not sure I want to be a nurse anymore,\" she tells me. \"I've seen more people die in the past two months than in the whole six years.\" Some 70% of health workers dealing with Covid-19 in Italy's hardest-hit areas are suffering from burnout, a recent study shows. \"This is actually the hardest moment for doctors and nurses,\" says Serena Barello, the author of the study. When we deal with a crisis, our body produces hormones that help us handle stress. \"But when you finally have time to reflect on what happened, and society is moving on, it can all come crushing down and you feel more exhausted and emotionally distressed,\" says Dr Barello. She worries that a lot of doctors and nurses will have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms long after the pandemic. This is when the impact of a traumatic experience affects a person's life, sometimes months or even years later. For health workers, this could impede their ability to keep working with the intensity and focus their jobs require. Forgotten heroes Around the world, frontline doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat patients. But in Italy, this love is ebbing away. \"When they were scared of dying, suddenly we all became heroes but they've already forgotten us,\" says Monica. \"We will go back to being seen as people who wipe asses, lazy and useless.\" In Turin, nurses recently chained themselves together and wore bin bags, a reference to how they had to improvise in wards because of a lack of PPE. They staged a protest to demand recognition for their work. \"In March we were heroes, now we've already been forgotten,\" one nurse shouted through a megaphone. They were promised a bonus for their work but have not yet seen it. No escape At least 163 doctors and 40 nurses died from Covid-19 in Italy. Four of them took their own lives. And yet, many health workers now feel that it's almost as if this pandemic never happened. \"I feel overwhelmed with anger,\" says Elisa Nanino, a doctor who dealt with Covid-19 in care homes. Since the lockdown has been lifted, she constantly sees people drinking and eating together with no face masks and no social distancing. \"I want to go up to them and scream in their face, tell them they're putting everyone in danger,\" she says. \"It's so disrespectful to me and all my colleagues.\" One thing all the health workers agreed on is that public support helped them get through the crisis. \"I'm no hero but it made me feel important,\" Paolo says. Public recognition is the most powerful way we have to help health workers struggling with PTSD, according to Dr Barello's study. \"All of us, we have a crucial role to play right now,\" she says. \"We have to make sure we don't forget what doctors and nurses did for us.\" Soldiers can leave the battlefield and deal with their trauma back home. But for these doctors and nurses, the next 12-hour shift is always around the corner. They have to cope with all of this in the very place where they suffered so much. \"I feel like a soldier that has just returned from war,\" says Paolo. \"Obviously I didn't see weapons or dead bodies in the street but in many ways, I feel like I was in the trenches.\"", "summary": "Dans les pays aux prises avec le coronavirus, les médecins et les infirmières sont salués comme des héros, se battant en première ligne."}

Berzosertib was even more effective when given alongside chemotherapy, the trial run by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden NHS Trust suggested. The trial was designed to test the safety of the drug. The drug is the first to be trialled of a new family of treatments, which block a protein involved in DNA repair. Blocking this protein prevents cancers from mending damage to their cells. It's part of a branch of treatment known as \"precision medicine\", which targets specific genes or genetic changes. The study involved patients with very advanced tumours, for whom no other treatment had worked. This was what is known as a \"phase one\" trial, which is only designed to test the safety of a treatment. But the ICR said the researchers did find some early indications that berzosertib could stop tumours growing. 'Very promising' One of the study's authors, Prof Chris Lord, a professor of cancer genomics at the ICR, said these early signs were \"very promising\", adding that it was unusual in phase one trials to see a clinical response. Further trials will be needed to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness, though. \"This study involved only small numbers of patients...Therefore, it is too early to consider berzosertib a game changer in cancer treatment,\" said Dr Darius Widera at the University of Reading. \"Nevertheless, the unusually strong effects of berzosertib, especially in combination with conventional chemotherapy, give reasons to be optimistic regarding the outcomes of follow-up studies.\" Philip Malling, a 62-year-old who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2012, was enrolled on the trial after two years of unsuccessful chemotherapy. \"I was told 'there's nothing more we can do for you',\" he said. \"In April 2014, I was told 'you'll probably be dead by Christmas'\". He has now been receiving berzosertib treatment for six years, his tumours have shrunk and his condition is stable. \"It means everything,\" Mr Malling told the BBC. Another patient, whose ovarian cancer returned following a different course of treatment, saw her tumours shrink after combination treatment with the drug and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy works by damaging cancer cells' DNA, so using it in conjunction with this new treatment, which stops the cells from repairing themselves, appears to give an even greater benefit. And berzosertib is able to target tumour cells without affecting other healthy cells, Prof Lord said. \"Our new clinical trial is the first to test the safety of a brand-new family of targeted cancer drugs in people, and it's encouraging to see some clinical responses even in at this early stage,\" said Professor Johann de Bono, head of drug development at the ICR and the Royal Marsden. In the future, these drugs could be used to \"boost the effect of treatments like chemotherapy\" and tackle resistance that could develop to other targeted treatments, he added. Whereas the traditional approach to cancer treatment has been to categorise it by tumour site - breast cancer, lung cancer and so on - the precision-medicine approach targets the genetic abnormality in the tumour, regardless of where it is. Precision approaches are already used, for example in prostate cancers to block the effect of the testosterone hormone involved in the tumour's growth. If used alone this could provide a less aggressive option than chemotherapy, which attacks cells indiscriminately. The next phase of trialling berzosertib is already under way.

It helps to make sure you don't lose time and have to look at your notebooks.\" Ms Becker says the process of perfumery has evolved over the years and this is just the next step. \"Up until about 40 years ago, perfumers worked with all the ingredients in front of them and they'd grab the ingredients and write down the amounts and names of ingredients on a piece of paper.\" The 1980s saw the introduction of computers and perfumers would create their concoctions through a system that looked like an Excel spreadsheet, she says. One benefit of Carto is that samples are created instantly, giving them a competitive advantage. \"We can adjust the perfume almost live with the customer,\" says Ms Becker. \"It is a big plus not just because we gain time but there's more intimacy when we connect in front of the tool.\" What has been their customer's reaction? \"We have some early adopters but some say they will never use it,\" she says. \"I think that's totally normal. But it's created a lot of buzz from customers interested to see how they can see creations with it.\" German fragrance house Symrise has gone one step further and teamed up with IBM Research to create an AI called Philyra, named after the Greek goddess of perfume, that actually studies the aromatic formulas and customer data to produce new fragrances. Philyra was taught in a similar way to an apprentice perfumer, who can study for 10 years before making good new scents. Like Carto, Philyra can't actually sniff anything. Instead, families of smells, including florals, orientals and chypre, were coded along with the different requirements of products like shampoos, deodorants and skin lotions. The AI was also taught about how much of each ingredient would be appropriate. Claire Viola, vice president of digital strategy fragrance at Symrise, is the first to agree it hasn't been without flaws. \"It's machine-learning and sometimes the results have been wrong,\" she says. \"It's still a project, the more we test, the more it continues to improve. It constantly needs training. You have to qualify every new material, so it understands the difference between different florals and oriental scents, for example.\" But, she says, the more they invest in training, the more accurate it becomes. \"We taught it to be like a perfumer... the machine never forgets [compared to humans]. The good thing is that the machine comes up with a selection of scents and interesting combinations that you wouldn't have thought of.\" Given that the machine has a database of close to two million aroma formulas - the potential for a wider range of scents and combinations is huge. In 2019 Brazilian cosmetics company O Boticário worked with Symrise to launch the first fragrance using artificial intelligence. More Technology of Business One company is shaking up the sector by giving consumers the opportunity to play with the technology directly. In Breda in the Netherlands, ScenTronix allows customers to create their own personalised scent based on a questionnaire they answer when they walk into its Algorithmic Perfumery shop. After answering questions such as how do you see your role in life and what kind of environment did you go grow up in, the algorithm analyses the data to create unique perfumes for the customer within seven minutes. Customers can buy five samples for €30 ($33; £26). ScenTronix co-founder Frederik Duerinck says he wanted people to be able to wear a perfume that was a reflection of themselves in that current moment. \"The perfume industry is a lot about branding and adapting your identity to it,\" he explains. \"I thought it would be a good idea to completely change the dynamic and and so the perfume becomes about who you are and not about the brand.\" Mr Duerinck agrees there is a major physiological barrier to overcome as people aren't used to paying for a fragrance they're unable to test until it's been produced. However, he says they try to overcome that hurdle by having someone on site to help customers. \"Although I'd say 75% of the time it is spot on, we always have a professional there [to help],\" he says. Margaux Caron, global beauty analyst for colour cosmetics and fragrance at Mintel, believes artificial intelligence is a powerful tool to create fragrances that are original. \"Not only do they [AI tools] identify olfactory white spaces but they also dramatically optimise the speed of fragrance creation for perfumers. \"Technology and science are sometimes pictured and perceived as cold and rational, but the fragrance category is displaying a warm, emotional, human approach to it. The partnership between AI and perfumers is anchored in this philosophy.\" So does the introduction of technology spell the end of the perfumer? Not according to those I spoke to. \"It will never stop the role of the perfumer,\" says Ms Becker. \"The computer will never come up with beautiful ideas. But it can help bring them alive.\" Ms Viola agrees, adding that it's complementary support to their work, allowing them to experiment much more. \"It's not replacing the perfumer,\" she says. \"It's helping them to be better faster and creative and freeing them from boring tasks. It still starts and ends with the perfumer. They're the ones with the intuition, emotion and feeling and guiding the machine to better results.\" For now at least, as Ms Viola says, \"It's a man-machine collaboration.\"", "summary": "Avez-vous besoin d'un humain pour créer un bon parfum ?

Last week, she sparked a feminist backlash as one of 100 prominent women who signed a letter saying men should be \"free to hit on\" women. Some activists said the intervention trivialised sexual violence. The letter signed by French women writers, performers and academics, was published by Le Monde newspaper last Tuesday. It said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations had spiralled out of control. \"I fraternally salute all the victims of these hideous acts who might have felt assaulted by the letter published in Le Monde. It is to them and them alone that I offer my apologies,\" the actress said in a letter published on Sunday on the website of French daily Liberation. Ms Deneuve also said that there was \"nothing in the letter\" to Le Monde that said \"anything good about harassment, otherwise I wouldn't have signed it\". The signatories of the letter decried a new \"puritanism\" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals, and deplored a wave of \"denunciations\", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has \"caused a lot of pain\". What does the open letter say? In the letter, the signatories say: \"Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss. \"Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack.\" According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. \"As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality.\" Who are the signatories? Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them. The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Élisabeth Lévy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor. There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public. What has the response been? The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to \"close the lid\" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of \"pouring scorn\" on victims of sexual violence. On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter. One Twitter user (in French) regretted the inability of women to speak with one voice, saying they had \"failed to agree\". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France. The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #MeToo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women's rights. Is Deneuve prone to weighing in on such issues? She is not known as an activist star. However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women. Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc (\"rat on your dirty old man\") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.", "summary": "Un collectif de femmes, dont l'actrice française Catherine Deneuve, a publié une tribune dans le quotidien français Le Monde pour dénoncer le \"puritanisme\" et la \"campagne de délations\" depuis l'affaire Weinstein et les scandales de harcèlement sexuel."}

At least 83 people have now been killed in Gaza and seven in Israel. The BBC has spoken to two mothers - one Palestinian, one Jewish Israeli - who have been caught up in the worst fighting the region has experienced in years. 'It's not easy to hide your fears' As hundreds of Israeli missiles hit Gaza on Wednesday night, Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad's family sheltered together in the middle of their first-floor home. The fear the next bomb might hit their home was terrifying beyond words, Najwa says. \"You might in any second be in a bombardment around you, targeting your house or targeting your neighbourhood,\" she says. \"This may change the place where you are supposed to be safe into a grave for you and your children, for your dreams, for your memories, for everything.\" Najwa lives with her husband and five children, aged 11 to 22, on the edge of a refugee camp in the centre of the Gaza Strip - a small, crowded piece of land on the Mediterranean where 1.8 million people live. Dozens of civilians, including 17 children, are among those who have been killed in the latest Israeli strikes targeting the Islamist group Hamas, according to authorities in Gaza. Israel says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza. Najwa's fears have only heightened with talk of a possible Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. \"You cannot be secure,\" she says. \"As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity.\" Najwa is unsure how much to tell her children about the violence that is unfolding around them. \"I stopped saying anything to them,\" she says. \"[But] it's not easy to hide your fears. Because you do not know if this is a secure place or not.\" But despite her efforts to shield her children from talk of fighting, Najwa knows it is inescapable. \"They're tracking the news all day, even if I told them not to,\" she says. \"It's all over Instagram and social media. It's all destruction.\" Najwa is concerned about the mental toll repeated bouts of conflict that have marked Gaza's recent past is having on her children. Her youngest son, Mohammed, who is nearing his 12th birthday, has already lived through the Israel-Gaza wars of 2008-2009 and 2014, which killed thousands of civilians. \"I can't imagine when he grows up - what are the memories that he wants to tell his children?\" And as the air strikes persist, Najwa is conscious of the effect it is having on her too. \"You cannot get used to all the horrors, you cannot get used to hearing the sounds of children crying and screaming,\" she says. 'We were too scared to stay' When a violent Israeli-Arab mob reached the street outside her home in the town of Lod on Monday night, Tova Levy knew it was time for her Israeli-Jewish family to flee. Throughout the evening, Tova had been reading worrying updates in her community WhatsApp group. Friends sent messages warning that a \"mob\" had left one of the local mosques, and were taking full-scale rioting across the mixed Arab-Jewish Israeli town, lying 15km (9 miles) south-east of Tel Aviv. Soon, she says, the rioters were close to her house, where she lives with her husband and two young children. \"They started burning things. [It was] really, really shocking... I was terrified,\" Tova says. \"I thought, 'What's preventing them from walking up and breaking down my door?'\" The family quickly packed up some of their belongings and fled south, to the home of Tova's brother-in-law, near Beersheba. \"We left as we were too scared to stay,\" she says. Since they left, street fighting in Lod has exploded. Protests by Israeli Arabs in the town turned into full-scale riots on Tuesday night. Demonstrators clashed with police and set cars and buildings ablaze, the day after a funeral for a man allegedly shot dead by Jewish residents. The town's mayor declared: \"Civil war has broken out in Lod.\" Tova has asked a neighbour to take down a mezuzah, a piece of parchment with the Shema prayer inscribed on it, which many Jewish families fix to doorposts on their homes as a reminder of God's presence. \"I'm too afraid that the mobs will break into our house,\" she says. Tova is worried about what will be left when they return. \"We don't know if we are going to have a home to go back to. I don't know if our house is going to be bombed when we go back.\" Since Tova's family left Lod, the town has come under rocket attack. Two Israeli Arabs were killed when a rocket fired from Gaza hit their car on Wednesday. As air raid sirens sounded throughout the night, thousands of people took cover in bomb shelters, including many of Tova's Jewish neighbours who remained in Lod. They had to share the shelters with Arab neighbours, who they believed may have been involved in the riots, heightening their fears. \"Some of the other families decided not to go into the stairwell,\" she says. \"Some of them went down for a bit and then left as soon as they could.\" As tensions escalate, Tova is unsure how to explain what is happening to her four-and-a-half-year-old son. \"He knows that there have been explosions because of bad people,\" she says. \"I still feel like I can't tell him that it's been Arabs who are doing that to us. I want him to be able to live peacefully among his neighbours. I don't want him to grow up with this fear of Arabs.\" Tova worries that her family will only continue to find themselves caught up in the worsening conflict. \"We are all civilians and we are fighting each other,\" she says. \"It's scary; it's very, very scary.\"", "summary": "Depuis que les missiles ont commencé à frapper près de la maison de sa famille dans la bande de Gaza cette semaine, Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad a trop peur pour dormir."}

From Morocco, the journey takes five days, but from countries further down the coastline it can take twice as long. The number of arrivals in 2020 is more than 10 times the total number for 2019. \"I wouldn't want this for anyone because it's not good, but if it's the only way to make a proper living, what can we do?\" Mohamed Zitouni had gone to find his brother at a wharf on the southern tip of the island of Gran Canaria where at one point some 2,600 migrants had been staying in tents or sleeping rough. Arguineguín wharf had been used as a makeshift migrant camp ever since the surge in numbers of people arriving or being picked up at sea by rescue services. They had spoken by phone the previous day, before Rahali's battery ran out. Days after they were reunited, the camp was dismantled. The emergency caused by undocumented arrivals to the archipelago shows little sign of easing. In November alone, about 7,000 migrants reached the archipelago, which has seen the highest number of migrant arrivals since 2006. Conditions on the quayside were cramped and lacked many basic services. In theory, the authorities are allowed to keep them there for 72 hours in order to carry out coronavirus PCR tests and legal procedures, although many migrants reportedly stayed much longer. Why they make the journey An increase in controls on other routes from Africa to Europe - across the Mediterranean to Greece, Italy and mainland Spain - has helped make this more perilous journey across the Atlantic more popular. Relatively good weather conditions have also been a factor. However, more than 600 migrants have drowned making the crossing this year, according to UN figures. Toddler who drowned on the journey Sahé Sephore was 13 months old when she and her mother fell in the water as the boat carrying them and some 30 other people hit rocks near the coast of Gran Canaria in May 2019. She was the first undocumented migrant to be buried formally with their name and surname on a tombstone in the Canaries, reports say. Sea arrivals in Spain in 2020: 35,862 Arrivals in Canary Islands: 19,493 Deaths on Canary Islands route: 650 Source: UNHCR The Spanish government has been paying for around 6,000 migrants to stay in 17 hotels which had been empty or closed because of the impact of Covid-19 on the local tourism industry. Others are staying in makeshift camps. A Senegalese man, also called Mohamed, is staying in the Vista Oasis hotel. He made the crossing in September but says he found out that his two younger brothers both drowned while making the same journey since then. \"We have sacrificed a lot to come here, to work, to get a better life,\" Mohamed told the BBC. \"Because in Africa, if you're not from a family linked to the state, or from a rich family, you're not going to live well. That's what Africa is like.\" What will happen to the new arrivals? Having arrived on the islands, Mohamed is now confused about his legal status and whether he will be able to travel on to mainland Spain or another European country, as he would like. \"We've already heard certain rumours, that the Senegalese will have to return home but I don't know if it's true or false,\" he said. \"Right now, many Senegalese are very frightened, because if we return to Senegal, we don't get anything, no work or anything.\" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has said that the Socialist-led Spanish government prefers not to transfer migrants to the mainland, in order to \"prevent irregular entry routes into Europe\". The administration has started engaging with some African countries, including Senegal, in order to ease the repatriation of migrants, a process that can be legally complex. 'This is an invasion' Critics have accused the Spanish government of failing to prepare for this crisis, which they say led to chaos on Arguineguín wharf and has put local services under pressure. Ana Oramas, a congresswoman from the Canary Coalition (CC) party, described the situation on the archipelago as \"a powder keg\". In recent weeks there have been demonstrations both in favour of and against the immigrants, reflecting the varying reactions of locals to their arrival. \"This is an invasion,\" said Antonio Santana Hidalgo, who works in the tourism industry. \"I respect that everyone has to make a living and survive, but they have to understand you can't just put them up in a hotel with everything included and have them lazing about.\" Ailedis Unsué, who works in a bar, has a different perspective. Hairdresser José María Rodríguez pointed out that Spaniards also had a history of emigration. \"People from the Canaries, Galicians and Basques, we all emigrated,\" he said. \"The difference with this type of migration is that they are coming from countries that are at war, where there's no work and things are really bad.\" The Spanish government says new facilities currently being prepared will house 7,000 migrants, meaning the hotels will be able to be evacuated. \"I think that, despite the difficulties, we have handled this in an agile way,\" said Hana Jalloul, Spain's secretary of state for migration. \"We're not going to make a Moria out of the Canaries,\" she added, referring to the Greek island of Lesbos where fires destroyed an overcrowded migrant camp in September. \"It's not our style of migration policy.\"", "summary": "\"Ce n'est pas une bonne façon de voyager pour venir ici, ni pour mon frère ni pour personne\", se plaint Mohamed Zitouni, un Marocain qui vit en Espagne depuis 20 ans."}

It is hoped the animals can be used to stop malaria spreading and eventually help with eradication. Although the research is still at an early stage, experts say the findings may even lead to new ways of testing for the disease. Studies have already shown that being infected with the malaria parasite changes our aroma to make us more attractive to the mosquitoes that spread the disease. Now dogs are on the scent, too. Smelly socks Socks worn overnight by children in the Upper River Region of The Gambia, in West Africa, were packaged and shipped to the UK. Of the 175 pairs sent, 30 had been worn by children infected with the parasite. The smelly footwear arrived at the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Milton Keynes. The supremely talented noses there are already being trained to sniff out cancer and even the early stages of Parkinson's disease. When it came to spotting malaria, the results, presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, showed dogs could pick out seven in 10 samples from infected children. But they also incorrectly thought one in 10 healthy children had malaria. Researcher Prof Steve Lindsay, from Durham University, said he was \"really excited\" by the findings so far, but that dogs were not yet ready to be used more routinely. The researchers still need to improve the dog's accuracy and test them on people rather than socks, as well as investigate whether the animals can sniff out different species of malaria. The aim is to one day use specially trained dogs at airports to curb the spread of the disease and to find symptomless carriers to help eradication efforts. Dogs could test a whole community in a short space of time. Faster than science Chelci Squires, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: \"Dogs are actually nature's super-smellers so it is a great gift to have them. \"They are much faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests which can take up to 20 minutes and require a fully trained professional to do.\" New tools to detect, treat and prevent malaria are needed as progress is stalling. According to the last global report on the disease, cases had increased by five million to a new total of 216 million cases a year. The research was a collaboration between The National Malaria Control Programme in The Gambia; the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia; Medical Detection Dogs; Durham University; the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Dundee.

But now Ecowas, the West African regional bloc to which Mali belongs, has laid down a firm line, with member heads of state issuing a call for Mr Keïta's reinstatement as president. The weary-sounding 75-year-old had announced his enforced resignation in a televised statement around midnight on Tuesday, apparently from a room at the Kati army base, 15km (nine miles) from Bamako, where he and Mr Cissé had been taken by soldiers that afternoon. This came after more than two months of confrontation with an alliance of opposition politicians and civil society, the M5-RFP, in whose name massive crowds staged a series of street demonstrations shrewdly piloted by the charismatic imam Mahmoud Dicko. Protesters had only one central demand - Mr Keïta's resignation, although Mr Dicko held back from explicitly calling for this himself. In negotiations mediated by Ecowas, Mr Keïta had made concession after concession, but never ceding either his own position or the decisive reforms that would have clearly ended his command of the state machine. You may also be interested in: That was no longer enough and finally a group of senior - but not top-ranking - officers, moved to end his occupation of the presidency. But Ecowas is not prepared to go along with this unconstitutional change of power and its envoy, former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, is soon expected back in Bamako to talk to the putchists. Difficult negotiations lie ahead and no-one can be sure how they will pan out. Lost opportunity When gunshots were heard over the Kati barracks on Tuesday it was not immediately obvious that this was anything other than a mutiny by ordinary soldiers' angered by high-level corruption while they risk their lives in the war against jihadists in the north. But as military vehicles swept from Kati down into Bamako to arrest Mr Keïta and a string of senior figures, it became clear that something much more substantial was under way. For exasperation with Mr Keïta stretched back much further than the face-off with protesters over recent months. Faith in the slogans about restoring national pride that had carried him to election victory over the technocratic Soumaïla Cissé back in 2013 had long since faded. International partners were dismayed by Mr Keïta's failure to use his early popularity to swing politicians and the public behind the difficult compromises required to effectively implement peace with Tuareg separatists in the north, a dilatory approach that left a vacuum in which terrorism could flourish. More about Mali's battle against jihadists But for Malians, particularly in the south and the centre, where most live, Mr Keïta's administration was most tarnished by a string of corruption scandals, sometimes undermining basic services such as the supply of fertiliser to poor farmers, amidst stories about the ostentatious high life of the ruling elite. The president only secured easy re-election in 2018 because traditional opponents and a raft of new centrist groups failed to establish a common front. The issue that finally triggered the massive upsurge of popular anger that spilled on to the streets of Bamako this year was a rather narrowly political one - the decision of the Constitutional Court to overturn the results for 31 parliamentary seats in the elections held over two rounds in March and April. This cancelled voters' humiliation of the government in Bamako constituencies - and it came at a moment when feelings were already raw after northern militants had kidnapped opposition leader Soumaïla Cissé while he was out on the campaign trail in the north, near Timbuktu. He is still a hostage now. Yacht holiday Then after Covid-19 had forced Bamako residents to endure lockdown measures, and while Malian soldiers continued to sacrifice their lives in the northern war, images emerged appearing to show the president's son, Karim - chair of parliament's defence committee - on a holiday yacht abroad. The pictures could not be verified and may have been old. Karim Keïta himself insisted no public expense had been incurred - yet the images could only further fuel perceptions of a presidential circle somehow unengaged and distanced from Mali's multiple crises. Throughout all this Mr Keïta's prime minister struggled assiduously to broker a political path forward and tackle the country's real problems. But Boubou Cissé lacked the independent personal clout to save the beleaguered administration. Ecowas mediation was making progress, but slowly - and then, this week, the soldiers stepped in. So where does Mali go from here? The National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP) Col Assimi Goita:Head of the CNSP and leads Mali's special forces Col Malick Diaw:CNSP vice-president; deputy head of camp where mutiny began Col Ismaël Wagué:Junta's spokesman; from the air force (pictured) Col Sadio Camara:Ex-head of the military academy where the mutiny started Col Modibo Koné:Has played a key role in fighting jihadists For the very short term the UN's large Mali peacekeeping mission, French anti-terrorist forces and national military units deployed in the north and the centre should be able to maintain a stable security position. But the position is fragile and jihadist groups will take heart if there is a prolonged delay in agreeing arrangements for a transition, new elections and an internationally accepted interim government. One person who has already signalled that he will not take a frontline role at this stage is Mr Dicko. The influential imam has declared his intention to step back from politics for now, although he will remain an influential figure, if and when he chooses to exert that influence. In the meantime, much hangs on the talks now expected between the putschists, the M5-RFP and Ecowas.", "summary": "Les foules se sont réjouies après la prise de pouvoir par un groupe d'officiers militaires au Mali, mais tout le monde n'est pas content, écrit Paul Melly, analyste spécialiste de l'Afrique de l'Ouest."}

Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out. Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened. At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal. In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint \"no big deal\" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media. 'I tried to take her to school' Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these. On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety. Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams. \"I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter,\" said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman. \"If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister,\" he said. According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire. Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted \"to make it look like a suicide\". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died. \"One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned,\" Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali. But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone. \"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" you can hear her say. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa. News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni. Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. \"None of the culprits will be spared from legal action,\" she said. Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh. \"Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists,\" said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page. \"I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry,\" wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post. According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher. \"When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations,\" said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association. \"It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples.\" Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh? In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students. \"This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done,\" said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka. \"Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools,\" she said. \"They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment.\"", "summary": "Nusrat Jahan Rafi a été aspergée de kérosène et transformée en torche humaine sur le toit de son école, au Bangladesh."}

At Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday he was found guilty of failing to surrender to the court. He now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a \"dangerous precedent\" where any journalist could face US charges for \"publishing truthful information about the United States\". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: \"I told you so.\" Assange had predicted that he would face extradition to the US if he left the embassy. What happened in court? After his arrest, the 47-year-old Australian national was initially taken to a central London police station before appearing in court. Dressed in a black suit and black polo shirt, he waved to the public gallery and gave a thumbs up. He pleaded not guilty to the 2012 charge of failing to surrender to the court. Finding him guilty of that charge, District Judge Michael Snow said Assange's behaviour was \"the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\". He sent him to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing, where he faces up to 12 months in prison. The court also heard that during his arrest at the embassy he had to be restrained and shouted: \"This is unlawful, I am not leaving.\" Why does the US government want to extradite Assange? Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted. Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files. What are the US charges against him? The indictment against Assange, issued last year in the state of Virginia, alleges that he conspired in 2010 with Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He faces up to five years in jail. Manning downloaded four databases from US departments and agencies between January and May 2010, the indictment says. This information, much of which was classified, was provided to Wikileaks. The US Justice Department described it as \"one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States\". Cracking a password stored on the computers, the indictment alleges, would have allowed Manning to log on to them in such a way as to make it harder for investigators to determine the source of the disclosures. It is unclear whether the password was actually broken. Correspondents say the narrowness of the charge seems intended to avoid falling foul of the US Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press. Why did the Ecuadorian embassy stop protecting him? The Wikileaks co-founder had been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The investigation into the alleged rape, which he denied, was later dropped because he had evaded the arrest warrant. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has said it is now considering whether to resume the inquiry before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020. Scotland Yard said it was invited into the embassy on Thursday by the ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government's withdrawal of asylum. Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno said the country had \"reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange\". Mr Moreno said: \"The most recent incident occurred in January 2019, when Wikileaks leaked Vatican documents. \"This and other publications have confirmed the world's suspicion that Mr Assange is still linked to WikiLeaks and therefore involved in interfering in internal affairs of other states.\" His accusations against Assange also included blocking security cameras at the embassy, accessing security files and confronting guards. Mr Moreno said the British government had confirmed in writing that Assange \"would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty\". The arrest comes a day after Wikileaks said it had uncovered an extensive spying operation against its co-founder at the Ecuadorian embassy. There has been a long-running dispute between the Ecuadorian authorities and Assange about what he was and was not allowed to do in the embassy. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that over the years they had removed his access to the internet and accused him of engaging in political activities - which is not allowed when claiming asylum. He said: \"Precisely what has happened in the embassy is not clear - there has been claim and counter claim.\" How have people reacted? Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: \"This goes to show that in the UK, no one is above the law.\" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of \"years of careful diplomacy\" and that it was \"not acceptable\" for someone to \"escape facing justice\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition \"should be opposed by the British government\". Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders said that the UK should resist extradition, because it would \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future\". Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said he would continue to receive \"the usual consular support\" and that consular officers will try to visit him. And actress Pamela Anderson, who has visited the embassy to support Assange, said the arrest was a \"vile injustice\".

Author of 11 novels, she won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, having published her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in 1970. Her 1987 book Beloved told the story of a runaway female slave and was made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey in 1998. Morrison once said: \"We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\" The Morrison family statement said the \"extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt\" had \"passed away peacefully last night [5 August] surrounded by family and friends\". \"The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing,\" it continued. \"Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life.\" Morrison died at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York. The family added: \"While we would like to thank everyone who knew and loved her, personally or through her work, for their support at this difficult time, we ask for privacy as we mourn this loss to our family. \"We will share information in the near future about how we will celebrate Toni's incredible life.\" Her long-time editor, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf publishers, said: \"She was a great woman and a great writer, and I don't know which I will miss more.\" And Sonny Mehta, the chairman of Knopf, said: \" I can think of few writers in American letters who wrote with more humanity or with more love for language than Toni. \"Her narratives and mesmerising prose have made an indelible mark on our culture. Her novels command and demand our attention. \"They are canonical works, and more importantly, they are books that remain beloved by readers.\" Her fiction When she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy described her as an author \"who in novels characterised by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality\". In 1996 she was honoured with the National Book Foundation's Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, In 2012, President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Morrison was also the first female African-American editor at Random House, where she had the role from 1967 to 1983. She championed writers of colour and published the likes of Gayl Jones, Henry Dumas, Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis, among others. Morrison also taught at Princeton University. 'Storyteller through and through' Professor Noliwe Rooks, who worked with Morrison at Princeton, told the BBC her debut novel, whose protagonist was a young black girl, had broken new ground when it was released in 1970. \"At this moment when [The Bluest Eye] comes out - who's writing about black girls? Who's writing about this kind of trauma? Who's writing about the interior lives of someone like that? Who's writing about black communities?\" said Prof Rooks. \"There was no one who was doing it the way she was, with the truth-telling and the ugliness, as well as the grandeur and the beauty.\" Prof Rooks, now at Cornell University, added that Morrison \"could make a story about going car-shopping sound like some kind of Homeric odyssey\". \"From the moment she left her house to the riding in the back of the Bentley was somehow an epic adventure,\" she said. \"Both at the level of the mundane as well as the epic, the well-honoured, she was a story-teller through and through.\" 'May she rest in power' President Obama remembered Morrison on Tuesday as \"a national treasure\" who was \"as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page\". \"Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination,\" he said. \"What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while.\" Many, including the former tennis champion and activist Billie Jean King, signed off a tribute tweet with: \"May she rest in power.\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote that her death was \"such a loss\", declaring: \"The world needs voices like Toni Morrison's today more than ever.\" In her own tribute, TV writer and producer Shonda Rimes said she had grown up \"wanting to be only her\".

In 2009, 84 children were killed by a batch of teething syrup that contained diethylene glycol, an industrial solvent and ingredient found in antifreeze and brake fluid. Two employees from the company which made the syrup were found guilty by a court. 'Bad drugs' The case was significant as convictions for manufacturing or selling falsified medicines remain uncommon in Nigeria. \"That's the one that got into the papers,\" Dr Alero Roberts said, adding: \"We've had numerous issues.\" Dr Roberts, a senior lecturer at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, is lucky that the hospital has a robust drug procurement system and they do not have problems with falsified medicines, although they do see patients who have encountered bad drugs. She is concerned there may be more in the coming months due to the effect Covid-19 is having on the supply of drugs in Nigeria. \"There are shortages looming - cancer drugs, antibiotics,\" Dr Roberts said. When hospital pharmacies go out of stock, patients will purchase drugs elsewhere, often from unregulated markets. And they do not need to go far, outside her hospital window Dr Roberts can see marketers selling two things - \"drugs and coffins\". Street sellers peddling drugs is a familiar scene across West Africa - where in many countries the sale of pharmaceuticals is more a trade than a profession. The lack of regulatory oversight is one of the reasons why the region is so attractive to criminals in the business of falsifying medicines. And in West Africa it is a big business. The criminals have been keeping the head of the Intellectual Property Rights Unit at the customs service, Mohammed Babandede, and his team busy of late as the pandemic has created the perfect storm for fake medicines to flourish. \"It is really scary,\" he said, adding that in one week more than 30 million counterfeit tablets had been seized. He explained that authorities in India had provided intelligence on a shipment coming into Tin Can Island Port in Lagos, the commercial capital. Powerful networks The consignment included significant amounts of counterfeit dexamethasone - a medicine believed to treat severe Covid-19 symptoms. In the same week, he also intercepted 920,000 fake tramadol tablets at Lagos airport that had come from India's main city, Mumbai. These pills were likely destined for markets in northern Nigeria where abuse of the drug is rampant. You may want to watch: Mr Mohammed said that catching the suspects was difficult as consignments were often labelled with fictitious addresses at both ends - meaning authorities cannot trace the goods to source. In Nigeria, when there are arrests, often the networks are so powerful that there are rarely prosecutions - the best lawyers are hired to negotiate bail or find ways to adjourn court cases for many years. Adebayo Alonge knows all too well how dangerous these groups are. A victim of fake drugs himself, Mr Alonge purchased salbutamol in 2003 from a chemist in Ibadan in the south-west. The drugs were falsely labelled and contained fatal levels of diazepam that left him in a coma for three weeks. This experience inspired him to launch RxAll, a company that uses technology to identify the quality of prescription drugs. Last year, he started receiving death threats for his work. \"We won't stop - I have died once already, I'm not afraid to die again,\" he said. Holed up in small warehouses in cities across West Africa there are people in the business of repackaging pharmaceuticals. They may also be busy tampering with expiry dates or manufacturing goods from scratch. Sometimes, these clandestine make-shift laboratories are raided by enforcement agencies and the goods are destroyed - but the scale of the networks and operations mean it does not take long for them to pop up elsewhere. Labelled as 'humanitarian donations' The routes criminal groups are taking are becoming increasingly complex. \"They are getting wiser. If you block a route, they will find a different one. This is why it is a big problem in West Africa and Nigeria,\" a visibly concerned Mr Mohammed said. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime and World Customs Organization have set up a special unit to help regional states fight the criminal networks. Bob Van den Berghe, a law enforcement expert who is attached to the unit, said that 81kg of pharmaceutical products in a container labelled as carrying \"boxes of humanitarian donations\" were seized from a port in West Africa earlier this year. That container was shipped from France, but officials have uncovered fake medicines in containers originating from a wide range of countries, including Brazil and Switzerland, he said. The unit reported that its highest number of seizures were at ports in the Togolese city of Lomé in Togo and Cotonou in Benin. Containers that get past port surveillance teams are stripped and the medicines broken up into smaller packages, then taken across borders - some go north to Burkina Faso, others into Ghana and on to Ivory Coast, and others east into Nigeria, research shows. Matter of life and death With under resourced border teams and large porous borders, authorities have their work cut out. \"We are ramping up our operations, focusing on more border crossing points to respond to the efforts of these criminals,\" Mr Van den Berghe said. With an estimated 116,000 deaths a year caused by substandard and falsified anti-malarial drugs in sub-Saharan Africa alone, these operations could be a matter of life and death. Yet, experts warn that if the overall war against fake medicines is to be won, more must be done to ensure access to healthcare for all. \"There must be a parallel effort to fix vulnerabilities in health markets in West Africa; in some countries, wealth has become a determining factor for gaining access to quality healthcare and drugs.\" \"Hopefully the weaknesses in health systems Covid-19 has further exposed will lead governments to prioritise ensuring every citizen has access to safe and affordable medicines\", said Dr Gernot Klantschnig, a senior lecturer in International Criminology at Bristol University in England.", "summary": "L'industrie pharmaceutique de contrefaçon est florissante en Afrique de l'Ouest, où les forces de l'ordre se battent pour mettre fin aux activités des syndicats du crime qui opèrent avec des connexions internationales, écrit Emma Hooper."}

Money was tight, and her options were already narrow, but there was an order to things that made sense. She attended school and cherished it. She had few worries. Then her father died when she was 12, and her mother died a few years later. \"Life became so hard then,\" she said, in a conversation from her village in rural western Kenya. \"I had to drop out of school and fend for myself.\" At 22, Adama met a man and got pregnant, but he died three days after their baby daughter was born. Her loneliness deepened. She nursed her baby through an infant sickness until the girl improved, at about 18 months, then a steady income was needed to keep them both alive. So Adama left the baby with her elderly grandmother and headed to Nairobi to find work. \"Bear in mind you are going to get a living for your child,\" her grandmother said. Adama arrived in Nairobi and began by selling watermelon on the street, but it didn't pay enough and her housemate stole any money she left at home. Life in the city was hard too: she has a scar at the top of her forehead, just under her cropped hair, from defending herself. \"Some men were playing with me and it reached a point I had to fight back,\" she said. She moved on to work on a construction site, where she wasn't paid at all, and from there to a nightclub, where she instructed her boss to send her pay directly back to her grandma in the village. After a while, Adama took a little more of her pay in Nairobi so she could rent a place to live. She found a new job with slightly better wages at another construction site, and met a man there. The two dated for a while and he told her he wanted to have a child. Adama offered him a deal — if she could bring her baby girl to live with them, they could have a child together. He agreed, and for five months of Adama's pregnancy he paid the rent and bills and bought food for their home, and Adama waited for the right time to bring her baby girl into the city. Then he left one day and never came back. Many women will know the anxiety of preparing to bring a child into the world without enough money to feed one person, let alone two. Most will never contemplate selling a child to a stranger. But for some expectant mothers in poverty in Kenya, selling a baby to traffickers has become the last in a limited number of options for survival. The traffickers pay shockingly low sums. Sarah was 17 when she fell pregnant with her second child, with no means to support the baby, she said. She sold him to a woman who offered her 3,000 Kenyan shillings - about £20. \"At that point I was young, I never thought what I was doing was wrong,\" she said. \"After five years it hit me, and I wanted to refund her the money.\" She said she knew other women who had sold babies for similar sums. \"Many girls sell their babies due to challenges. Maybe she has been chased from home by her mum and she has nothing, or she was still in school when she got pregnant. That is too many problems for a girl who is 15 or 16. \"You will find girls losing their baby and everything they own because there is no one to hold their hand.\" Kenya has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Africa, and health experts say the problem has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, with some women pushed into sex work to survive and girls losing the structure of the school system. \"I've heard so many stories of women and girls in this situation. Young women are coming into cities looking for jobs, getting into relationships, conceiving, and being abandoned by the father of their child,\" said Prudence Mutiso, a Kenyan human rights lawyer who specialises in child protection and reproductive rights. \"If the father will not pay, then these women and girls have to find other ways to substitute for that income. And that is what drives them to these baby sellers, so that they can get some form of income to support themselves and perhaps children they already have back home. People don't speak about this in the open, but it is there.\" Adama hid her pregnancy for as long as she could at the construction site, until she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement or disguise her bump. Then she had no income to cover her rent. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. At eight months pregnant, Adama began breaking back into the house late at night just to sleep and leaving first thing in the morning. \"On a good day I would be lucky to get food,\" she said. \"Sometimes I would just drink water, pray, and sleep.\" When a woman finds herself in Adama's position in Kenya, several factors can converge to push them into the hands of traffickers. Abortion is illegal unless the life of the mother or the child is at risk, leaving only dangerous unlicensed alternatives on the table. There is also a significant lack of sex and reproductive health education for adolescents, particularly in rural areas, as well as a lack of awareness around legal adoption processes. \"Women and girls with unwanted pregnancies do not have support from the government,\" said Ibrahim Ali, Kenya programme manager for the charity Health Poverty Action. \"These women have often been victimised and stigmatised, especially in rural areas, and they tend to run away, and that puts them in vulnerable situations in cities.\" Adama had no idea what legal options would be open to her to give up her child safely, and no understanding of the adoption process. \"I was not aware of it at all,\" she said. \"I had never heard of it.\" She contemplated a backstreet abortion, she said, but could not reconcile the idea with her faith. Then she contemplated taking her own life. \"I was so stressed, I started thinking how I would commit suicide by drowning myself, so people could just forget about me.\" But a few weeks before her due date, someone introduced Adama to a well-dressed woman named Mary Auma, who told her not to have an abortion or end her life. Mary Auma runs an illegal street clinic in the Nairobi slum Kayole. She gave Adama 100 shillings and told her to come to the clinic the following day. Mary Auma's makeshift clinic is not really a clinic, it's two rooms hidden behind an inconspicuous shopfront on a Kayole street. Inside there are a few mostly empty shelves scattered with old medicinal products, behind which are the rooms for women to give birth. Auma sits inside with her assistant, buying and selling babies for a profit, without the inconvenience of having to check who is buying them or what for. She told Adama that her buyers were loving parents unable to conceive, who would provide for a much-wanted child. But in reality Auma will sell a baby to someone who walks in off the street with the right amount of cash. Auma also tells expectant mothers that she is a former nurse, but she does not have the medical equipment, skills, or sanitation to deal with a serious problem during childbirth. \"Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,\" Adama recalled. \"But I was desperate, I didn't have a choice.\" When Adama arrived at the clinic, Mary Auma gave her two tablets without warning, to induce labour, Adama said. Auma had a buyer lined up and she was anxious to make a sale. But when Adama gave birth, the baby boy developed chest problems and needed urgent care, and Auma told Adama to take him to hospital. After a week in hospital, Adama was discharged with a healthy boy. The landlord that had kicked her out when she was pregnant allowed her to return and she nursed the baby. Shortly after she ran into Mary Auma again at the market, she said, and Auma gave her another 100 shillings and told her to come to the clinic the next day. \"New package has been born,\" Auma texted her buyer. \"45,000k.\" Mary Auma wasn't offering Adama the 45,000 shillings — £300 — she was quoting the buyer. She offered Adama 10,000 — about £70. But Mary Auma didn't know the buyer she had lined up was an undercover reporter working for the the BBC, as part of a year-long investigation into child trafficking. When Adama went to the makeshift clinic the next day, she sat in the backroom, cradling her baby son in her arms. In a whispered discussion, the supposed buyer told her she had other options, and Adama had a change of heart. She left the clinic that day holding her son, and took him to a government-run children's home, where he will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. The BBC asked Mary Auma to respond to the allegations in this story, but she declined. Adama is 29 now, and living again in the village where she was raised. She still goes to bed hungry sometimes. Life is still hard. She gets occasional work at a small hotel nearby but not enough. She struggles not to drink. She dreams of opening her own shoe shop in the village and bringing in shoes from Nairobi, but it is a distant dream. She has no contact with her son, but she has no regrets. \"I was not happy selling my child, I did not even want to touch that money,\" she said. \"When there was no money involved in giving him up, then I was OK.\" She knows the neighbourhood around the children's home where she left her son. It is near the house she was kicked out of when she was almost ready to give birth to him. \"I know the area is safe,\" she said, \"and the people looking after him are good.\" Additional reporting by Njeri Mwangi.

A spokesman for his APRC party denied the accusations made against Mr Jammeh. \"We as a party and The Gambian people are tired of the steady stream of unfounded allegations that have been reported against our ex-president,\" said Ousman Rambo Jatta, in a written statement to the BBC. \"The ex-president has no time to react to lies and smear campaigns. He is a very respectable God fearing and pious leader who has nothing but respect for our Gambian women,\" the deputy APRC leader said. Ms Jallow told the BBC she wanted to meet Mr Jammeh, 54, in court so he could face justice. \"I've really tried to hide the story and erase it and make sure it's not part of me. \"Realistically I couldn't so I decided to speak now because it is time to tell the story and to make sure that Yayha Jammeh hears what he has done.\" She said she also wanted to testify before The Gambia's Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), which has been set up by President Adama Barrow, who won elections in December 2016. The TTRC is investigating human rights violations alleged to have been committed during Mr Jammeh's 22-year rule, including reports of extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary detention. He was forced from office in January 2017 after regional powers sent in troops when he refused to give up power. 'Marriage refusal' Ms Jallow said she was 18 when she met Mr Jammeh after winning a beauty pageant in 2014 in the capital, Banjul. In the months following her coronation, she said the former president acted as a father figure when they met, offering her advice, gifts and money, and also organising for running water to be installed in her family home. Then at a dinner organised by an aide to the president, she says he asked her to marry him. She refused and rebuffed other enticements from the aide to agree to the offer. Ms Jallow said the aide then insisted she attend a religious ceremony at State House in her role as beauty queen in June 2015. But when she arrived, she was taken to the president's private residence. \"It was clear what this was going to be,\" she said, describing Mr Jammeh's anger at her for rejecting him. Yahya Jammeh: At a glance Read: Profile of Gambia's former strongman Ms Jallow says he slapped her and injected her in her arm with a needle. \"He rubbed his genitals in my face, pushed me down to my knees, pulled my dress up and sodomised me.\" 'Protocol girls' The young woman says afterwards she locked herself at home for three days and then decided to flee to neighbouring Senegal. Once in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, Ms Jallow sought the assistance of various human rights organisations. Weeks later, she was approved protection status and moved to Canada, where she has been living since. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trial International say Mr Jammeh had a system in place to abuse women, where some were put on the state payroll and worked at State House as so-called \"protocol girls\", who had some clerical duties but were mainly on call to have sex with the president. The BBC could not verify the allegation, but a former Gambian official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said he was aware of \"inappropriate things\" happening at the presidency: \"Protocol staff were mostly women and they were hired to satisfy the president's fantasies.\" He remembered seeing Ms Jallow at State House, sometimes at \"odd hours\". More on The Gambia: Another woman, hired as a protocol officer at the age of 23, told HRW she was forced to have sex with Mr Jammeh in 2015. The woman, who asked not to be named, said that one day the president called her into his room: \"He started undressing me and saying that he was in love with me, that he will do anything for me and my family, that I should not tell anyone because if I do I will face the consequences. \"I felt I had no choice. That day he slept with me without protection.\" 'Some felt honoured' Another woman who worked as a protocol officer said that they knew if one of them was called it was for sex. \"Some wanted it. They felt honoured or wanted the money,\" she told HRW on condition of anonymity. She described how she was sexually assaulted by the president at his summer house, Kanilai, in 2013 when she was 22: \"One evening, a presidential aide called me and told me to come with her to the president's private apartment. He asked me to undress. \"He told me that I was young and needed protection so he wanted to apply spiritual water on me.\" In an encounter the next day, she started crying as Mr Jammeh began to touch her body. He became angry and sent her away. She says she was later sacked and a promised scholarship cancelled. TRRC Executive Secretary Baba Jallow has told the BBC that the commission, launched eight months ago, will focus on sexual violence in September. \"We are aware of allegations involving Jammeh but we have not heard victims on the record yet. Investigations have already started but at this stage we can't say who is involved and how many victims there are,\" he said. The TRRC's mission: Read: 'I was tortured in The Gambia' Ms Jallow wants to create an atmosphere where women will feel safer to talk about rape and sexual assault: \"It's a step-by-step thing and the first part is to acknowledge it happened. \"When many other women speak up and it becomes safer and safer,\" she told the BBC. President Barrow has said he will await the report of the TRRC before considering whether to pursue Mr Jammeh's extradition from Equatorial Guinea.", "summary": "En Gambie, les accusations de viol portées par la reine de beauté, Fatou \"Toufah\" Jallow, à l'encontre de l'ancien président en exil Yahya Jammeh continuent de faire de l'effet."}

He said it followed an order last week by President Donald Trump calling for an end to migrant family separations. But Mr Trump had suggested the families would instead be detained together. The Republican president bowed to public pressure last Wednesday, signing his executive order to \"keep families together\" in migrant detentions. Mr McAleenan maintained that the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" tactics were still in effect, although the commissioner's guidance to his agents largely leaves the policy in limbo. What does this mean for families? The CBP chief said parents cannot be prosecuted if US officials no longer intend to separate them from their children, who are legally not allowed to be kept in adult detention facilities. He said his agency and the Department of Justice must figure out how to prosecute the parents without splitting them from their children, the Associated Press news agency reported. The border official's decision paves the way for US immigration enforcement to revert largely to the approach under the Obama administration. It means US border agents who stop undocumented adult migrants accompanied by children will hand them a court summons and allow them to go on their way, rather than hold them in a detention facility. Adults unaccompanied by children will still be detained. Mr Trump repeatedly lamented this \"catch and release\" policy before his administration began in April criminally prosecuting adult migrants and holding their children separately to deter border crossings. On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the reality was that the US did not have the space to hold all the undocumented families coming across the US-Mexico border. \"We're not changing the policy,\" she told reporters. \"We're simply out of resources.\" What is the Trump administration proposing? Mr Trump earlier said that the US needed \"a nice simple system that works\". \"We want a system where, when people come in illegally, they have to go out,\" he said. The Pentagon confirmed on Monday that two Texas military bases will be used as temporary camps to house the immigrants. But Defence Secretary Jim Mattis did not specify whether the facilities - Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base - would house migrant families together. US media earlier reported that one of the bases would be used to house migrant families and the other would shelter undocumented children who enter the US unaccompanied by an adult. Meanwhile, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions talked tough on immigration at a school police officers' conference in Reno, Nevada, on Monday. America's top law official said that refusing to prosecute adults who illegally enter the US \"would be a disservice to the people of this country\", reports the New York Times. He told the audience that lax border enforcement would \"encourage more adults to bring more children illegally\". However, he also said the Trump administration would \"do everything in our power to avoid separating families\". What's the latest on families already divided? The government has yet to reunite parents with more than 2,000 children who have been taken away since last month and sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sought a federal court injunction in San Diego, California, on Monday to stop the administration from separating undocumented immigrant parents from their children. It said that Mr Trump's order to end separations contained \"loopholes\". Court papers filed by the ACLU contained numerous accounts of parents unable to locate or communicate with their children after they were separated by border officials. In one declaration filed with the brief, a mother identified only by her initials E.J.O.E. said the government told her she would be reunited with her son as she applied for asylum. But she says she was deported without her eight-year-old boy. More than 20 separated children are at a US government tent camp in Tornillo, Texas. CBS News, which was allowed to tour the facility, said the commander in charge described the \"zero tolerance\" policy as \"a dumb, stupid decision that should've never happened\".", "summary": "Un chef de la sécurité des frontières des États-Unis dit avoir temporairement interrompu les poursuites criminelles contre les migrants qui entrent illégalement dans le pays avec des enfants."}

Inside were poorly-preserved mummies. It is thought the dead were given gold foil amulets shaped like tongues so that they could speak before the court of the god Osiris in the afterlife. Ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris was lord of the underworld and judge of the dead. The god was also pictured in gilded decorations on the cartonnage - a material made of layers of plaster, linen and glue - that was partially encasing one of the mummies, lead archaeologist Kathleen Martinez of the University of Santo Domingo was cited by the antiquities ministry as saying. The gilded decorations on the cartonnage around a second mummy's head depicted a crown, horns and a cobra snake, she added. On the chest, the decorations depicted a necklace from which hung the head of a falcon - the symbol of the god Horus. Khaled Abo El Hamd, director general of the antiquities authority in Alexandria, said the archaeological mission at Taposiris Magna had also discovered the funeral mask of a woman, eight golden flakes of a golden wreath, and eight marble masks dating back to the Greek and Roman eras. The antiquities ministry said a number of coins bearing the name and portrait of Queen Cleopatra VII had previously been found inside the temple.

She is often present when the support these machines provide is withdrawn. Ms Nittla has been working for the NHS as an intensive care specialist nurse for the past 16 years. The work can be traumatic and painful, the 42-year-old says. \"Sometimes I feel like I am somewhat responsible for someone's death.\" Ventilators take over the body's breathing process when coronavirus has caused the lungs to fail. This gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover, but sometimes it's not enough. Medical teams face tough decisions about when to stop treatment for patients who aren't getting better. The decision is made after careful consideration, analysing factors such as the age of the patient, underlying health conditions, their response to the virus and likelihood of recovery. At the start of a morning shift in the second week of April, Ms Nittla was told by the registrar in the ICU that her first task would be to stop treatment for a nurse in her 50s with Covid-19. Restrictions in place at the time meant that she had to talk through what would happen with the woman's daughter on the phone (Health Secretary Matt Hancock has since said that close family members would be able to see dying relatives to say goodbye under new coronavirus guidelines). \"I reassured her that her mum was not in pain and looked very comfortable,\" Ms Nittla said. \"I also asked about her mother's wishes and religious needs.\" Ms Nittla's patient was in an eight-bed bay, surrounded by people who were also unconscious. \"I closed the curtains and turned off all the alarms.\" The medical team stopped talking and Ms Nittla placed a phone next to the patient's ear, and asked her daughter to speak. Ms Nittla played the music the family had requested and the support provided by the ventilator was withdrawn. \"I saw flashing lights on the monitor and the heart rate hit zero - flat line - on the screen,\" she says. \"I stood beside her, holding her hands until she passed away.\" The patient died in less than five minutes and Ms Nittla disconnected the tubes providing sedation drugs. The patient's daughter was still talking to her mother and Ms Nittla picked up the handset to tell her it was all over. \"With the help of a colleague, I gave her a bed bath and wrapped her in a white shroud and placed her in a body bag. I put a sign of the cross on her forehead before closing the bag,\" she says. Nightmares Ms Nittla says that being able to care for the dying has helped her cope with the crisis. Due to a massive surge in the number of admissions, the hospital's critical care unit has expanded from 34 to 60 beds. \"Normally in critical care we maintain a one-to-one ratio [one nurse per patient]. Now it is one nurse for every three,\" says Ms Nittla. \"If the situation continues to worsen, it will be one for every six patients.\" Some nurses in her team have shown symptoms of the virus and are now in self-isolation. The hospital is retraining other support nurses to work in critical care. \"Before the start of the shift we hold our hands together and say 'stay safe!'. We keep an eye on each other. We make sure everyone is wearing the gloves, masks and protective gear properly,\" says Ms Nittla. The ICU is recording one death per day, well above the average they had before the pandemic. \"It is daunting,\" says Ms Nittla. As a senior sister, she sometimes has to suppress her own fears. \"I do have nightmares. I am unable to sleep. I worry I will get the virus. Everyone is scared.\" Last year she was away from work for months after getting tuberculosis. She knows her lung capacity is diminished. \"People tell me I shouldn't be working but this is a pandemic. I put everything aside and do my job,\" she says. \"At the end of my shift I do think of the patients who died in my care, but I try to switch off when I step outside of the hospital.\" Since speaking to the BBC, Ms Nittla has been asked by her employer to remain at home, due to her underlying health condition. She plans to continue to offer support by doing administrative tasks, working from home. What is 100 Women? BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

And Inside Amy Schumer was named best variety sketch series. It was the first time since it began in 2011 that Game of Thrones had won the best drama series award. Its other accolades included best writing, best direction and best supporting actor for Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister. Amazon's comedy-drama Transparent won awards for best director in a comedy and for its lead actor, Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a transgender college professor.

Viola Davis won her Emmy for lead actress in a drama thanks to her role as a tough criminal defence lawyer in ABC's How to Get Away With Murder. Accepting her award, she said: \"The only thing that separates women of colour from anyone else is opportunity. Jon Hamm, who played Don Draper in the drama Mad Men, set in an advertising agency primarily in the 1960s, said: \"It's incredible and impossible for me personally to be standing here.\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus won best comedy actress for the fourth time for playing Selina Meyer on Veep, while Tony Hale, who plays her bag man, was again named best comedy supporting actor. Veep, which is set in the office of the fictional vice-president and subsequent president of the United States, Selina Meyer, also won the comedy writing statuette.

She said the president did not know most of the officials he had appointed. Mr Buhari, who is on a visit to Germany, has responded by saying his wife belonged in his kitchen. Standing alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a news conference, the president laughed off his wife's accusations. \"I don't know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room,\" he said. The remarks earned him a glare from Chancellor Merkel. Mr Buhari said that having run for president three times and having succeeded the fourth, he could \"claim superior knowledge over her\". The influence 'of a few people' Mr Buhari was elected last year with a promise to tackle corruption and nepotism in government. But in the interview with Naziru Mikailu from BBC Hausa, Mrs Buhari said: \"The president does not know 45 out of 50 of the people he appointed and I don't know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years.\" She said people who did not share the vision of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were now appointed to top posts because of the influence a \"few people\" wield. \"Some people are sitting down in their homes folding their arms only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position,\" she said. His wife's decision to go public with her concerns will shock many people, but it shows the level of discontent with the president's leadership, says the BBC's Naziru Mikailu in the capital, Abuja. A turning point for Nigeria? Analysis by Naziru Mikailu in Abuja Aisha Buhari campaigned vigorously for her husband in last year's election in Nigeria, organising town hall meetings with women's groups and youth organisations across the country. However, she kept a low profile at the start of the administration and was barely seen or heard. She was restricted to her work on the empowerment of women and helping victims of the Boko Haram conflict in the north-east of the country where she is from. This is one of the reasons why this damning interview has caught the attention of many Nigerians. It is a significant blow for Mr Buhari, who has a reputation for being a tough, no-nonsense president. Her comments also bolster accusations that his government has been hijacked by a small group of individuals. Critics say a large number of people have been appointed because of their relationship with those people in one way or the other. Mrs Buhari was prompted to to speak out in an effort to end those practices so that party loyalists who contributed to his election victory could benefit. Her critics say she is speaking out only because she failed to convince the president to appoint her own people. However, as the closest person to the president, she must have exhausted all avenues before criticising him in the media. The comments could also mark a turning point for a government that has clearly struggled to deal with economic recession and is facing growing disquiet within the ruling party. The Nigerian economy, battered by low global oil prices and a currency devaluation, officially entered recession in August for the first time in a decade. Oil sales account for 70% of government income. The president famously remarked at his inauguration that he \"belongs to nobody and belongs to everybody\". Asked to name those who had hijacked the government, she refused, saying: \"You will know them if you watch television.\" On whether the president was in charge, she said: \"That is left for the people to decide.\" Mrs Buhari, who at 45, is 23 years her husband's junior, said he had not told her whether he would contest the 2019 election. \"He is yet to tell me but I have decided as his wife, that if things continue like this up to 2019, I will not go out and campaign again and ask any woman to vote like I did before. I will never do it again.\" Nigerians have been weighing in on Twitter to give their judgement on the first lady's frank interview: Asked what she regarded as the government's major achievement, she said it was to improve security in the north-east where militant Islamist group Boko Haram has waged an insurgency since 2009. \"No-one is complaining about being attacked in their own homes. Thankfully everyone can walk around freely, go to places of worship, etc. Even kids in Maiduguri have returned to schools,\" Mrs Buhari said, referring to the city which was once the headquarters of the militant group.", "summary": "L'épouse du président nigérian Muhammadu Buhari menace de ne pas soutenir son mari s'il se présente à la prochaine élection présidentielle avec ses collaborateurs actuels."}

In Lebanon, protesters have paralysed the country and seem set to bring down the government of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. In recent weeks the Egyptian security forces crushed attempts to protest against the police state of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt have plenty of differences. But the protesters have grievances in common, and they are shared by millions of people, particularly the young, across the Arab Middle East. A rough approximation is that 60% of the region's population is under the age of 30. A young population can be a great asset to a country. But only if the economy, the educational system and the institutions of the state are functioning well enough to accommodate their needs, and with some exceptions that is not happening. The young in Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region are very often consumed by frustration that slips easily into rage. Rampant corruption Two of the biggest complaints are against corruption and unemployment. One leads to another. Iraq ranks as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, according to a number of indices of worldwide corruption. Lebanon is slightly better, but not by much. Corruption is a cancer. It eats away at ambition and hope for those who become its victims. The losers in a corrupt system can get very angry, very quickly when even the educated cannot get jobs, and they see small cliques lining their pockets. When the institutions of the state - the government, the courts and the police - are implicated, it is a sign that the entire system is failing. In both Lebanon and Iraq, demonstrators not only want their governments to resign. They also want the entire system of governance to be reformed or replaced. Live fire One of the tragic realities of Iraq is that violence has become ingrained in society. When demonstrators, chanting against unemployment, corruption and the government, took to the streets, it did not take long for live ammunition to be used against them. The demonstrations on Iraq's streets, so far, seem to be leaderless. But the fear in the government must be that as time goes by, and casualties mount, they could become more organised. Demonstrators have targeted bastions of government power, notably the walled off Green Zone in Baghdad. It used to be the centre of the American occupation. Now it is the place where government offices and embassies are located, as well as the homes of prominent people. The demonstrations started in Baghdad, and have spread. Overnight in the holy city of Karbala there were unconfirmed reports of many killed and injured when demonstrators were fired on. Video has been posted on social media of men running from live fire. Ever since the protests started, the casualty rate has climbed steadily. Reports from Baghdad say that some Iraqi soldiers have appeared wearing the national flag wrapped around their shoulders, showing what seems to be some solidarity with the protesters. But reports also say that men dressed in black, some masked, have been opening fire. One theory is that they are from pro-Iranian militias. Unfinished business The demonstrations started in Lebanon on 17 October after the government tried introduce taxes on tobacco, petrol and WhatsApp calls. The new taxes were cancelled quickly but it was too late. To start with, the demonstrations in Lebanon were good-humoured. But the very real tensions in the country are showing, with some outbreaks of violence. So is it an Arab spring? More than anything it is a sign of the unfinished business left by 2011. The uprisings of that year did not bring the freedom longed for by the people who demonstrated against tyrannical leaders. But the consequences of the upheaval are still being felt, among them wars in Syria, Yemen and Libya, and a much tougher police state in Egypt. And the grievances which fuelled the 2011 uprisings are still there, in some cases deepened. The failure of corrupt systems to accommodate the needs of a large and young population guarantees that the anger and frustration behind the demonstrations will not go away.", "summary": "Alors que le dernier été du Moyen-Orient s'estompe, la région glisse-t-elle vers un nouveau printemps arabe ?"}

A former law student at Yangon University, he entered the Defence Services Academy on his third attempt in 1974. The relatively unassuming infantryman kept getting regular promotions and moved up the ladder, eventually becoming commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-2 in 2009. In this role, he oversaw operations in north-eastern Myanmar, which led to tens of thousands of ethnic minority refugees fleeing the eastern Shan province and the Kokang region, along the Chinese border. Despite allegations of murder, rape and arson against his troops, Min Aung Hlaing continued to rise and in August 2010 he became joint chief of staff. Less than a year later, he was tapped for the military's top post ahead of more senior generals, succeeding long-time leader Than Shwe as commander-in-chief in March 2011. When Min Aung Hlaing became military chief, blogger and writer Hla Oo - who said they had known each other in childhood - described him as \"a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army\", but also called him a \"serious scholar and gentleman\". Political influence and 'genocide' Min Aung Hlaing began his tenure as military chief as Myanmar transitioned to democracy in 2011 after decades of military rule, but remained keen on maintaining the Tatmadaw's power. His political influence and social media presence increased as the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) led the government. In 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, he seemingly adapted to the change by working and appearing at public events with her. Despite the change, he ensured the Tatmadaw continued to hold 25% of parliamentary seats and crucial security-related cabinet portfolios, while resisting the NLD's attempts to amend the constitution and limit military power. In 2016 and 2017, the military intensified a crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority in the northern Rakhine state, leading to many Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar. The military chief was condemned internationally for the alleged \"genocide\", and in August 2018 the UN Human Rights Council said: \"Myanmar's top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States.\" Following the council's statement, Facebook deleted his account, along with those of other individuals and organisations who it said had \"committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country\". The US sanctioned him twice - in 2019 for his alleged role in \"ethnic cleansing\" and human rights violations, and in July 2020 the UK also imposed sanctions on him. Seizing power The November 2020 general election saw a landslide win for the NLD, according to official figures, but in subsequent months the Tatmadaw and military-backed USDP repeatedly disputed the results. The USDP made allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Those claims were dismissed by the election commission ahead of a planned parliament session on 1 February to confirm the new government. Speculation of a coup grew amid the stand-off between the government and the armed forces. On 27 January Min Aung Hlaing warned that \"the constitution shall be abolished, if not followed\", citing example of previous military coups in 1962 and 1988. His office seemingly reversed this stance by 30 January, saying that the media had misinterpreted military officials' words about abolishing the constitution. However, on the morning of 1 February, the Tatmadaw detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior leaders, and declared a year-long state of emergency. Min Aung Hlaing assumed all state power for this period in his capacity as commander-in-chief, and immediately prioritised the alleged electoral irregularities. A meeting of the National Defence and Security Council led by him said it would investigate the fraud claims and hold new elections, effectively invalidating the NLD's win. Min Aung Hlaing was originally due to step down as commander-in-chief after reaching the retirement age of 65 in July this year, but has now given himself at least another year in power - and potentially longer - with Myanmar's apparent return to military rule. As Myanmar faces an uncertain future with the state of emergency, he has cemented his power and taken charge of the country.

There are 262 million young people without access to school, with the worst problems in sub-Saharan Africa. The UN agency warns that the numbers missing out on education are unlikely to fall much in the next decade. The report examines progress towards global targets, the \"sustainable development goals\", which in 2015 the international community committed to achieve by 2030. Progress stalled These included promises on education - but after four years, the projections from Unesco show, they are already off track and unlikely to be achieved without a significant change of direction. About 18% of children are without school places - and Unesco's report says on current trends this will have fallen to 14% by the end of the next decade, which will still mean 225 million out of school. There had been more progress in the early years of the century, particularly in reducing the number of primary age children who do not even get the first basics of an education. The out-of-school rate for primary years had fallen from 15% to 9% between 2000 and 2008 - but, the report says, progress then seemed to stall. This has been linked to a reduction in overseas aid in the wake of the financial crash. But it also reflects the fact there is a hard-to-reach group of children whose chances of going to school have been disrupted by war and violence, being forced to become refugees, corruption and political failure. Lack of teachers There are inequalities of access - such as barriers to girls and rural families getting an education. But the biggest gap is related to poverty - with only 4% of youngsters in low-income families staying on to the end of secondary school. The report also highlights practical problems, such as an acute lack of trained teachers. The proportion of teachers with at least basic training has fallen in sub-Saharan Africa, so the problem is worse now than at the beginning of the century. The growing population has also been a challenge in this region - and 54% of all the children without school are now in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 41% in 2000. Across the world, the Unesco report says, by 2030 about 90% of adults will be literate. But in low-income countries, there will still be 30% of adults who are illiterate. Damaged in war Unesco also highlights the differences in outcomes between developing countries. Liberia is among the least likely to provide education for all its children, with many school buildings being damaged by conflict and many teachers leaving the country. But Ethiopia is seen as making much better progress, investing more than a quarter of its budget on education and raising the numbers of girls in school and female teachers. Nepal and Afghanistan are also seen as making considerable improvements in access to education. Broken promises This is the latest in a series of missed education targets after high-profile international pledges - despite education being seen as important for improving health and prosperity in poorer countries and preventing extremism. Promises made in 1990 to ensure access to primary education were not achieved by the deadline of 2000. These were replaced by millennium goals for improving global education, which were missed by the 2015 deadline. These were followed by the sustainable development goals set in 2015. These promised that all children would be able to complete primary and secondary education by 2030. But, the report from Unesco says, after almost a third of the 15-year target has elapsed, the trends suggest these goals are likely to be missed. \"The world is far off track on achieving international commitments to education,\" the report says. \"For several years now, no progress has been made on access into primary and secondary education. Only one in two young people complete secondary school.\"", "summary": "L'objectif des dirigeants de donner une éducation primaire à tous les enfants de la planète d'ici à 2030 risque de ne pas être atteint, selon l'Unesco."}

Nigeria's police denies allegations that it used unnecessary force. The country's army said Amnesty was trying to tarnish its reputation. Amnesty's report is based on interviews with almost 200 people, alongside more than 100 photographs and 87 videos. Among the allegations contained in the report are what Amnesty called \"extrajudicial executions\", when 60 people were shot and killed in south-eastern Onitsha city, in the two days surrounding Biafra Remembrance Day in May 2016. \"This reckless and trigger-happy approach to crowd control has caused at least 150 deaths, and we fear the actual total might be far higher\" said Makmid Kamara, Amnesty's interim director for Nigeria. Other victims detailed in the report include a 26-year-old man who was shot in Nkpor, but hid in a gutter, still alive. He said when soldiers found him, they poured acid over him, and told him he would die slowly. Another woman said she had been speaking to her husband on a mobile phone when he told her he had been shot in the abdomen. He was calling from a military vehicle, she said, and she heard gunshots. She later found his body in a morgue with two more wounds in his chest, leading her to believe he had been executed after the call. 'Unimaginable atrocities' The human rights organisation said pro-Biafra protests had been \"largely peaceful\" despite occasional incidents of protesters throwing stones and burning tyres - and one occasion when someone shot at police. \"Regardless, these acts of violence and disorder did not justify the level of force used against the whole assembly.\" But army spokesman Sani Usman that \"the military and other security agencies exercised maximum restraints despite the flurry of provocative and unjustifiable violence\". The two main secessionist groups in the south-east, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, had committed \"unimaginable atrocities\", he said. This included burning and killing people from other parts of Nigeria and forcing them to flee, Col Usman added. In the past year there has been a series of protests to demand the creation of the state of Biafra in the south-east, home to the Igbo people. Prominent IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu has been detained without trial since October 2015, with the government defying a court order to release him. Analysis: Martin Patience, BBC News, Lagos The mention of Biafra continues to trigger powerful emotions in Nigeria - and memories of the country's darkest chapter. In 1967, nationalists attempted to create the independent state of Biafra in the south-east. It was to be a homeland for the Igbo people, one of the country's largest ethnic groups. But the bid for independence plunged the nation into a three-year civil war that killed at least a million people. Almost 50 years on and the bitterness of that period still lingers. Many Igbos claim they are still being punished for the conflict. In the past year that anger has manifested itself in a younger generation who have staged a wave of protests, fuelled, in part, by high unemployment and anger about official corruption - issues that are hardly unique to the Igbos. But IPOB appears to have gained momentum after the Nigerian authorities detained Mr Kanu, accusing him of treason. It is this heavy-handed approach, say human rights groups, that is inflaming the tensions.", "summary": "Dans un rapport publié mercredi dans la soirée, Amnesty International a accusé les forces de sécurité du Nigeria, notamment l'armée, d'avoir tué au moins cent cinquante manifestants pacifiques entre août 2015 et août 2016."}

Around the new arrivals, fragments of aluminium thermal blankets flutter in the air, buffeted by the winds they faced on their crossing from Libya. Almost 13,000 have landed in Italy so far this year; three times more than the same period in 2020. And more than 500 have died - a four-year high. Appeals falling on deaf ears \"This is a matter of responsibility of the European Union,\" says Marta Bernardini from the NGO Mediterranean Hope. The Italian government has called for solidarity from its EU partners, with the interior minister urging \"structural changes\" to migrant management within the bloc. For now, it's falling on deaf ears; Austria has already ruled out accepting any of the recent arrivals from Lampedusa. The uptick has once again filled the island's migrant camp, which was designed to hold fewer than 300. It now has five times that number, with dozens more held outside on the dusty road. Most are barefoot, using whatever they can find to take shelter from the sun. Police stop us from talking to them. But through the fence of the camp, Hidaya Ahmed from Nigeria was keen to talk. \"I want to work, I want to feed my family, they are dying,\" says Hidaya. \"I lost about four sisters, all because of hunger. Then we came to Libya and they put us in prison for three months. They treated us like slaves - sometimes they gave us money, sometimes nothing.\" She tells me she paid smugglers 8,000 Libyan dinars (£1,300; $1,800) for the three-day boat crossing to Lampedusa. Italian intelligence reportedly estimate that 50-70,000 people may be on Libya's shores waiting to take a similar journey. Another woman, Shantleen from Cameroon, says she did not intend to leave Libya, where she had a restaurant, but robbers came to her home, stole everything she had and raped her. She breaks down in tears as she shows her hand, which she says was injured in the attack. \"I'm sorry,\" she says, \"I don't want to talk about what happened in Libya. I don't know where I want to go to, I just need help. Wherever they want to keep me is fine. What I need is help.\" Does she believe Europe will want her, I ask, given that she arrived through illegal passage. \"Let them say that I came in an illegal way,\" she replies \"but if they ask me and hear my story, they will understand my pain.\" Most of the migrants here arrive from countries that don't qualify for asylum. Those whose claims are rejected are in theory deported, but it's not clear how many are really being sent back. 'It's time to say enough' Lampedusa and its population of around 6,000 have shown immense resilience and, for the most part, hospitality over years of migratory pressure. At the height of the EU's migrant crisis in 2015, some 20,000 landed on its shores. But, for some, patience has run out. In the European elections two years ago, the far-right, anti-immigrant League party of Matteo Salvini garnered almost half the votes on the island. It is part of the new national unity government, which is being strained by the recent arrivals. As a tug boat brings in another group of migrants picked up nearby, Atillio Lucia, a representative of the League, stands at the port shouting abuse and expletives. \"It's time to say enough after 30 years,\" he tells me later. \"I want the migrant camp to be closed immediately and a naval blockade so they can't access the island. The European Union adopted what it called a \"migration pact\" last autumn, which included plans for more assistance to countries of origin in return for better policing of their borders. Some here are calling for a financial package for Libya to stop the boats, in the style of the EU's €3bn deal with Turkey in 2016, which massively reduced crossings to Greece. Until a solution can be found to halt the traffickers, this tiny, rocky island will wait to see whether the recent arrivals are just a temporary spike - or whether a hot summer awaits on the horizon.

Authorities said the former president, and others charged by the ICC, should appear before the court. The commitment came at peace talks between Sudan's government and rebel groups from the Darfur region. \"Justice cannot be achieved if we don't heal the wounds,\" said Mohammed Hassan al-Taishi, a spokesman for the Sudanese government. He told BBC Focus on Africa radio that Bashir and three others would be handed over to the ICC. Asked if supporters of the ousted president would accept this decision, Mr Taishi replied that no-one was above justice. \"We are doing what the Sudanese people asked us to do,\" he added. Mr Taishi stressed that he was expressing the view of the government, which includes powerful generals in the military, and not his personal view. Mr Taishi is a civilian member of Sudan's sovereign council, the body overseeing the country's transition to democracy. A step towards peace? By Mohanad Hashim, BBC Sudan analyst The Sudanese delegation negotiating with rebels in Darfur has made a key concession to victims of the Darfur conflict by agreeing that all those wanted by the ICC should be handed over to the court to stand trial. The surrender of former President Bashir is, in fact, something that Sudan's top military general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan alluded to at a meeting in December with victims of the conflict. But there is no guarantee that it will happen - the generals may renege on the deal. If it does happen, it is unlikely to be anytime soon, as talks to end the conflict still have a long way to go and the transfer of the wanted men - from both sides of the conflict - would have to be part of a broader peace deal. Bashir, who refused to recognise the authority of the court when he was charged for crimes in the region in 2009, was ousted as president in April last year. On Tuesday, one of his lawyers told Reuters news agency that Bashir would continue to refuse to deal with the ICC, describing it as a \"political court\". ICC prosecutors in The Hague requested that the former leader stand trial over the Darfur killings and issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN says that in addition to those killed in fighting between local armed groups, and Bashir's forces and government-backed militia - such as the infamous Janjaweed - around 2.5 million people were displaced in the war. Warrants for Bashir's arrest were issued in 2009 and 2010 by the ICC. What is the ICC? The court investigates and brings to justice people suspected of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002, and has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. However, several countries - including China, India, Russia and the US - have refused to join, while some African countries say the court is unfairly focused on Africans. The international court has been criticised in the past for securing too few convictions, mishandling cases and over-reaching its jurisdiction. Bashir, 76, came to power in a military coup in 1989 and ruled Sudan with an iron fist. In December, he was sentenced to two years in a social reform facility for corruption. Under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms. Prosecutors in Sudan have also charged him with the killing of protesters during the demonstrations that led to him being ousted. Bashir denies all allegations against him.

Since then he has served as the UN special envoy for Syria, leading efforts to find a solution to the conflict. The career diplomat died in hospital in the Swiss city of Bern. He had been living near Geneva for several years. He \"passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness\", the Kofi Annan Foundation said. He was a \"deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world\", the statement added. Mr Guterres led the tributes to his predecessor. \"In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,\" he said in a statement. UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a tweet he was grief-stricken over Annan's death: Mr Obama, the first African American to win the White House, said: \"Long after he had broken barriers, Kofi never stopped his pursuit of a better world.\" President Putin said the memory of Annan would \"forever live in the hearts of Russians\". Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi said \"the world has lost not only a great African diplomat and humanitarian but also a conscience keeper of international peace and security\". Remembering Kofi Annan By Imogen Foulkes, BBC's UN reporter in Geneva Kofi Annan will be remembered for the way he drew attention, over and over again, to the plight of those caught up in war, environmental disaster, or simply grinding poverty. The way he quietly but firmly reminded world leaders, however powerful, that they needed to put their duty to their citizens above their political careers. Read more from Imogen UK PM Theresa May and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg were also among those who paid tributes. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo announced a week of national mourning, calling Annan \"one of our greatest compatriots\". Kofi Annan described his greatest achievement as the Millennium Development Goals, which - for the first time - set global targets on issues such as poverty and child mortality. The drive is widely regarded as a success. However, Annan was not immune from criticism. Some blamed him for the UN's failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s when he was head of the organisation's peacekeeping operations. He later clashed with America and the UK over the Iraq war after 2003, calling the US-led invasion illegal. But despite their past differences, former US President George W Bush was among those paying homage to Annan on Saturday, calling him \"a tireless leader of the United Nations\" whose \"voice of experience will be missed around the world\". After the invasion of Iraq, Annan and his son were accused of being involved in the \"oil for food corruption scandal\" that led some to call for his resignation, though he was later exonerated. The diplomat's career continued after retirement from the UN, and in 2007 he set up his own foundation aimed at promoting global sustainable development, security and peace. A year later, his reputation was boosted after he successfully helped negotiate a power-sharing deal to end post-election violence in Kenya. In a Facebook tribute, Raila Odinga, the opposition leader who signed the agreement, called Annan \"the man who stepped in and saved the country from collapse\". In an interview with the BBC's HardTalk to mark his 80th birthday in April, Annan acknowledged the UN's shortcomings, but said that \"if it didn't exist you would have to create it\". \"I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist,\" he added. In 2012 he was made chair of The Elders, a peace and human rights advocacy group started by South Africa's Nelson Mandela. The same year, he quit his post as UN envoy to Syria after only six months, citing the failures of world powers to fulfil their commitments.

Where is she?\" The congresswoman said it was a Capitol Police officer, but he looked at her with \"anger and hostility\" and did not identify himself as a member of law enforcement. Ms Ocasio-Cortez said she and her staff did not know whether the officer was there to \"help us, or hurt us\". Who is Ocasio-Cortez? Ms Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called Squad of young women lawmakers elected to office in 2018 amid a wave of Democratic victories. Their national profile rose in 2019 after Mr Trump told the four women, who are all ethnic minorities, to \"go back\" to where they were from in a comment largely condemned as racist. She has become a high-profile target of conservative media and Republicans in Congress. Last July, she accused a Republican senator of using sexist language against her during a heated exchange in the halls of the Capitol. One of the rioters apologised last week for tweeting \"Assassinate AOC\" as the violence was still unfolding. \"While I never intended to harm Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez nor harm any members of the Capitol police force, I recognise that my social media posts were completely inappropriate,\" said Texas man Garret Miller, who is facing four federal charges. What else did she say? Her comments come as former-President Trump faces an impeachment trial in the Senate for having allegedly incited an insurrection by giving a speech to the mob approximately an hour before the violence began. Republicans say Democrats are preventing the country from healing by seeking to cast blame on Mr Trump. In her Instagram video, Ms Ocasio-Cortez denounced people who are \"constantly trying to tell you that you didn't experience what you experienced or that you're lying.\" \"There's the trauma of going through what you went through,\" she said, \"and then there's the trauma afterwards of people not believing you, or trying to publicly humiliate you, or trying to embarrass you. \"And that also gets internalised, too, because a lot of times you don't want to believe it either.\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said she was prepared for criticism after sharing her sexual assault ordeal because it was not directly related to the Capitol riot. \"People are going to say that, 'Oh, she's just trying to make it about her,'\" she said. But all of your traumas can intersect and interact, she added. She said Congress had made counsellors available for lawmakers, especially those who had encountered rioters, in order to help them process the ordeal. \"Those folks who are just trying to tell us to move on are just like pulling the page, they're using the same tactics of every other abuser who just tells you to move on,\" she said.", "summary": "La politicienne démocrate américaine Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez affirme être une survivante d'une agression sexuelle."}

The rebel attack in Beni started on Saturday afternoon and lasted for several hours. Eighteen people died including 14 civilians, the army says. Local sources say the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist militant group active in the area since the 1990s, was behind the attack, but this has not been confirmed. Representatives from aid agencies working on the Ebola response are meeting to assess whether to increase security measures in Beni, reports the BBC's Louise Dewast in the capital, Kinshasa. Some residents of Beni have taken to the streets to protest against the security problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) had warned in August that insecurity in the region could affect the Ebola response. At the time, the WHO's Peter Salama described it as a \"dreaded\" scenario.

So where have these attacks taken place and why are health professionals being targeted? The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks attacks on health workers and healthcare facilities. This year, DR Congo experienced the most with 174, compared with 41 in Afghanistan and 35 in Syria. These include attacks on medical centres, health workers, patients and transportation. The WHO says five deaths have been recorded this year, with 51 injuries sustained. Threats and attacks vary from the throwing of stones at health workers to medical buildings being attacked and burnt down. Why are Ebola workers being attacked? There is evidence of a lack of trust among local populations with regard to the advice provided about the Ebola outbreak and the intentions of the foreign aid workers. A 2018 study published in the Lancet medical journal says \"belief in misinformation was widespread\" concerning the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu. One in four respondents believed in the statement that Ebola does not exist, with an even higher proportion saying the Ebola outbreak was fabricated for financial gains, or to destabilise the region. \"There's already been civil unrest in the region and that's exacerbated when a foreign response comes into an area that's heavily guarded,\" says Lara Salahi, an author who has written about responses to Ebola outbreaks. In North Kivu, community-based militia groups called Mai-Mai, have been behind some of the attacks against health centres and workers. Another militia group, the Allied Defence Forces (Ugandan rebels operating within DR Congo) have also been accused of causing widespread disruption to medical units. There have also been a series of attacks by other unidentified groups on Ebola response centres. In one incident, family members assaulted health workers who were overseeing the burial of their relative last month. International aid agencies have acknowledged their failure to gain the trust of local populations and, given the highly insecure environment, the level of community mistrust is understandable. \"What we know is that the actors of the Ebola response - MSF included - have failed to gain the trust of a significant part of the population,\" said Meinie Nicolai, MSF's director general in February. The MSF says in an atmosphere where rumours and misinformation are widespread, people can be hesitant about accepting help and taking action to tackle the virus.

Why did her daughter, so vibrant and healthy, suddenly become so unwell? What was causing the asthma attacks and seizures? \"She was sitting there and she would suddenly have an attack and I wanted to know why? If your asthma is that bad, someone should be able to tell a parent, what is triggering it.\" The next 10 days may finally give her some answers, but it will be a terrible ordeal. \"I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it all but I will somehow,\" she says. \"I've held my promise to my late daughter to try to find out why she became so ill.\" Rosamund will have to recall in detail the three years that her daughter was unwell. The times - she's lost count of how many - that Ella lay lifeless in the house and she had to resuscitate her. The blue-light ambulance journeys, almost 30 of them, to five different hospitals across London. Seeing her child's slender body hooked to a ventilator four times; being advised by doctors to try to talk to her through the induced comas, to help her recover. Ella died in February 2013. The cause given on the death certificate was acute respiratory failure. The inquest in 2014 concluded it had perhaps been triggered by \"something in the air\". Until that time no-one had talked about air pollution as a cause of Ella's illness and Rosamund says she became determined to find out what that \"something\" was. Rosamund's tone is amiable, she laughs frequently, but it is also forceful and insistent. She used to be head of sixth form at a London school, teaching psychology and philosophy. Sometimes she can be quite intelligent, she says with a cackle. She was born in North London, but she describes her children as being \"born and bred in Lewisham\" in south-east London. Ella was the eldest of three. The twins are now 13. They still live in the same house and they like to keep her room as it was, with planes stuck on the wall and the ceiling painted blue like the sky, because the children's big sister wanted to be a pilot in the RAF. On a nice day they cycle up to the cemetery to think about her. \"They hate it when Ella is called 'tragic',\" says Rosamund. \"She was not. She was very wise.\" Gifted - remarkable - exceptional. These are words that could be applied to Ella by anyone, not just a proud parent. Ella was in the top 10% of her school and by the time she was nine years old she had a reading age of 14. In the weeks before she died she was devouring Jane Eyre. \"She loved mental games,\" says Rosamund. Her favourite was chess, and few could beat her at Connect 4. \"She would pretend not to see a pattern and then when she felt you were getting too far ahead she would beat you.\" She played almost a dozen musical instruments and was an excellent swimmer. She was also very caring. \"Reading and writing came naturally to her. So when she met a child that couldn't read or write - as long as the teacher allowed it - after finishing her own work, Ella would sit with her and try to help her.\" During her many spells in hospital she didn't want to sit on her bed and \"vegetate.\" She convinced her doctors to let her go to school with a bandage tied over the cannula in her hand. She was given the teaching she craved, but the more carefree things, like PE, or going for sleepovers, were out of bounds. She would wake up on the ward, her mother would arrive to take her to school and, at the end of the day, would take her back to her hospital bed. \"How she fought,\" Rosamund says. \"Goodness me, she really did fight. And if she can fight and she was so young, she definitely inspired me. I still hear her voice, and many of our conversations. She always wanted to know why she had become so ill. She used to ask me.\" Their house - she doesn't want to reveal the address - was just a few dozen metres from the South Circular, one of London's most notoriously congested roads. School was a half-hour walk away, mostly on the pavement beside nose-to-tail traffic. The first time she knew something was wrong was when Ella was seven. It was 2010, October half term. \"We were doing the Great Fire of London at school and we went to see the Monument. Ella had a cold and she was climbing up the stairs. I remember her voice saying to me, 'I can no longer climb,' and me saying, as mothers do, 'You've only got a cold, what's stopping you?' I still feel really bad about that.\" Ella, a child with as much determination as her mother, got to the top. But on the train home, unusually, she fell fast asleep. Not long afterwards she developed a cough with a specific sound, like a smoker's cough. A few weeks later, just after Christmas, doctors put her in a coma for the first time.\" The next 28 months were worse than anyone can imagine, Rosamund says. Ella had tests for cystic fibrosis and epilepsy, eventually getting a diagnosis of severe asthma. In the beginning Ella didn't know how ill she was, Rosamund says, but as time went on, she realised. \"I'm still incredibly sad about how much she suffered,\" she says. \"She suffered greatly. That is something I cannot erase from my memory at all.\" The seizures happened most often at night. She would stop breathing. Rosamund would have to use what she calls \"magical skills\" - resuscitation - to keep her daughter alive until the ambulance got there. \"I learned from the first time that screaming and running around was not going to help her. The hospital trained me. Maybe it is a skill we should all acquire. It's something I hope never to have to use again.\" Ella was treated in Lewisham Hospital, King's College Hospital, Great Ormond Street, St George's, St Thomas's. She regularly spent 14 days at a time being given intravenous antibiotics. She took steroids and always carried inhalers. \"There was one time when she was in intensive care, and the doctor said we have done everything we can now, it's up to her to fight back,\" Rosamund says. \"There's this hopelessness as a parent, when everything has been done. There's nothing you can do, and you just sit by their bed. One thing the doctors said to do is to talk to her. I don't know how we got through it. Afterwards, we never spoke about it.\" Rosamund remembers the last evening they spent together at home in the sitting room. \"Her last night was Valentine's night. The final thing I read to her was Beethoven's Love Letters,\" she says. A few hours later she stopped breathing and Rosamund made what would be the final 999 call. Ella had a seizure in the ambulance and died in hospital in the early hours of 15 February 2013. \"I read the last one of those love letters at her funeral. You know the one that goes 'Ever thine ever mine'… I don't ever look it up now. I can't.\" Rosamund asked Great Ormond Street to take tissue samples of her daughter's body \"from top to toe\". She still isn't sure why she did it. \"It makes me sound like I'm really bright,\" she laughs. \"But there were just so many questions. I think it was because I'd heard about bodies having to be exhumed and I didn't want that to happen.\" She got legal advice and spoke to anyone who would listen - and listened to anyone who could help. In 2015, Prof (now Sir) Stephen Holgate, a government adviser and one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, read an article about Ella, and got in touch. Rosamund gave him access to the tissue samples and he considered Ella's medical records. This enabled him to confirm the type and severity of Ella's asthma. He examined all the data, including readings from pollution monitors close to the family home, and concluded that there was a direct link between Ella's condition and levels of toxic gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and harmful airborne particles. Unknown to the residents of Lewisham, on the night she died this part of London was covered by an invisible, but dense, poisonous mist of traffic fumes and other pollutants. There was, Stephen Holgate wrote a \"real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died.\" \"I was very angry when I read that report,\" says Rosamund. \"No-one had ever said anything to us about pollution before. We were looking for a medical answer. And this was an environmental answer. But he said he was 97% certain. And he's been doing this for 40 years.\" It was very hard to break the news to the twins, she says. And it has left her fearful: whenever one of them coughs, it sets off an alarm bell. The fresh inquest will look at all the evidence, including Stephen Holgate's report, and decide whether illegal levels of pollution killed their sister. It will also look at whether the central and local government should have been doing more to keep the people of Lewisham safe. The government estimates the number of people killed by long-term exposure to air pollution in the UK to be as high as 30,000 a year. However, no direct link to an individual death has ever been made. Is it little Ella who will provide one? Rosamund stresses that she isn't trying to blame the original coroner or any of the healthcare professionals who cared for her daughter. She also doesn't want to predict what the ruling will be. However, it's no secret what result she and her team want. If Ella becomes the first person - perhaps in the world - whose cause of death is listed as air pollution, it could lead to seismic change. Article two of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to life. Ella could set a precedent, helping those forced to breathe unlawful levels of dirty air to hold the authorities to account, and demand action. What's been called the \"invisible killer\" has also been legally invisible, Rosamund's lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn says. This inquest could make it impossible to ignore. When the coroner has made his decision, when the media interviews have been done, when the lawyers have gone home, what then? For Rosamund, the sadness will remain. \"I look at what her siblings are doing, and I realise what she has missed,\" she says. \"Even if we get the verdict we would like to get, there is no happy ever after is there? Because we will not get her back.\" Will they move? She will talk to the twins, she says, and she will see how bad the traffic is, though as a full-time campaigner now, rather than a teacher, she's not sure they would be able to afford it. \"But if we have to move we will damn well move.\" She wants to thank the people who write to her, telling her about their experiences. They encourage her to carry on. Just as Ella herself did. \"She didn't want to be forgotten by her siblings and her friends. She was only here for a short while but I hope she's left her mark. She's brought about discussion [and shown] it can happen to anyone. \"And if we get the result we want, my other daughter is going to say, 'Unless you do something mum, other children are going to die.'\" You may also be interested in: Every year, mental health trusts spend millions of pounds employing lawyers to represent them at inquests, where they could be found to be at fault.

Their widely shared tweets went viral, garnering thousands of responses. Farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders against new farm laws. In a statement on Wednesday, India's external affairs ministry said parliament had passed \"reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector\" after a full debate and discussion. \"The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,\" it added. Rihanna's tweet on Tuesday linked to a news story about the internet blockade at the protest sites. India suspended mobile internet services in three areas around the capital, Delhi, where tens of thousands of farmers are camping to protest against the new laws. The government said the shutdown was to \"maintain public safety\". The protest made international headlines last week when a tractor rally by farmers ended in violent clashes that left one protester dead and more than 500 police injured, according to the authorities. Some demonstrators stormed Delhi's historic Red Fort and occupied it until police pushed them back. Farmers' groups and union leaders condemned the violence but said they would not call off the protest. The pop superstar's tweet to her 101 million followers sent her name to the top of social media trends in India. Her post drew a global outpouring of support. There were many who also criticised the singer for wading into the protests against the laws that have been defended by the government and its supporters. Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut, a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), posted a message quoting the tweet. \"No one is talking about it because they are not farmers, they are terrorists who are trying to divide India,\" she wrote.

British MP Claudia Webbe also expressed her support for the farmers, writing, \"Thank you Rihanna. In an era where political leadership is lacking, we are grateful for others stepping forward.\" The farmers' protest, now in its third month, presents the biggest challenge Mr Modi has faced. His BJP government has offered to suspend the laws but the farmers want them repealed. The authorities are extremely sensitive to criticism and, on Monday, Twitter restored dozens of Indian accounts that were earlier blocked after a legal notice by the government, citing objections based on public order. The accounts included those of farmers' leaders, activists and a respected news magazine. The contentious farm laws loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce which have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. Farmers fear that the new laws will threaten decades-old concessions - such as assured prices - and weaken their bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private companies.", "summary": "L'Inde accuse des \"étrangers\" et des célébrités de \"sensationnalisme\" après qu'un tweet de la superstar de la pop Rihanna, qui apporte son soutien aux agriculteurs protestataires, a attiré l'attention du monde entier."}

The financial toll was a major issue, after lockdowns damaged economies worldwide. Poorer countries and younger people say they are facing the greatest hardship. A drop in income was reported by 69% of respondents in poorer countries, in comparison to 45% in richer ones, the poll found. Outcomes also differed along race and gender lines, with women worse off than men, and black people reporting higher levels of Covid-19 infection than white people in the US. The research was conducted for the BBC World Service in 27 countries by GlobeScan in June 2020, the height of the pandemic in many places. In total, more than 27,000 people were surveyed about Covid-19 and the impact it has had on their lives. \"One of the central narratives of this pandemic has been that 'we are all in this together',\" Chris Coulter, the chief executive of GlobeScan, told the BBC. \"Our poll finds that the opposite is true. Across different countries and within most countries, results show that those who are most systemically disadvantaged have been hit the hardest.\" An unequal world The pandemic has had a more severe impact on people in poorer countries and has exacerbated existing inequalities, the poll found. There was a notable divide between countries among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-member countries. The OECD is an international group of 37 countries that are among the world's most prosperous economies. The poll shows that 69% of people in non-OECD countries had their income affected due to the pandemic, compared to 45% of those living in OECD countries. Overall, the research found that people in Latin America, Asia and Africa were more likely to say the virus had had a considerable impact on them than those living in Europe and North America. People in Kenya (91%), Thailand (81%), Nigeria (80%), South Africa (77%), Indonesia (76%), and Vietnam (74%) were most likely to have been affected financially. People on low incomes in those countries were most likely to say they now had even less money. But counter-intuitively, people with high incomes in Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, and the UK were more likely to have been impacted financially by the pandemic than those earning the least. A generational divide The pandemic has opened up a gulf between young and old, according to the poll. Younger generations say they have experienced a tougher time than older generations. This might be because there have been fewer opportunities to work, socialise and seek education during the pandemic. Some 55% of respondents from Gen Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s) and 56% of Millennials (people born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s) feel the pandemic has greatly affected their lives. In contrast, only 49% of those from Gen X (people born from 1965 to 1980) and 39% of Baby Boomers (people born from 1946 to 1964) said they felt the same. Gen Z respondents suffered the worst financial hit, with 63% saying they saw a change to their incomes. Conversely, only 42% of Baby Boomers said their incomes were affected. Older generations are also more likely to have escaped physical or financial harm. Some 56% of Baby Boomers and older reported no physical or financial impacts, compared to 39% on average globally.

To really know that, we'd have to watch how cases change in one place across the year. But we can look at its spread in different climates across the world for clues. What's the evidence? There is some evidence coronavirus cases have particularly clustered around cooler, drier regions. One study indicated countries particularly affected by the virus - those where it was spreading undetected via community transmission - by 10 March had lower average temperatures than those with fewer cases. Another paper looked at 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases of Covid-19 and suggested the higher the temperature and humidity, the lower the rate of transmission. And another, not yet peer-reviewed, study suggested that although cases of the new coronavirus could be found all over the world, outbreaks had particularly clustered in \"relatively cool and dry areas\" - at least until 23 March. But, as a group of researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pointed out, the virus has now spread to every World Health Organization region, \"effectively spanning all climatic zones, from cold and dry to hot and humid regions\". Is there a north-south divide? With lots of other viruses, including flu, a seasonal pattern is seen in the northern and southern hemispheres. But tropical regions close to the equator don't experience the same pattern. And some of the hot and humid regions that have seen locally transmitted cases of the Covid-19 virus, such as Malaysia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are close to the equator and so might not provide the best evidence for what will happen elsewhere. But looking to the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand - at the tail-end of their summer season when their first cases were seen - have had far fewer cases than many of their northern-hemisphere counterparts. There are lots of other factors at play, such as global footfall and the density of the population. And since the virus has gradually spread around the world - initially through global travel - at the same time as seasons have been changing, it's difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate specifically. Are other coronaviruses seasonal? There is some evidence other coronaviruses mainly circulate in the winter months, according to a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The researchers asked almost 2,000 people for a weekly report on whether anyone in their household had symptoms of respiratory illness. And anyone with symptoms was asked to send in a swab for testing for a range of viruses. From this, the researchers observed large peaks in coronavirus cases in the winter, around the same time as flu season. There were a small number of cases in the summer. One of the study's authors, Ellen Fragaszy, at UCL said it was therefore \"possible we will see a bit of a relief in cases over the summer\". But we could not be sure this is how the new coronavirus would behave. And the large number of cases and their spread across the world suggested we shouldn't be too hopeful of a summer respite. Is this virus like other coronaviruses? The new coronavirus, called Sars-Cov-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, appears to spread in basically the same way as other coronaviruses. But what makes it distinct is the how ill it makes you and the number of deaths it causes. Dr Michael Head, at the University of Southampton, said the development and impact of the novel coronavirus was \"clearly very different from the existing 'common cold' type coronaviruses\". \"It remains to be seen as to whether Covid-19 cases will decline in response to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity,\" he said.

You do not have to walk far in Los Angeles to see people sleeping rough. Many spend their nights in temporary shelters, or other places not meant for human habitation - on the street, in an abandoned building, or a transport hub. The number of homeless people in Los Angeles has grown by 33% over the past four years. Every night, nearly 60,000 Los Angeles County residents are homeless, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority has found. A total of 85% of Los Angeles's homeless people are adults without children, 70% are male, and 44% are black, even though they account for only 8% of Los Angeles residents. And Los Angeles has the largest number in the United States of homeless people who do not sleep in emergency shelters: What are the key causes? Money is at the root of the city's homeless crisis - jobs that pay too little and housing that costs too much. Half of homeless people say they do not have housing because they lost their jobs and cannot pay rent. Only 21% of new homeless people in the city report having a mental disability compared with 55% of those who have been homeless for longer, suggesting rates of mental illness go up as people are homeless for longer. Blue-collar workers in Los Angeles were able to earn middle-class wages and buy homes until the Cold War ended, nearly 30 years ago. The government cutting back on military expenditure meant the national defence industry, which was centred in Los Angeles, shrank by more than half. Well paid jobs were replaced by minimum-wage jobs. Selected statistics 2018 10,105,518Population 3,295,198Households $61,015Median annual household income 2013-17 $1,322Median monthly gross rent 2013-17 52,765Homeless people Little new housing - especially lower-cost rental housing - has been built over the past 30 years, even though Los Angeles's population has grown by 15%. The result has been steady rent increases that have made housing unaffordable for many working-poor families. Only a small percentage of housing is subsidised by government. The vast majority of rental housing is privately owned and rents are set at the free-market rate. More than 780,000 people in Los Angeles spend more than 90% of their income on rent - and these precariously housed individuals are at high risk of homelessness. What is Skid Row? Homeless people are now seen in nearly all neighbourhoods and business districts throughout Los Angeles. This was not the case a decade ago, when most of the homeless population was contained in an area known as Skid Row. Skid Row is still a 1-sq-km (250-acre) area located only 500m east of City Hall, although it is no longer as tightly contained as it used to be. In 1976, city officials established Skid Row as an unofficial \"containment zone\", where homeless people, shelters and services would be tolerated. As a result, most visitors to the parts of Los Angeles that attracted visitors from around the world never saw a homeless person. More like this The recession of 1981 saw soaring unemployment and the beginning of the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles. The number of homeless people in Skid Row grew beyond the capacity of shelters and even the streets to accommodate them. Many moved to other areas but generally ones out of view of the police. Outside Skid Row, police vigorously enforced the city's laws, making it a criminal offence to sit, lie down or sleep in a public space. Subsequent recessions and the ongoing loss of unskilled jobs spurred continuing growth in homelessness. What is happening elsewhere in the US? Although New York has more homeless people, it is the number not in emergency shelters that makes Los Angeles stand out. Only about one in seven homeless adults in Los Angeles has access to a temporary shelter bed - and one-fifth of all unsheltered homeless people in the United States live in Los Angeles County. Other major US cities have fewer homeless people on the streets because they provide more housing. For example in Boston, only 3% of homeless people are unsheltered and in New York only 5%. How do the people of Los Angeles feel about homelessness? The reaction of housed Angelenos has been mixed. On the one hand, in 2016 and 2017, voters overwhelmingly approved new taxes to pay for more housing and services for unhoused people. But there have been few visible signs of progress since then, in part because of homeowners not wanting homeless housing or services anywhere in their communities. One of the tax measures approved by voters provided $1.2bn (£964m) to build 10,000 housing units for homeless people. However, recent projections indicate it may be enough for only 7,000. Meanwhile, homelessness has continued to grow and both housed and unhoused residents are expressing frustration and anger. Organisations that serve homeless people are urging the public to be patient and to recognise housing and services need to be provided in every community. However, both the city and county of Los Angeles are considering legal measures to drastically limit where people can sleep to avoid arrest. Those working on behalf of homeless people say this would remove the only protection they have. An approach supported by both supporters of homeless people and labour unions is to address homelessness as an income problem rather than only a housing-supply problem and to provide jobs for employable adults. Work is being done to identify adults who will become long-term homeless. And they are given housing and trained for jobs that are held open for them. Los Angeles's spike in homelessness has been years in the making. The question is how quickly this tide can be turned and how.

At least 26 people are believed to have died in the current outbreak. Health workers were among the first to receive the vaccine on Monday. What is Ebola? It is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal. It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. More than 11,300 people died in the earlier outbreak in 2014-16. How serious is the current outbreak? At least 45 cases of Ebola have been reported, including three health workers, since the outbreak began earlier this month. The virus has already spread from rural areas to the north-western city of Mbandaka, a major transport hub on the River Congo, where at least four cases have been confirmed. This has sparked fears that the outbreak could reach the capital, Kinshasa, as well as neighbouring countries. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has \"strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control\". At an emergency meeting, on Friday WHO experts said that \"the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met\". What do we know about the medicine being used? The vaccine, made by pharmaceutical firm Merck, is not yet licensed, but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak. Dr Michel Yao, from the WHO, told the BBC that the vaccine had been tested in Guinea and that \"almost all of the people who were vaccinated could not get the disease\". The WHO has sent more than 4,000 doses to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with another batch set to follow. Health care providers and funeral workers are being vaccinated initially, before the programme is extended to more than 500 people who may have come into contact with those infected with the virus, in a so-called \"ring vaccination\". What are the challenges? One of the most immediate obstacles to the immunisation campaign is the country's unreliable electricity supplies, as the vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C. Initial stocks of the vaccine have arrived in Mbandaka city, but they must now be transported through densely forested areas to reach remote rural areas where many cases have been reported. A further issue is that, as the vaccine has not yet been approved, its use is dependent upon informed and signed consent from all patients. This means that translators will need to be brought in to aid communication between health workers and local communities. Life in the Ebola zone One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: \"I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?' \"They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear.\" Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. \"But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,\" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river.", "summary": "Les agents de santé en République démocratique du Congo (RDC) ont lancé une campagne de vaccination pour tenter d'enrayer la propagation d'une épidémie du virus Ebola."}

President al-Bashir himself took power following a military coup in 1989 and prior to that there had been many other coup attempts in Sudan, some successful and some not. Reality Check looks back at Sudan's history of military interventions, and the wider picture across the African continent. Sudan has had more coup attempts than any other country in Africa. Including this most recent intervention, there have been 15 - four of them successful. If the military succeeds in its ambition of permanently ousting Omar al-Bashir, this will be the fifth. When is a coup a coup? Since the 1950s, there've been a total of 206 coups attempts in Africa, according to a dataset compiled by two US political scientists, Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne. Their definition of a coup is that they are illegal and overt attempts by the military or other civilian officials inside the state to unseat sitting leaders. However, the definition of coup is often contested and in the past, military leaders have denied they were conducting them. Take, for example, Zimbabwe in 2017. The military mounted a takeover to put an end to Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule. At the time, a top military official, Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo, went on television to deny flatly that it was a military takeover. \"Coup leaders almost invariably deny their action was a coup in an effort to appear legitimate,\" says Powell. Powell and Thyne regard a successful coup as one that lasts longer than seven days. Excluding the latest one in Sudan, there have been 105 failed coups in Africa and 100 successful ones. Burkina Faso, in West Africa, has had the most successful ones, with seven. Is Africa having fewer military takeovers? Africa has certainly had a high number of military takeovers, but this particular way of forcing change is, in fact, declining. In the four decades between 1960 and 2000, the number of coup attempts remained remarkably consistent at around 40 per decade. Since then there's been a significant decline. In the 2000s there were 22 attempts, and in the current decade the number now stands at 17. Jonathan Powell says this is not surprising given the instability African countries experienced in the years after independence. \"African countries have had the conditions common for coups, like poverty and poor economic performance. When a country has one coup, that's often a harbinger of more coups.\" And historically in African countries, the military have generally played a more active role in transitions of power and domestic issues and security. Global picture Globally, the total number of coup attempts since 1952 stands at 476. Africa has experienced more coups than any other continent. Next is South America which has had 95 attempted coups, 40 of which were successful. Over the past two decades there has been a decline in the number of South American coup attempts. The last was in Venezuela in 2002, against President Hugo Chavez - which ended in failure. Powell says the end of Cold War dynamics which saw the US and Soviet Union meddle in Latin American affairs, as well as the willingness of the international community to sanction countries which have coups, like Haiti in 1994, has led to the decline of military takeovers.

It was thanks to his innovations - which included the \"cut\", \"copy\" and \"paste\" commands - that the personal computer became simple to learn and use. Xerox, where Mr Tesler spent part of his career, paid tribute to him. \"The inventor of cut/copy & paste, find & replace, and more, was former Xerox researcher Larry Tesler,\" the company tweeted. \"Your workday is easier thanks to his revolutionary ideas.\" Mr Tesler was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1945, and studied at Stanford University in California. After graduating, he specialised in user interface design - that is, making computer systems more user-friendly. He worked for a number of major tech firms during his long career. He started at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), before Steve Jobs poached him for Apple, where he spent 17 years and rose to chief scientist. After leaving Apple he set up an education start-up, and worked for brief periods at Amazon and Yahoo. In 2012, he told the BBC of Silicon Valley: \"There's almost a rite of passage - after you've made some money, you don't just retire, you spend your time funding other companies. \"There's a very strong element of excitement, of being able to share what you've learned with the next generation.\" 'A counterculture vision' Possibly Mr Tesler's most famous innovation, the cut and paste command, was reportedly based on the old method of editing in which people would physically cut portions of printed text and glue them elsewhere. The command was incorporated in Apple's software on the Lisa computer in 1983, and the original Macintosh that was released the following year. One of Mr Tesler's firmest beliefs was that computer systems should stop using \"modes\", which were common in software design at the time. Modes allow users to switch between functions on software and apps but make computers both time-consuming and complicated. So strong was this belief that Mr Tesler's website was called \"nomodes.com\", his Twitter handle was \"@nomodes\", and even his car's registration plate was \"No Modes\".

President-elect Joe Biden called it an \"insurrection\", while Vice-President Mike Pence said the violence had been a \"dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\". But this is not the first time the building - regarded as the symbolic heart of US democracy - has been hit by violence. From bombs to foreign invasions, here are four other times the Capitol was attacked. British forces try to burn it down - 1814 Perhaps the most famous attack was by British forces during the War of 1812. British troops, led by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross - set fire to the still-under-construction Capitol after invading Washington DC in August 1814 (though the building survived thanks to a downpour). In retaliation for the Americans' burning of Upper Canada's capital at York a year earlier, the British troops also set fire to other parts of the city and key buildings, including the White House. The 1814 attack marks the only time that a foreign power has captured and occupied Washington. In 2014, the British embassy in Washington apologised after tweeting a picture of a White House cake surrounded by sparklers, \"commemorating\" the burning of the building 200 years before. Fourth of July dynamite attack- 1915 A century on from the British attack, Erich Muenter, former professor of German at Harvard University, exploded three sticks of dynamite in the Senate reception room. The explosion damaged the building, but nobody was killed. Muenter later said the attack was in response to American financiers aiding Britain against Germany in World War I. Writing under a pseudonym in the Washington Evening Star, Muenter said he hoped the attack would \"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamour for war\", adding: \"This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace.\" A day after the attack, Muenter shot and injured financier JP Morgan Jr, before being subdued by Morgan's butler and arrested. He later took his own life. Attack by Puerto Rican nationalists - 1954 On 1 March 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out the island's flag and shouted \"Freedom for Puerto Rico\" as they opened fire from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives, injuring five congressmen. \"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\" cried the leader, Lolita Lebron, during her arrest. Lebron was sentenced to 50 years behind bars, while the three men were given 75 years. The sentences were all later commuted by President Jimmy Carter. His administration said the release \"would be a significant humanitarian gesture and would be viewed as such by much of the international community\". The group returned to cheering crowds in Puerto Rico. 'Resistance Conspiracy' bomb - 1983 On 7 November 1983, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the Senate. Just minutes before the explosion, someone claiming to be from a group named the Armed Resistance Unit called a Capitol switchboard warning of a pending attack, saying it was in retaliation for US military actions in Grenada and Lebanon. There were no casualties but there was some costly damage. In 1988, FBI agents arrested seven members of the radical-left Resistance Conspiracy group for the Capitol attack and separate blasts at Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard in 1983 and 1984.

The letter was signed \"By The Cyber Powers Vested In Me\". But the jokes have since subsided, and Zimbabweans are now considering what the new ministry will mean for their civil liberties - especially freedom of speech. 'A threat to the state' Zimbabwe's government has been uneasy about social media after pastor Evan Mawararire spearheaded the #ThisFlag movement last year. Using platforms like Twitter and Facebook it organised a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. President Robert Mugabe's spokesperson, George Charamba, says Mr Mugabe came up with the idea of a new ministry to deal with an \"emerging threat to the state... a threat founded on abuse and unlawful conduct\". Social media is possibly the primary platform Zimbabweans use to communicate and receive news. It is thriving despite restrictive laws governing freedom of expression. Over the last 16 years, internet usage in the country has grown from 0.3% penetration to 46%, data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) shows. Several TV stations and online publications, some operating from the diaspora, use the internet to disseminate news out of the reach of the government. When petrol stations ran out of fuel last month, there were dramatic scenes of long queues at supermarket as Zimbabweans stocked up, anticipating food shortages. Worried by these events, the government blamed social media messages for spreading panic. \"Social media was abused to create a sense of panic, thereby creating some sort of destabilising in the economy,\" says Mr Charamba. The new cyber security minister, Mr Chinamasa, agrees. He commented at the time, before his appointment, that \"the cause basically was social media\". \"It means it's a security issue,\" he adds. \"It is also a political agenda, a regime change agenda. We are going to look at what exactly happened with a view to take corrective measures in the security arena.\" 'Muzzling' opinion But others say the government's stance is a threat to civil liberties. One communications rights group, the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), says this new scrutiny of social media goes against the spirit of the constitution and freedom of expression. \"These unfortunate threats have resulted in self-censorship by [individuals] when engaging on topical issues affecting the country,\" it said in a statement. It also criticises censorship of Zimbabwe's media, \"who have on occasion been chastised for incorporating citizen opinion as expressed online in their reportage\". Going a step further, Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says the government's new cyber threat ministry is a means for government to spy on its people. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also believes that the ministry has been created to curb free speech in time for the 2018 polls. \"Mugabe... will do whatever it takes to control and muzzle social media in order to suppress public discontent against his regime,\" he said. \"However the good news is that the regime has no capacity to suppress the use of social media.\" Many Zimbabweans have reacted wryly to the news of the creation of a cyber minister, referring to Mr Chinamasa as the \"Minister of WhatsApp\". Some say the ridicule shows a lack of understanding about the global threat of cyber crime. Others see a link between the government's scrutiny of online communication and the forthcoming elections. Zimbabwe already has several pieces of legislation which rights groups say curb freedom of expression. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says that since 2010, it has assisted more than 100 people arrested under a law which makes it a jailable offence to \"insult the president\" and \"undermine his authority\". Ordinary people have been arrested and charged for calling the 93-year-old leader \"old\", \"a donkey\" and even for accusing him of ruining the country. The Zimbabwean government has said new legislation will not stifle freedom of expression and will protect the public from new threats such as revenge pornography and cyber attacks. Presidential spokesperson Mr Charamba says Zimbabwe will look closely at how other nations have dealt with the threat of cybercrime - including Russia, China, and South Korea \"who have faced similar challenges\". Arrests ahead? While several countries around the world have anti-cyber crime departments and agencies, Zimbabwe is among the first to create an entire ministry. Meanwhile on social media, ominous warnings have begun circulating. One is from a \"Mr Chaipa\", urging Zimbabweans only to share content on social media that they would be able to defend in court. Mr Chaipa said it was easy for the government to monitor online messages, and gave a list of online activities that could be classified as criminal offences. \"In the coming months a lot of people will be arrested and used as examples to deter people from 'abusing' social media towards the elections,\" he warns. \"Don't be made an example.\"", "summary": "Un faux communiqué gouvernemental est apparu sur les réseaux sociaux du Zimbabwe peu de temps après l'annonce par le président Robert Mugabe de la création d'un ministère de la cyber-sécurité."}

Instead, the 34-year-old ended up in a series of odd jobs earning the minimum wage to survive - a typical story for many young Nigerians who are just trying to get by. It was not until 2016 that online adverts for Bitcoin piqued his interest and he began his cryptocurrency journey. \"I started intensive research,\" Mr Fadugbagbe told the BBC. \"I was spending hours every day watching videos on YouTube and reading articles about Bitcoin. I didn't have much money so I started with $100 to $200.\" It was a decision that transformed his life. At the time that we spoke, Mr Fadugbagbe, who now trades full time and teaches budding investors, said he had cryptocurrency worth more than $200,000 (£140,000) in his possession. \"I'll soon be moving into my own house, which I'm building. I have a farm - a very big one - courtesy of cryptocurrency,\" he laughs gleefully, unencumbered by concerns that he could be inflating an investment bubble that will one day burst. \"No Nigerian comes to cryptocurrency and wants to look back. It's a big opportunity.\" Success stories like Mr Fadugbagbe's have attracted millions of Nigerians to digital currencies such as Bitcoin. A 2020 online survey by data platform Statista found that 32% of those Nigerians who took part used cryptocurrencies - the highest proportion of any country in the world. 2020 1.1mcryptocurrency trades per month in Nigeria on the Paxful platform $65mtraded every month $100was spent on each trade on average $215 was the average spent on each trade in the US Estimates show that of the top 10 countries for trading volumes, Nigeria ranked third place after the US and Russia in 2020, generating more than $400m worth of transactions. Although Nigeria has eased out of its second recession in less than five years, the challenging economic climate remains, making alternative sources of income and alternative currencies attractive. The Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the currency, the naira, by 24% last year. There are fears of a further fall in value by as much as 10% this year. Meanwhile prices continue to rise, with food inflation climbing to its highest point since July 2008. When Michael Ugwu, the founder of a media company in Lagos, sold land he owned in 2018, he realised he needed to explore new investment opportunities. Although his naira earnings had gone up, he was worse of in US dollar terms because of the devaluation. \"I'd made naira but lost US dollars. That's when I realised we're hustling backwards. It was then that I started to look into Bitcoin.\" The move to invest in digital currencies has paid off. \"On some of my currencies I've made 50 times what I invested. On Bitcoin it's easily grown 10 times in the last year,\" he says. The former banker sees cryptocurrency as an evolution of finance, describing it as \"finance 2.0\". Despite the currency's volatility, Mr Ugwu sees it as a valuable tool to \"hedge\" or reduce the risk of living in what he describes as a high-risk environment. 'Better banking experience' His wife Onyeka started to invest when faced with high commission charges to transfer cash between her Nigerian and British accounts. \"For me it's a banking system,\" she says. \"It wasn't about making money. It was about how [to] have a better banking experience. Look at it as saving your money in a currency that can keep the value of the money.\" Despite its appeal, economists around the world warn that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are high-risk investments. There are legitimate concerns that Bitcoin's soaring value is a speculative bet that will one day leave many in ruins. An international banker based in Nigeria, who asked to remain anonymous, says it is a financial product that carries significant potential regulatory risk. He says that \"governments and central banks have not decided whether they can, or should, regulate it\". \"On a technical level I'm not 100% sure that the security that it uses is entirely foolproof. I think there are still some technical uncertainties,\" he adds. In an effort to regulate the market, Nigeria's central bank banned banks from facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions in 2017, but the ban remained largely unenforced. Cryptocurrency ban However, this year the institution doubled down on its stance. In a statement released on 7 February it cited the need to protect the general public and safeguard the country from potential threats posed by \"unknown and unregulated entities\" that are \"well-suited for conducting many illegal activities\". Since then, many Nigerians have reported that their bank accounts have been frozen due to cryptocurrency-related activity. Mr Fadugbagbe's bank manager called to advise him that his account would be closed, giving him a day to transfer his funds. However, not everyone has been so fortunate. One source says his bank account was frozen two weeks ago with tens of thousands of naira in it. The software engineer says the bank would not disclose the reason for its actions. He suspects he was targeted for running a cryptocurrency remittance business. Furthermore, the BBC was shown a customer's bank correspondence, which contains the warning: \"We strongly advise that you do not use your account for cryptocurrency-related activities so you don't get into trouble with the law\". However many investors with the possibility say they will continue to trade using their overseas bank accounts. They say they can easily revert to peer-to-peer transactions. This means that rather than transferring funds between a financial institution and a cryptocurrency online trading platform, investors transfer funds directly to each other or through a middle person as they buy and sell. 'Don't shut it off completely' This is the method the cryptocurrency community used before the development of the virtual currency marketplace ecosystem in Nigeria. Mr Ugwu has also heard many in the business of cryptocurrency talk of relocating to potentially more hospitable environments such as Ghana, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The concerns of the authorities when it comes to cryptocurrencies being used for illegal purposes are legitimate but some argue that they are being too heavy handed. A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Kingsley Moghalu, believes that the country should engage and manage the risks \"rather than just shutting it off completely - especially to the extent that it provides livelihoods for many people in a depressed economy\". There are also fears that cryptocurrency could become a missed opportunity, according to Gbite Oduneye who heads EGM Group, a Lagos-based brokerage firm. \"Nigeria is the third largest place for cryptocurrency trade in terms of volume,\" he explains. \"If you don't take advantage, someone else will. Build an ecosystem round it. Put in rules and regulations.\" 'I trust cryptocurrency more than shares' Nigerians also see cryptocurrencies as a way to get around foreign currency restrictions. \"There are a lot of restrictions on what we can and cannot do with our foreign exchange,\" Nena Nwachukwu from popular trading platform Paxful explains. \"Nigerians find it easier to use [cryptocurrency] as an investment tool.\" She saw awareness of their service grow in October 2020 during the #EndSars protests against police brutality. Attempts to crack down on the organisers by freezing their bank accounts led to the increased use of digital currencies, which saw Bitcoin trend on Twitter. Ms Nwachukwu says this resulted in a wave of new sign ups and an increase in transactions. At the heart of the rise of Bitcoin is a distrust of centralised financial systems and top-down economic control, investors say. Many express their frustrations with government policy and the decline of the Nigerian economy. None more so than Mr Fadugbagbe, who spent years struggling to scrape by as what he describes as a \"minimum-wage slave\". \"I don't do shares and government bonds\", he says. \"Those are scams. I trust cryptocurrency more.\" Clarification 1 March 2021: This article has been amended to make it clear that the Statista survey of Nigerians was carried out online, and so does not reflect the whole population.", "summary": "Le commerce des cryptomonnaies est plus important au Nigeria que presque partout ailleurs dans le monde, ce qui reflète une perte de confiance dans les formes d'investissement plus traditionnelles, comme le rapporte Ijeoma Ndukwe."}

Chief executive Alan Joyce said many governments were talking about vaccination as \"a condition of entry\". Even if they weren't, he thought the airline should enforce its own policy. \"We have a duty of care to our passengers and to our crew, to say that everybody in that aircraft needs to be safe,\" Mr Joyce said. He believes that would justify changing the terms and conditions on which tickets are booked. And Mr Joyce thinks passengers would be willing to accept the change. \"The vast majority of our customers think this is a great idea - 90% of people that we've surveyed think it should be a requirement for people to be vaccinated to travel internationally.\" But some powerful voices are among those who disagree, including the World Health Organisation. Its director of digital health and innovation, Bernardo Mariano, told the BBC: \"We don't approve the fact that a vaccinations passport should be a condition for travel.\" He added that - regardless of what the private sector wanted - a unified approach from governments would be needed to make such a change work. Managing virus risk Aviation is vital to the global economy. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that it supports $1.8 trillion (£1.3tn, A$2.3tn) in global economic activity. But government restrictions and fears of catching coronavirus have led to an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers in an industry which carried 4.5 billion people in 2019. Australia's government has closed its borders to almost all foreigners and has also periodically closed internal borders. Even with vaccines, Mr Joyce thinks that \"once we open up our international borders, we're going to have the virus circulating\". \"And that's going to be a big change for a lot of Australia, to find that acceptable,\" he said. \"We need people to understand they can't have zero risk with this virus. We manage risk in so many different other ways for other parts of life.\" Pandemic losses The lack of passengers means that in the last six months of 2020 Qantas lost $800m (£580m, A$1.03bn). That compares with a profit of $596m (£430m, A$771m) in the same period of 2019. It's also meant 8,500 job cuts from a pre-pandemic staff of about 29,000. And thousands of others are on furlough, with the Australian government paying their wages. Other international carriers have seen similar reversals in their fortunes. In response, airlines have cut their capacity, with huge numbers of aeroplanes put into storage. For Qantas that was about two-thirds of their 314 aircraft. Among them are the airline's fleet of giant, double-decker Airbus A380s, one of which was being refurbished when the pandemic took hold. It \"went from Dresden in Germany where the reconfig took place straight to the Mojave Desert, and nobody sat on those seats\", Mr Joyce said. Qantas says vaccines will be required to fly Having less supply of any product normally means that prices climb in response to an increase in demand. However, Mr Joyce doesn't think the combination of fewer seats and the easing of restrictions will lead to higher prices. \"In some cases, we think the airfares could be half of what they were pre-Covid,\" he said. \"And that will be there to stimulate demand.\" It could be that way for some time. \"Internationally it's going to take a while for it to recover to 2019 levels,\" the airline boss said. When flights do get going again, the priority will be bringing money in and any surge in demand can be dealt with by bringing more aircraft back into service. \"So we're very confident that it's not going to be higher airfares,\" Mr Joyce insisted. Boost to ultra-long haul Last month Qantas pushed back the date at which it expects its international flights to resume from July to the end of October. That's the point at which the Australian government hopes to have vaccinated all adults and the date for which the airline is now selling international tickets. \"The number one flight by a significant amount is Perth to London non-stop,\" says Mr Joyce. The demand for the ultra-long haul flights is, he says, \"a good indication\" that after pandemic passengers will try to avoid changeovers in airports filled with other people. That desire to travel direct means \"the business case is probably going to be stronger\" for what Qantas calls \"Project Sunrise\". It is likely to eventually involve direct flights \"from Sydney and Melbourne non-stop into Europe and non-stop to the east coast of the United States\", he said. Tests have already taken place but the launch has been delayed, and is now not expected until 2024. Tackling climate change Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. But Qantas claims to have the \"world's biggest airline carbon offset programme\". It is also investing $38.7m (£28m, A$50m) in a partnership with BP to develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. In addition, it said it was looking at technology such as more fuel-efficient planes as well as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. \"I think you have to do it,\" Mr Joyce said. Spending money to cut emissions, he says, shows \"it's not just a focus on the bottom line\". \"You have to actually do the right thing by the environment, do the right thing by society. Otherwise, you don't have a social licence to operate in the future.\" Selling wine and biscuits To keep the finances on course during the pandemic Qantas has raised $770,000 (£560,000, A$1m) by selling bar carts that in-flight drinks were served from on its now-retired Boeing 747s, as well as wine in plastic bottles and a stock of the quintessentially Australian chocolate biscuit, Timtams. Mr Joyce says: \"You just have to have that flexibility, that adaptability, to survive.\" \"It's the reason why Qantas survived for 100 years\" and is the oldest continuous operating airline in the world, he said. \"That's part of our DNA. That's why we're going to survive for at the least the next 100 years.\" You can watch Alan Joyce's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 2330 GMT, Sunday 0530GMT, 1630 GMT, Monday 0730 GMT, 1130 GMT and Tuesday at 1330 GMT.", "summary": "Le patron de la compagnie aérienne australienne Qantas a confié à la BBC que \"les gouvernements vont insister\" pour que les voyageurs internationaux soient vaccinés."}

The Polisario Front, which wants independence for Western Sahara, dismissed Morocco's move as a gimmick. Morocco recently rejoined the African Union, which it had left in 1984 after the body's recognition of Polisario as the territory's government. The decision to withdraw from the Guerguerat zone is said to have been taken in person by the Moroccan King Mohammed VI. The move came after the sovereign spoke on the phone with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who asked him to pull out his troops. \"The Kingdom of Morocco will proceed from today with a unilateral withdrawal from the (Guerguerat) zone,\" the Moroccan foreign ministry said in a statement. Polisario said the move would hardly make any difference. \"The Moroccan decision to withdraw its troops near Guerguerat by a few hundred metres is window dressing,\" it said in a statement. Western Sahara is a sparsely-populated area of mostly desert situated on the north-west coast of Africa. It was annexed by Morocco in 1975 - a move resisted by the Polisario Front. A 16-year insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence. But this has yet to take place and Morocco still controls two-thirds of the territory, while thousands of refugees live over the border in Algeria. Willing to compromise?: James Copnall, Africa Editor, BBC World Service Morocco's decision to withdraw its troops does not signify a major change in the kingdom's policy - it will still work towards ensuring international recognition of its claim over Western Sahara. The announcement does, however, indicate a willingness to work with the United Nations, and in particular the new Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres' predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, infuriated Rabat by describing Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara as an \"occupation\" - a remark he later apologised for. Morocco is rolling out a renewed campaign on Western Sahara - including joining the African Union, and King Mohammed VI making several trips to African countries. The military withdrawal is also presumably intended to signal a willingness to compromise. But the Polisario Front and its supporters will want to know whether that extends to giving the Sahrawi people the referendum on their future which has been delayed for so many years.", "summary": "Le Maroc annonce son retrait d'une zone tampon mise en place par l'ONU dans le territoire contesté du Sahara occidental."}

However, it will be as the titular Black Panther in the blockbuster 2018 film he will be best remembered. Boseman stars as the ruler of Wakanda, a fictional African nation with the most advanced technology on earth. As well as winning critical praise and taking more than $1.3 billion US dollars (£973m) at cinemas worldwide, the film was widely seen as a cultural milestone for having a largely black cast and a black director, Ryan Coogler. Boseman said last year that the film had changed what it means to be \"young, gifted and black\". Black Panther was the first superhero film to get a nomination for best picture at the Oscars. He also played the same role in other Marvel films Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. A sequel was in the works and due to come out in 2022, with Boseman set to return. The news of his death came as a shock to many as Boseman never discussed his diagnosis publicly. However, fans started raising concerns over his health this year due to noticeable weight loss.

Last year the number of babies born in Japan fell below 865,000 - a record low. The fast-greying nation has long been searching for ways to reverse one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Boosting the use of AI tech is one of its latest efforts. Next year the government plans to allocate local authorities 2bn yen ($19m, £14m) to boost the birth rate, reported AFP news agency. Many already offer human-run matchmaking services and some have introduced AI systems in the hope they will perform a more sophisticated analysis of the standardised forms where people submit their details. A few of the existing systems are limited to considering criteria such as income and age, only producing a result if there is an exact match. Local media say that the funding aims to allow authorities to harness more costly advanced systems that take into account factors like hobbies and values. \"We are especially planning to offer subsidies to local governments operating or starting up matchmaking projects that use AI,\" a cabinet official told AFP. \"We hope this support will help reverse the decline in the nation's birthrate.\" Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Policymakers are racing to ensure the country's contracting workforce can meet the expanding costs of welfare. Sachiko Horiguchi, a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist at Japan's Temple University, thinks there are better ways for the government to bump up the birth rate than subsidising AI matchmaking - such as helping young people earning low wages. She pointed to a recent report which suggests a link between lower income levels and the loss of interest in romantic relationships among young Japanese adults. \"If they're not interested in dating, the matchmaking would likely be ineffective,\" Dr Horiguchi told the BBC. \"If we are to rely on technologies, affordable AI robots taking over household or childcare tasks may be more effective.\" Analysts have long pointed towards the lack of support for working mothers in Japan, where there are strong expectations women will do all the housework and raise children alongside doing their jobs.

Google denies Timnit Gebru's account of events that led to her leaving the company. She says she was fired for sending an internal email accusing Google of \"silencing marginalised voices\". She sent the email after a research paper she had co-authored was rejected. The fallout has caused many within the scientific community to question the ethics of conducting research with big technology companies. And on Monday, members of Dr Gebru's own team at Google published a second open letter challenging the company's account. 'Selective publication' \"I stand with Dr Timnit Gebru,\" said Tabitha Goldstaub, who chairs the UK government's AI council. \"She's brave, brilliant and we've all benefited from her work. \"This is another example of why independent, publicly funded research into AI is so important.\" University College London honorary associate professor Julien Cornebise said \"selective publication\" had occurred historically with the tobacco industry and cancer, as well as energy industries and climate change. \"AI researchers need to realise where they write their research is important because they might not have control over how it is used and published,\" he said. But for many experts conducting advanced research into AI and machine learning, partnering with technology companies such as Facebook and Google was the only option because of their resources and capabilities. \"It's a monopoly of research in this field,\" Prof Cornebise added. Ethical systems Signed by staff at Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix as well as several scientists from London-based AI company DeepMind - owned by Google parent company Alphabet - the open letter urges Google to explain why the paper was rejected. \"If we can't talk freely about the ethical challenges posed by AI systems, we will never build ethical systems,\" DeepMind research scientist Iason Gabriel tweeted. Dr Gebru is well known for her work on racial bias in technology and has criticised systems that fail to recognise black faces. On Twitter, users have expressed their solidarity through the hashtag #BelieveBlackWomen. 'Nothing unusual' \"She has been a huge advocate for black people in AI,\" Donia Scott, a fellow at the Association for Computational Linguistics, said. \"The fact even such a high-profile black woman has been treated like this is telling. \"There is nothing unusual about this for black women.\" AI researchers had always looked to Google \"as a force for good\", she added, but this would now change. 'Highly regarded' Warwick Business School associate professor of entrepreneurship and innovation Dr Noni Symeonidou,: \"If these allegations are true, Google's reaction will only prevent researchers to want to join in the future. \"And it will harm Google's ability to recruit talent and drive innovation.\" University College London postdoctoral researcher Julie Lee said she would be shocked if \"someone of Dr Gebru's renown and respect\" had been be fired \"in what seems like such a dispassionate manner... in a year that prompted many companies to release diversity statements supporting the hiring and retention of diverse candidates, particularly black women like Dr Gebru\". Lancaster University professor emerita Lucy Suchman said: \"It's remarkable that Google would feel sufficiently threatened by a research publication that they would engage in this act of censorship. \"One can only conclude that Google does not have the capacity within its research organisation to accommodate a black feminist scientist like Timnit Gebru, however highly regarded and widely respected she is.\" 'Too late' Dr Jeff Dean, lead of Google's AI division, said there had been \"a lot of speculation and misunderstanding\". Dr Gebru's paper had been submitted a day before its deadline, he said, too late for Google's review process, and he claimed it had ignored relevant research. \"Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who [we] had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback,\" Dr Dean said. \"Timnit wrote that if we didn't meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. \"We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.\" However, members of Dr Gebru's team have challenged this account. They said that \"just under half of all paper submitted to Google's approval process were submitted \"with a day or less notice\". And they added that the paper in question had already been circulated for internal and external feedback from 28 people, which they said was an \"unusually high number\", before its submission. One of the paper's co-authors has also taken issue with Dr Dean's suggestion that there were \"important gaps\" in its content that had prevented Google wanting to be affiliated with it. \"Our paper, written in a collaboration among seven scholars with diverse areas of expertise, is deeply rooted in several different research traditions,\" Prof Emily Bender from the University of Washington told the BBC. \"We ended up with 128 papers cited, which is far beyond what's typical for a conference paper. \"Nonetheless, as is always the case in research, there is surely more we could have cited.

But it won't happen without careful advance planning. And the time for that is now,\" said IATA's chief executive Alexandre de Juniac. While airlines have been shifting their focus onto delivering cargo during the severe downturn in passenger flights, shipping vaccines is far more complex. Not all planes are suitable for delivering vaccines as they need a typical temperature range of between 2 and 8C for transporting drugs. Some vaccines may require freezing temperatures which would exclude more aircraft. \"We know the procedures well. What we need to do is scale them up to the magnitude that will be required,\" added Glyn Hughes, the industry body's head of cargo. Flights to certain parts of the world, including some areas of South East Asia, will be critical as they lack vaccine-production capabilities, he added. Military precision Distributing a vaccine across Africa would be \"impossible\" right now IATA says given the lack of cargo capacity, size of the region and the complexities of border crossings. Transportation will need \"almost military precision\" and will require cool facilities across a network of locations where the vaccine will be stored. About 140 vaccines are in early development, and around two dozen are now being tested on people in clinical trials. One is being developed by the University of Oxford that is already in an advanced stage of testing. IATA has urged governments to begin careful planning now to ensure they are fully prepared once vaccines are approved and available for distribution.

Salah, 25, has scored a 31 Premier League goals this season this season (equalling the 38-game-season record held by Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer) with three league games still remaining. In Egypt, his triumph was front page news and the hashtag \"the legend Mohamed Salah\" has been shared more than 25,000 times since the announcement as compatriots paid tribute to the player Liverpool fans christened the 'Egyptian king'. Egyptian actress Rasha Mahdi was among many to tweet an image of Salah as a pharaoh. Salah is a national icon in Egypt. Last year, the footballer's 95th-minute penalty against Congo secured a 2-1 victory which saw the Egyptian national team qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Streets have been named in his honour, as well as a school in the city of Basyoun, while in January the footballer was received by Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. President al-Sisi was first elected president in May 2014, close to a year after he removed his elected predecessor, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, in a coup. The Muslim Brotherhood is now banned in Egypt. But political groups on both sides were among those to offer their congratulations. Pro-state figures and Muslim Brotherhood supporters alike were quick to signal their support. Haytham Abokhalil, a pro-Muslim Brotherhood human rights activist, said Salah's award \"gives confidence to our youth that it can be the best if it has the appropriate possibilities and opportunities\". To those sharing images of Salah's meeting with the Egyptian president, he said: \"whoever publishes photos of Sisi with captain Salah are a minority who wish to remain in the sick ward\". Several official state bodies have issued statements congratulating Salah.

Read on to find out why. 1. When did it all start? International Women's Day grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event. The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to then make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed unanimously. It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 107th International Women's Day. Things were made official in 1975 when the United Nations (UN) started celebrating the day and later set an annual theme. The first one (in 1996) was \"Celebrating the past, Planning for the Future\". International Women's Day has become a date to celebrate how far women have come in society, in politics and in economics, while the political roots of the day mean strikes and protests are often organised to raise awareness of continued inequality. 2. When is it? 8 March. Clara Zetkin's initial idea for an International Women's Day had no fixed date and it wasn't formalised until a war-time strike in 1917 when Russian women demanded \"bread and peace\". Four days into the women's strike the Tsar was forced to abdicate and the provisional government granted women the right to vote. The date when the women's strike commenced on the Julian calendar, which was then in use in Russia, was Sunday 23 February. This day in the Gregorian calendar was 8 March - and that's when it's celebrated today. 3. Is there an International Men's Day? There is indeed, on 19 November. But it has only been marked since the 1990s and isn't recognised by the UN. People celebrate it in more than 60 countries, including the UK. The objectives of the day are \"to focus attention on men's and boys' health, improve gender relations, promote gender equality, and highlight positive male role models\". The theme for 2017 was 'Celebrate Men and Boys.' 4. How is Women's Day celebrated around the world? International Women's Day is a national holiday in many countries including Russia, where the sales of flowers doubles during the three or four days around 8 March as men and women give flowers to their female loved ones and co-workers. In China, many women are given a half-day off work on 8 March, as advised by the State Council, although employers don't always observe the tradition. In Italy, International Women's Day or la Festa della Donna is celebrated by the giving of mimosa blossom. The origin of this tradition is unclear but it is believed to have started in Rome after World War Two. In the US, the month of March is Women's History Month. A presidential proclamation issued every year honours the achievements of American women. 5. What is happening this year? An International Women's Day campaign has taken on the theme #PressForProgress. Last year, millions of protesters in the US and around the world took to the streets in favour of women's rights after the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency. In 2018 tens of thousands of people took to the streets again in cities across America, to demonstrate against the president, as well as encourage more women to sign up to vote. What is 100 Women? BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. On 8 March, BBC 100 Women will be showcasing inspirational stories from women in the UK and across the world.

The restriction was also seen as violating Tunisia's constitution which was adopted in 2014 in the wake of the Arab Spring revolution. Human rights groups in Tunisia had also campaigned for the law's abolition. The order comes into force immediately and couples are free to register their marriages at government offices. An important milestone Rana Jawad, BBC News, Tunis Many Tunisians see the removal of the marriage restriction as another landmark in guaranteeing women's freedom in the country. It sets apart Tunisia as the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to remove the legal hurdles to marrying outside the official state religion. It is an important milestone in a region where religion in marital ties can be at the heart of many a family feud, and long struggles against state laws. Unlike Muslim women, men can marry non-Muslim women without providing any religious documents. Tunisia is also home to a Jewish, as well as a small Christian, minority and it is not entirely clear how the marriage restriction applied to them. Scrapping the decree may not do away with the cultural and traditional obstacles women face with their families in cases of inter-faith marriage, but it now offers Tunisian women greater freedom of choice from a legal perspective. In July, the Tunisian parliament also introduced a new law that abolished a clause that allowed rapists to escape any punishment if they married their victims. The country banned polygamy as far back as 1956, setting it apart from other Muslim-majority nations. However, women in Tunisia still face discrimination, particularly in matters of inheritance which still prioritises sons over daughters. The Tunisian Association of Democratic Women estimates that nearly 70% of Tunisian women are victims of abuse. Amnesty International reported last year that there were few signs to show that things had improved for women since the Arab Spring revolution in 2010.", "summary": "La Tunisie abolit l'interdiction du mariage des femmes avec des non-musulmans."}

At the event, the rapper seemed to make policy decisions off-the-cuff and made several rants, including on abortion and on abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Fans have questioned whether his last-minute bid for the White House is actually a promotional stunt. The Charleston rally did little to clarify whether his run is genuine. But a now-deleted tweet sent from West's account on Saturday, appearing to show the song list for a new album, added to the speculation. The event, held at a wedding and conference hall in the city, was said to be open to registered guests only - but West's campaign website had no function for people to register or RSVP. What did Kanye West say at the rally? West appeared with \"2020\" shaved into the back of his head and wearing a protective security vest, and addressed the gathered crowd without a microphone. There were no audience microphones either, leading West to repeatedly tell the crowd to be silent so he could hear the questions being asked. At one point he began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him: \"There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy.\" He added: \"I almost killed my daughter... even if my wife [Kim Kardashian West] were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to.\" However he then added that he believes abortion should remain legal, but there should be financial support for struggling new mothers - suggesting that \"everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars\". \"The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,\" he said. \"Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?\" At another moment, he gave an impromptu monologue about 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman. \"Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,\" he said. Tubman was born into slavery, but managed to escape a Maryland plantation in 1849, aged 27. She then returned to the South to rescue other slaves on the network of routes and safe houses known as \"underground railroad\", risking her own life to lead people to freedom. West also became tearful when talking about his late mother, who died in 2007 from complications during cosmetic surgery. What has the reaction been? The speech has been met with anger by some - mostly sparked by his comments about Tubman - but also with concern over West's welfare. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he feared West's rambling appearance pointed towards a \"manic episode\" - although he acknowledged he was not a psychologist. \"He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication. \"He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things.\" Professor Nichols added that he was disappointed, as he had hoped West would be able \"to push the other candidates\", had he had the right advice and support. \"I was actually interested to see what would happen, but after the event today, all that interest has just turned to worry.\" Will Kanye West actually be on state ballots? West, who announced his candidacy on 4 July, has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states. He needs to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in a number of others. Last week he qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the deadline. In order to appear on South Carolina's ballot he needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon local time (18:00 BST) on Monday.", "summary": "Kanye West a officiellement lancé sa campagne pour l'élection présidentielle américaine de 2020 lors d'un rassemblement à Charleston, en Caroline du Sud."}

When I heard him say these words I felt sick to my stomach. I had already witnessed what he described - young Nigerians hooked on cough syrup made with codeine, an opioid which can be addictive. A 14-year-old girl from my home city of Lagos, her parents distressed and unsure how to help her. A young man in Kano, chained to the floor of a rehab centre, swarming with flies, driven mad by months of drinking syrup with his friends. My own brother has suffered from codeine cough syrup addiction. The strawberry tasting opioid hooked him after our father was killed. Grief, depression, a desire to be cool are just some of the reasons Nigerians are falling for this drug. Musicians sing about the high it gives you. Dealers peddle it in nightclubs and on the streets. Teenagers mix it with soft drinks, or swig it straight from the bottle at \"syrup parties\". Mr Hussan, aka Baba Ibeji, works at Bioraj Pharmaceuticals, a licensed medical producer which manufactures a codeine cough syrup called Biolin. The company is a major supplier to northern Nigeria. He is one of a number of pharmaceutical company employees who the BBC have secretly filmed doing illegal cough syrup deals over the past few months. It is not illegal to drink or manufacture the medicine - but it is against the law to sell it to people without a doctor's prescription or those who don't have a pharmaceutical licence. \"Even if someone wants to buy 1,000 cartons, we won't give them a receipt,\" Mr Hassan told us, explaining how he avoids detection from authorities. Corruption like this is against Bioraj company policy, but is helping to fuel the industrial quantities of syrup leaking on to the black market. When we informed Bioraj that we had evidence Mr Hassan was engaging in this illicit activity, it responded with a statement saying the company only sells codeine cough syrup legitimately, that Mr Hassan denies wrongdoing, and that company chairman Bioku Rahamon personally guards Biolin sales. Like all opioids, codeine is in the same chemical family as heroin. It's an effective painkiller, but is also capable of giving you a euphoric high if consumed in large quantities. It is highly addictive and, taken in excess, can have a devastating impact on the mind and body. In the Dorayi Rehabilitation Centre in Kano, I met a man said by staff to have been driven insane by the drug. He was shackled at the ankles and chained to the roots of a tree, screaming and thrashing his arms. Seventy-two hours earlier he had been out on the streets, breaking car windows in traffic. \"He's still going through his withdrawal issues now,\" said Sani Usaini, the officer in charge of the rehab centre. Codeine cough syrup - the scale of the problem In addition to kidney damage and seizures, serious abuse of codeine cough syrup can trigger mental psychosis - delusions, hallucinations, and even schizophrenia. Many of the syrup addicts in the rehab centre can become so violent that staff chain them to the floor. \"He can't be in a bed because he has broken the bed, he has broken the windows and hurt himself,\" Mr Usaini told me, as I stood in front of another shackled young man. The air hung with a faint smell of faeces and the hum of flies. \"Plenty of parents come here to cry.\" Pharmaceutical company employees who illegally sell syrup on to the black market know just how addictive codeine can be. Among them is Chukwunonye Madubuike, a business development executive with Emzor pharmaceuticals, which illegally sold us 60 bottles of codeine syrup in a hotel room deal in Lagos. \"When somebody is addicted to something - you get me? - and he needs it, the price I don't think is an issue on this,\" he told us. \"This is a product that I know that if I have one million cartons, I can sell it in a week.\" Emzor Pharmaceuticals told us that it is now investigating Mr Madubuike, adding he has access to a very limited amount of Emzolyn with codeine and could not sell large quantities illegally. The company says it is a responsible and compliant business, is reviewing its distribution policies, and treating our findings with the utmost seriousness. 'It crosses all class' In Kano, northern Nigeria, the drug enforcement agency (NDLEA) regularly leads raids to seize and destroy codeine syrup destined for street sale. Officers showed us over two tonnes of syrup - Bioraj's Biolin with codeine - that had been seized by Swat teams. They also showed us weapons criminal drug gangs use to protect their business, including knives, swords, and even a chainsaw that had been used to attack an NDLEA officer. But the NDLEA in Kano, by its own admission, is struggling to cope with the sheer scale of the syrup epidemic. The Nigerian Senate estimates that as many as three million bottles of codeine syrup are drunk every single day in just two states, Kano and Jigawa. \"We may not even arrest 10% [of cough syrup on the market],\" said Commander Hamza Umar of the NDLEA in Kano. \"It crosses all class, no matter the level - rich and poor, educated and illiterate, a beggar and a toddler.\" Back in the rehab centre, Mr Usaini measures the scale of the epidemic by the number of young syrup addicts who are brought into his care. He used to see perhaps two or three cases each week, but \"now we see seven, eight, sometimes even 10 within a week… Any child that you see they're bringing here as a drug addict? It's codeine.\" In a windowless room, still shaking after two months of withdrawal, we found one of those children - a 16-year-old girl in a pink hijab who told us that she used to get syrup from her boyfriend and drink it after school. She had a simple message for other young Nigerians tempted by the syrup craze: \"I would advise them not to go into it if they haven't already. If they do, it will ruin their lives.\" This is the first report from BBC Africa's new investigations unit, Africa Eye.", "summary": "Lorsque le frère cadet de Ruona Meyer, journaliste BBC, est devenu accro au sirop contre la toux, elle a commencé à enquêter sur les personnes qui fabriquent et vendent des médicaments à base de codéine dans les rues de Lagos, au Nigéria.

In a post on the dark web, the gang posted receipts for $10,000 in Bitcoin donations to two charities. One of them, Children International, says it will not be keeping the money. The move is being seen as a strange and troubling development, both morally and legally. In the blog post on 13 October, the hackers claim they only target large profitable companies with their ransomware attacks. The attacks hold organisations' IT systems hostage until a ransom is paid. They wrote: \"We think that it's fair that some of the money the companies have paid will go to charity. \"No matter how bad you think our work is, we are pleased to know that we helped changed someone's life. Today we sended (sic) the first donations.\" The cyber-criminals posted the donation along with tax receipts they received in exchange for the 0.88 Bitcoin they had sent to two charities, The Water Project and Children International. Children International supports children, families and communities in India, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Zambia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States. A Children International spokesperson told the BBC: \"If the donation is linked to a hacker, we have no intention of keeping it\". The Water Project, which works to improve access to clean water in sub-Saharan Africa, has not responded to requests for comment. Brett Callow, Threat Analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, said: \"What the criminals hope to achieve by making these donations is not at all clear. Perhaps it helps assuage their guilt? Or perhaps for egotistical reasons they want to be perceived as Robin Hood-like characters rather than conscienceless extortionists. \"Whatever their motivations, it's certainly a very unusual step and is, as far as I know, the first time a ransomware group has donated a portion of their profits to charity.\" The Darkside hacker group is relatively new on the scene, but analysis of the crypto-currency market confirms they are actively extorting funds from victims. There is also evidence they may have links to other cyber-criminal groups responsible for high-profile attacks on companies including Travelex, which was crippled by ransomware in January. The way the hackers paid the charities is also a possible cause for concern for law enforcement. The cyber-criminals used a US-based service called The Giving Block, which is used by 67 different non-profits from around the world including Save The Children, Rainforest Foundation and She's The First. The Giving Block describes itself online as \"the only non-profit specific solution for accepting crypto-currency donations\". The company was set up in 2018 to offer cryptocurrency 'millionaires' the ability to take advantage of the \"huge tax incentive to donate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly to non-profits\". The Giving Block told the BBC it was not aware these donations were made by cyber-criminals. It said: \"We are still working to determine if these funds were actually stolen. \"If it turns out these donations were made using stolen funds, we will of course begin the work of returning them to the rightful owner.\" The company did not clarify if this means returning the stolen money to the criminals, or attempting to work out which of the criminal victims it intended to reimburse and how. The Giving Block, which is also an advocate for crypto-currencies, added: \"The fact they used crypto will make it easier, not harder, to catch them.\" However, The Giving Block has not given details on what information they collect on their donors. Most services that buy and sell digital coins like Bitcoin require users to verify their identity, but it's not clear whether this has been done here. As an experiment, the BBC attempted to donate anonymously through The Giving Block's online system, and was not asked any identity verification questions. Experts say the case highlights the complexity and dangers of anonymous donations. Crypto-currency investigator Philip Gradwell from Chainalysis said: \"If you walked into a charity shop with an anonymous mask on and donated £10,000 in cash, then asked for a taxable receipt, questions should probably be asked - and it's no different. \"It's right to say that researchers and law enforcement have become adept at tracing crypto-currency funds as they are moved around from wallet to wallet. But finding who actually owns each wallet is far more complicated. \"By allowing anonymous donations from potentially illicit sources, it opens up the danger of money laundering. \"All crypto-currency businesses need a full range of Anti-Money Laundering measures including a Know Your Customer (KYC) program of basic background checks, so that they can understand who is behind the transactions their business facilitates.\" The BBC has spoken with other charities which accept donations via The Giving Project. Save the Children told the BBC it would \"never knowingly take money obtained through crime\". She's the First, a charity for girls' education around the world, said it would not be comfortable accepting money from anonymous, possibly criminal, sources and said: \"It's a shame that bad actors would exploit the opportunity to donate crypto-currency for personal gain, and we hope that even anonymous donors share our community's values.\"", "summary": "Un groupe de pirates informatiques fait des dons d'argent volé à des œuvres de charité : une première qui laisse perplexes les experts de la cyber-criminalité."}

Of the women who had experienced any of these acts, wanted or otherwise, 20% said they had been left upset or frightened. Anna, 23, says she has experienced unwanted acts of violence during consensual sex on three separate occasions, with different men. For her, it started with hair pulling and slapping. Then the man tried to put his hands around her neck. \"I was shocked,\" she said, \"I felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated. If someone slapped or choked you on the street, it would be assault\". It wasn't until Anna spoke to her friends about it that she realised how common it was. \"From then on, pretty much all the guys would try at least one, if not multiple combinations, of these acts.\" On another occasion, she says she was choked by a man during sex - without consent or warning. Anna, who graduated from university this year, also says she had a partner who handled her so forcefully, that she was left bruised and in pain for days. \"I know some women will say they like this. What is problematic is when men assume that every woman wants this.\" Research company Savanta ComRes asked 2,002 UK women aged between 18 and 39 if they had experienced slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex, and if it was ever unwanted. The sample was weighted to be representative of all UK women by age and region. More than a third (38%) had experienced these acts and said they were unwanted at least some of the time, while just under two-thirds of women had either experienced it and said it was never unwanted (31%), or they had no experience, didn't know or preferred not to say (31%). The Centre for Women's Justice told the BBC the figures showed the \"growing pressure on young women to consent to violent, dangerous and demeaning acts\". It said: \"This is likely to be due to the widespread availability, normalisation and use of extreme pornography.\" Adina Claire, Acting Co-Chief Executive of Women's Aid, said it indicated \"how frequently sexual violence is being experienced by women under 40, with partners they consent to have sex with going on to humiliate or frighten them. \"Consenting to have sex with someone does not lessen the seriousness of slapping or choking someone.\" 'I felt terrified' 'Emma' is in her thirties and had just come out of a long-term relationship when she had a one-night stand. \"We ended up in bed and during sex - without warning - he started choking me. I was really shocked and felt terrified. I didn't say anything at the time because at the back of my head, I felt vulnerable, like this man could overpower me.\" She also puts this down to the influence of pornography. \"It felt like this was stuff he had seen online and wanted to play out in real life.\" The research also suggested that of those who had experienced slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex, 42% felt pressured, coerced or forced into it. Violence becoming 'normalised' Steven Pope is a psychotherapist specialising in sex and relationships. He told 5 Live that he deals with the negative impact of the rise of acts of these kinds \"day in, day out\". \"It's a silent epidemic. People do it because they think it's the norm but it can be very harmful. What we see is that for many, it devalues the relationship but - at its worst - violence becomes acceptable.\" He is concerned that those who engage in these acts are not aware of the risks. \"People come to me when they've had 'near misses'; when strangulation or 'choking out' has overstepped the mark, and they were unconscious for a long time. \"The thing with strangulation is that it's always high-risk, but that's literally the last thing people are thinking about.\" Campaigner Fiona McKenzie described the survey findings as \"especially frightening\". \"I regularly hear from women who had been choked, slapped, spat on, verbally abused and punched by men they were having otherwise consensual sex with. In many cases women weren't initially able to recognise this as the traumatic assault it is.\" She set up a campaign group, We Can't Consent to This, after she noticed a rise in the number of cases where women had been killed during a so-called 'sex game gone wrong' - and where consent was used as a defence or mitigation. Anna said sex has become \"very male-centric... It has become so 'pornified', there isn't much in it for women.\" And she said violence during sex has become normalised: \"They were just ordinary guys. There was nothing unifying about them, although I assume they are fairly frequent consumers of porn. They watch that and assume that's what women want, but they don't ask.\" The research comes in the wake of recent cases that have heard defences of 'rough sex' - such as that of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane.

The Nobel Prize committee said their discoveries ultimately \"saved millions of lives\". The virus is a common cause of liver cancer and a major reason why people need a liver transplant. In the 1960s, there was huge concern that people receiving donated blood were getting chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation) from an unknown, mysterious disease. The Nobel Prize committee said a blood transfusion at the time was like \"Russian roulette\". Highly sensitive blood tests mean such cases have now been eliminated in many parts of the world, and effective anti-viral drugs have also been developed. \"For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating Hepatitis C virus from the world,\" the prize committee said. However, there are 70 million people currently living with the virus, which still kills around 400,000 a year. The mystery killer The viruses Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B had been discovered by the mid-1960s. But Prof Harvey Alter, while studying transfusion patients at the US National Institutes of Health in 1972, showed there was another, mystery, infection at work. Patients were still getting sick after receiving donated blood. He showed that giving blood from infected patients to chimpanzees led to them developing the disease. The mysterious illness became known as \"non-A, non-B\" hepatitis and the hunt was now on. Prof Michael Houghton, while at the pharmaceutical firm Chiron, managed to isolated the genetic sequence of the virus in 1989. This showed it was a type of flavivirus and it was named Hepatitis C. And Prof Charles Rice, while at Washington University in St. Louis, applied the finishing touches in 1997. He injected a genetically engineered Hepatitis C virus into the liver of chimpanzees and showed this could lead to hepatitis. Prof Houghton, now at the University of Alberta in Canada, told the BBC: \"We had limited tools available to us then, so it was rather like searching for a needle in a haystack. \"The amount of virus present in the liver and the blood was very low, and the sensitivity of our techniques was not high enough, so we were sailing very close to the wind all the time. \"We tried a lot of methods, probably 30 or 40 different methodological approaches over seven years, and eventually one worked.\" Commenting on the announcement, Dr Claire Bayntun, a clinical consultant in global public health and vice-president of Royal Society of Medicine, said the discovery was an \"extraordinary achievement\".

He said that Cuba's foreign policy would remain \"unaltered\" and that any \"necessary changes\" would be decided by the Cuban people. A large part of his speech was dedicated to praising his predecessor in office, to whom he said: \"Cuba needs you.\" This prompted the more than 600 National Assembly members to rise to their feet and give the 86-year-old former leader a standing ovation. Any changes Mr Díaz-Canel will bring in are likely to be gradual, slow-paced and in keeping with the reforms Raúl Castro introduced since he first took over power from his brother, Fidel. Key reforms under Raúl Castro: 2008: New agricultural strategy is launched, promising to grant a million hectares of land to private farmers 2010: Loosening of rules governing business activities, allowing Cubans to set up their own small private businesses 2011: Opening up of the housing market, allowing Cubans to buy and sell their homes 2013: First wi-fi zones created as part of a push to make the internet more accessible for Cubans 2014: US-Cuban thaw announced leading to the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the former foes Source: BBC Monitoring The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Donald Trump.

The green-lighting of a pilot project after years of debate drew a swift outcry from environmental groups, who warned of unintended consequences. One group condemned the plan as a public \"Jurassic Park experiment\". Activists warn of possible damage to ecosystems, and the potential creation of hybrid, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. But the company involved says there will be no adverse risk to humans or the environment, and points to a slate of government-backed studies. The plan to release the mosquitoes in 2021 in the Florida Keys, a string of islands, comes months after the modified mosquitoes were approved by federal regulators. In May, the US Environmental Agency granted permission to the British-based, US-operated company Oxitec to produce the genetically engineered, male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are known as OX5034. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to spread deadly diseases to humans such dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. Only female mosquitoes bite humans because they need blood to produce eggs. So the plan is to release the male, modified mosquitoes who will then hopefully breed with wild female mosquitoes. However the males carry a protein that will kill off any female offspring before they reach mature biting age. Males, which only feed on nectar, will survive and pass on the genes. Over time, the aim is to reduce the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the area and thereby reduce the spread of disease to humans. On Tuesday, officials in the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) gave final approval to release 750 million of the modified mosquitoes over a two-year period. The plan has many critics, including nearly 240,000 people who signed a petition on Change.org slamming Oxitec's plan to use US states \"as a testing ground for these mutant bugs\". According to Oxitec's website, the company has found positive results conducting field trials in Brazil. It also plans to deploy them in Texas beginning in 2021 and has gained federal approval, but not state or local approval, according to reports. In a statement denouncing the project, environmental group Friends of the Earth said: \"The release of genetically engineered mosquitoes will needlessly put Floridians, the environment and endangered species at risk in the midst of a pandemic.\" But an Oxitec scientist told AP news agency: \"We have released over a billion of our mosquitoes over the years. There is no potential for risk to the environment or humans\". The Aedes aegypti is invasive to southern Florida, and are commonly found in urban areas where they live in standing pools of water. In many areas, including the Florida Keys, they have developed a resistance to pesticides.

One simple question arises above all else in the case of Högel and others like him: Why did they kill? Offenders rarely talk, and even when they do, \"we should be cautious about believing them,\" said Elizabeth Yardley, Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University. An offender may claim to have taken a patient's life to end their suffering. This is how American nurse Charles Cullen, who admitted killing at least 29 patients, explained his behaviour, although this was discredited as some of his victims were in recovery. \"Their words are not truths but performances,\" Prof Yardley said. Others may kill in order to get rid of what they see as difficult patients. In a confession, Canadian killer nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer described feeling deep anger at her eight victims, whom she injected with fatal doses of insulin. Her first victim was James Silcox, an 84-year-old patient who struggled with dementia. He was killed in September 2007. \"That evening I got the urge to overdose James,\" Wettlaufer wrote. \"At approximately 7:30 pm I decided to overdose him with insulin, hoping he would die.\" 'Hero syndrome' Criminologist David Wilson said Högel showed signs of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This refers to a form of child abuse where carers deliberately induce or fabricate illnesses in children to seek personal attention. Prosecutors said Högel attacked patients in order to impress colleagues by subsequently trying to revive them. He even earned the nickname \"Resuscitation Rambo.\" Katherine Ramsland, a professor of forensic psychology, said there are differences in why a doctor might kill, in comparison to a nurse. Doctors often kill \"from the desire to feel a godlike sense of power over patients or from experimental curiosity,\" Prof Ramsland said. \"Nurses, on the other hand, often feel put upon and undervalued,\" she added. \"Their killing sprees appear to have other motives, such as gaining attention, finding a small realm of power in an otherwise powerless world, assuaging depression, paying back an unfair system, and acting out to relieve frustration or workload.\" Kenneth V. Iserson, author of Demon Doctors: Physicians As Serial Killers, said the doctors he studied \"all seemed to feel that everyone in the world existed only for their own benefit.\" What are the red flags? Prof Ramsland outlined a 22-point checklist of 'red flags' that have been associated with healthcare serial killers. These include predicting when a patient will die, moving from one hospital to another, preferring nightshifts, trying to prevent others from checking their patients, and being associated with incidents at other hospitals. Although a few of these would not be alarming in isolation, Prof Wilson said a \"cluster\" of five or more would be a cause for concern. Cullen displayed half of the 22 traits, according to a report by Prof Wilson and Prof Yardley. When serial killing medical professionals are finally unmasked, it becomes clear that many people recognised red flags along the way, Prof Iserson said. But he adds: \"Some of the perpetrators got away with multiple murders simply because authorities in various jurisdictions did not communicate with each other.\" Nurse shortages in the UK and the US have also been cited as a reason for proper checks being overlooked. 'Entitled to kill' Whether healthcare serial killers enter the field in order to kill - or fall into it - is difficult to say. A \"rare few\" enter the profession to become \"angels of death,\" while many transform into killers on the job, Prof Ramsland said. Prof Yardley said it was often a combination of the two. \"These are individuals who will have obtained a sense of power and enjoyment from harming people in the past and see opportunities to escalate this behaviour in a hospital when they become aware of the access and opportunities that this setting affords,\" she said. An example of this would be Beverley Allitt, who killed, attempted to kill, or seriously harm 13 children in her care within an 8-week period in Lincolnshire in 1991, Prof Yardley said. Allitt had demonstrated particularly controlling and coercive behaviour towards an ex-partner before killing children. Most importantly, Prof Yardley said medical serial killers choose to kill because of the feelings of power and control that it gives them. \"These people have control over life and death. They feel a sense of ownership, possession and control over their patients,\" she said. \"They feel entitled to harm and kill them.\"", "summary": "Niels Högel, est désormais soupçonné d'être à l'origine de la mort de 106 patients, alors qu'il était infirmier dans le nord de l'Allemagne."}

Announcing the normalisation, Mr Trump said \"at least five more\" Arab states wanted a peace deal with Israel. The Sudan deal comes weeks after similar moves by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. The two Gulf states became the first in the Middle East to recognise Israel in 26 years. The UAE's foreign ministry said it welcomed Sudan's decision, calling it \"an important step to boost security and prosperity in the region.\" Sudan and Israel said in a three-way statement with the US that delegations would meet \"in the coming weeks\". \"The leaders agreed to the normalisation of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,\" it said. Until last month only two Arab nations - Egypt and Jordan - had officially recognised Israel. The two countries, which border Israel, signed peace agreements in 1979 and 1994 respectively, following US mediation. Mauritania, an African Arab League member, recognised Israel in 1999 but severed ties 10 years later. The growing number of Arab countries formalising relations with Israel has been condemned by the Palestinians, who see it as a betrayal of their cause. Historically, Arab countries conditioned peace talks with Israel on its withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war and the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that he rejected the new agreement, saying no-one had the right to speak on behalf of Palestinians. Hamas, which controls Gaza, said it was a \"political sin\". How was the move announced? Shortly after Mr Trump formally moved to remove Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, reporters in Washington were taken to the Oval Office where the president was on the phone to the Sudanese and Israeli leaders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the agreement was a \"dramatic breakthrough for peace\" and the start of a \"new era\". Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok thanked Mr Trump for removing his country from the US terrorism list and said the Sudanese government was working \"towards international relations that best serve our people\". Sudanese state TV said the \"state of aggression\" would end. While on the phone to the two world leaders, Mr Trump said: \"Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal? Somehow I don't think so.\" \"Sleepy Joe\" is his pejorative nickname for his opponent in the upcoming US presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. In response, Mr Netanyahu said: \"Well, Mr President, one thing I can tell you is, um, uh, we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.\" The move is seen as a foreign policy victory for Mr Trump ahead of the 3 November eletion. BBC correspondents say the timing of the announcement is no coincidence. Mr Trump's pro-Israel policies are seen by his advisers as appealing to Christian evangelical voters, a key part of his voter base. The US president also said \"at least five more\" Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, are considering normalising relations with Israel. His aide, Judd Deere, said the Sudan deal was \"another major step toward building peace in the Middle East with another nation joining the Abraham Accords\", the term used for the deals signed with the UAE and Bahrain. Meanwhile, Israel said it would not oppose US sales of high-grade military hardware to the UAE. The US had agreed to consider allowing the UAE to buy F-35 fighter jets after normalising ties with Israel. Israel had said it needed to maintain a military advantage over other states in the Middle East. However, earlier this week it said the US had agreed to upgrade Israeli military capabilities. How did we get here? Sudan had been a foe of Israel since the latter's founding in 1948. Famously, it was the site of a declaration against normalisation with Israel in 1967, when the Arab League, meeting in the capital, Khartoum, swore \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it\". It fought in wars against Israel in 1948 and 1967, provided a haven for Palestinian guerrilla groups and is suspected of sending Iranian arms to Palestinian militants in Gaza several years ago - prompting alleged Israeli air strikes against it. The political dynamics changed with the overthrow last year of Sudan's long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir and his replacement by a transitional civilian-military council. Sudan's generals, who wield the real power, have supported establishing relations with Israel as a way to help get US sanctions on Sudan lifted and open the door to badly needed economic aid. However, the reaction to the deal in Sudan has been mixed. Some feel Sudan's leaders gave in to Mr Trump's proposal under duress, and out of desperation to be removed from the US's State Sponsors of Terrorism list, BBC senior Africa correspondent Anne Soy reports. This week, Donald Trump said Sudan would be removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism once the US received $335m (£259m) in compensation for attacks on US embassies in Africa. The attacks in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 were carried out by al-Qaeda while its leader, Osama bin Laden, was living in Sudan. Sudan has since placed the money in a special escrow holding account for the victims of these attacks.", "summary": "Le Soudan doit normaliser ses relations avec Israël, le dernier d'une série de pays de la Ligue arabe à le faire."}

His current wife Maesaiah Thabane has already been charged with the murder. He would be the first African leader to be charged with a domestic murder while in office, in a case that has shocked the tiny mountain kingdom. Lipolelo, 58, was shot dead two days before Mr Thabane became prime minister in 2017. At the time, he described her killing as \"senseless\" but police now accuse him of being involved in her killing. \"The prime minister is going to be charged with the murder,\" Deputy Commissioner of Police Paseka Mokete was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. \"The police are preparing directives and he will probably be charged tomorrow [Friday],\" he added. What does the prime minister say? Mr Thabane said on state radio that he had served the nation \"diligently\" and he would retire at the end of July, Reuters reports. \"I've worked for a peaceful and stable Lesotho. Today... at my age, I have lost most of my energy,\" he was quoted as saying. The ruling All Basotho Convention had given him a deadline of Thursday to resign. Constitutional crisis looms Lesotho's prime minister is not going down without a fight - his party, the All Basotho Convention (ABC) and its leadership, were expecting him to accept an ultimatum to step down ahead of the opening of parliament on Friday but he has refused. But it now looks highly unlikely that he will be appearing at parliament on Friday as planned. It's a desperate time for Mr Thabane, who has lost favour with his allies in this coalition government. He is now seen as a sinking ship and they do not want to go down with him. The prime minister is running out of time and room to manoeuvre - the country's police want him charged and hauled before a court, all by the end of this week. His arrest will not only be a great humiliation to the prime minister but could also plunge the country in a constitutional crisis - it's not every day that a sitting leader is charged with a crime. How did the murder take place? Lipolelo was gunned down at close range on the side of a dirt road while returning to her home in a small village on the outskirts of the capital, Maseru. She was involved in bitter divorce proceedings with Mr Thabane when she was killed. At the time, the prime minister was living with Maesaiah, 42, as if she were his wife. But Lipolelo had already won a separate legal battle to be recognised as first lady, as opposed to Maesaiah. Maesaiah accompanied Mr Thabane to his inauguration, following his estranged wife's death. Two months later she and Mr Thabane got married in a Catholic ceremony held at a packed stadium in Maseru. Maesaiah was charged with her rival's murder on 5 February, and is out on bail of about $67 (£52). She has also been charged with the attempted murder of a family friend Thato Sibolla, who was with Lipolelo at the time of the shooting and is expected to be a key witness in the murder case.

Royal Mail would not comment on how many of its workers had been prosecuted for stealing mail since it was privatised in 2013. However, 1,759 Royal Mail workers were convicted of theft between 2007 and 2011. Figures from UK Finance show the problem does not seem to be getting any better with the number of cases, and the cost to card issuers, rising each year since 2014. In 2016, there were 11,377 cases of fraud where a card is stolen in transit, costing card issuers £12.5m. UK Finance said it works closely with Royal Mail to target these types of gangs. It has its own police unit with prosecution powers. \"We do have our own police unit and they target organised criminality,\" Katy Worobec, head of fraud detection at UK Finance said. \"They try and get the people who are actually organising the criminality behind the scene. \"Once you've taken that part of the gang out, the thing falls apart. \"We've got a very good relationship with Royal Mail to help target these types of gangs and we've seen some good successes in the past.\" Royal Mail said: \"We take all instances of fraud - alleged or actual - very seriously. \"Our security team is reviewing the programme's findings as a matter of urgency and will continue our close and ongoing cooperation with the relevant law enforcement agency. \"The overwhelming majority of postmen and women do all they can to protect the mail and deliver it safely. The safety and security of mail is of the utmost importance to Royal Mail. \"We deliver millions of items safely every day and the theft of mail is rare. The business operates a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty. We prosecute anyone we believe has committed a crime.\" 'I don't trust postmen' Darren Blythe, from Banbury, had his bank card intercepted by postal worker Damon Alvey in 2013. He sensed something was wrong when the new bank card he requested did not arrive within the estimated time. \"I was waiting and waiting and eventually I rang the bank and that's when they told me my bank account had been wiped out totally.\" Alvey, from Thame, was jailed for 10 months in 2014 for the fraud which saw about £3,000 taken from Mr Blythe's account. \"He left me with just over £2 in my account,\" Mr Blythe said. \"It made me really depressed. I was stuck indoors for days and days on end.\" Although his money was refunded by the bank within two weeks, Mr Blythe said he did not \"trust postmen any more really\". *Additional reporting by Riyah Collins You can see this story in full on BBC Inside Out West Midlands at 19:30 BST on BBC One on Monday 4 September, or via iPlayer for seven days afterwards.", "summary": "Les travailleurs des postes reçoivent 1 000 livres sterling par semaine pour voler des cartes bancaires, a révélé une enquête de la BBC."}

The typically Republican state flipped during the 2020 presidential election, helping hand President Joe Biden his White House win. Voters there also delivered victory to two Democratic Senate candidates in January, giving Democrats a slim majority in the upper chamber of Congress. Republicans remain in control of Georgia's state government, however, and have now approved bills that would cut voter access. Measures include limiting the use of drop boxes to return ballots, requiring photo identification for voting by mail and cutting back early voting on weekends. Conservatives argue the \"common-sense\" restrictions are necessary to keep the electoral process fair. Advocates say these measures would disproportionately affect black voters, who are a third of voters in the state, especially as many church voting drives happen on Sundays. Other states led by Republicans have put forth similar measures. James launched More Than A Vote following national protests over the death of George Floyd last year.

Black economic empowerment was introduced to address racial inequality in South Africa and takes the form of affirmative action, including preferential employment, skills training and selective procurement of government contracts. The opposition Democratic Alliance says the policy has been a failure which \"has only served to enrich a politically connected elite and to dampen economic growth.\" So, how unequal is the workplace in South Africa and are the numbers changing? A starting point in this highly contested debate is to look at who occupies management positions, using racial categories adopted by the South African government. Companies are required to report this information to an employment equity commission. First let's look at the most senior level - the top managers. Although black South Africans make up nearly 80% of the economically active population, they hold just 14% of top management jobs. In comparison, 67% of these top positions are held by white employees - a figure which has declined slightly in the last three years. White people make up 9% of the economically active population, according to the equity commission. Indian-South Africans are 2.8% of the economically active population, and hold 9% of the top management jobs. In the private sector, around 70% of top managers are white, while more than 70% of top managers in government jobs are black. The equality commission has also found that 77% of top management posts are occupied by men. \"A white, male-dominant organisational culture still prevails,\" said South Africa's labour minister, Mildred Oliphant, commenting on these findings. Senior management roles - a level down - follow a similar pattern, although the level of non-white participation is slightly higher. Of these positions, 56% are filled by white South Africans. For the third tier defined by the equality commission - those with professional qualifications filling mid-management positions - there's evidence of a further trend towards greater non-white participation. Here, non-white workers hold more than half of the positions. A decade ago, white workers filled the majority of these jobs. Who controls the largest companies? Another measure of empowerment is to look not at who works for the country's leading companies, but who owns them. According to figures reported to South Africa's black economic empowerment commission, black ownership of companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in 2017 was 27%. However, the data for this is only partial. Fewer than half of the companies listed on the JSE provided the information asked for. The commission itself has expressed frustration at the slow pace of change. Its head, Zodwa Ntuli, says progress towards towards black empowerment has been \"insignificant compared to where we should be.\" One more indication of the skewed nature of ownership comes from analysis carried out by the National Empowerment Fund - a body set up by the government to support black business - which looks at companies listed on the JSE. By this measure, just 3% of the biggest firms are controlled by black South Africans.

In the UK, this absence of data has led regulators to exclude pregnant and breastfeeding women from vaccination programmes. In the US, the decision has been left up to these women themselves. Here's why the two countries are split, and what that means for pregnant women. What does the data say? So far, it doesn't say much at all. \"There were no data, period,\" said Dr Ruth Faden, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University, who specialises in the rights and health of pregnant women. There is no suggestion that the jab is especially risky for pregnant and lactating women, there just isn't yet enough information to say. Pfizer has said it followed the guidance of the US Food and Drug Administration in leaving out pregnant and breastfeeding women from its clinical trials. These women will not be included in clinical trials until the company completes so-called Dart studies (developmental and reproductive toxicity), often conducted in animals. Experts say this is customary. \"In non-pandemic times, if you are talking about a brand new vaccine, most reasonable people who are committed to advancing the interests of pregnant women and their offspring would still say we should not involve pregnant women\" in early clinical trials, Dr Faden said. \"You can't put them in right from the beginning\". In bioethics, pregnant women are described as \"a complex population\", Dr Faden said. \"Nowhere else do you have two entities at one time, both of whom are objects of moral concern.\" \"And by and large, no one cares more about the well-being of the offspring than the pregnant woman. The first question you usually get is 'will this be safe for my baby?'\" she said. But the decision to leave out pregnant women from clinical trials is more complicated in the midst of a pandemic. \"We're in a tough place,\" said Dr Emily Stinnett Miller, an obstetrician at Northwestern University and a member of the Covid-19 task force of the Society for Maternal and Fetal Medicine. \"They're having to make critical decisions quickly, and there are pros and cons to inclusion and exclusion.\" A serious con - a lack of data - is evident now. \"We don't really have the data to make these clinical decisions that we need to make,\" Dr Miller said. Why do the UK and US differ? Faced with the same lack of data, the UK and US are split in their policy response. \"When you have no data that speaks specifically to the question, then the next question is to step back and say 'OK, what otherwise do we know?'\" Dr Faden said. The UK has taken the more cautious path. On its website, Public Health England said that while the evidence \"raises no concerns for safety in pregnancy\", the agency \"wants to see more non-clinical data\" before finalising its advice for pregnancy. \"As specific clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women have not yet been carried out, there isn't sufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of Covid-19 vaccines to pregnant or breastfeeding women,\" said Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), in a statement. Experts in the US went another way, leaving the the decision of vaccination to pregnant and breastfeeding women. \"The experts came to a consensus view that scientific plausibility of harm just wasn't there,\" Dr Faden said. But, she cautioned, \"that doesn't mean zero\". The Covid vaccine trials may have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any steps, regulators in the US and UK have said, and approval is only given when a vaccine is both safe and effective. Where does that leave pregnant women? In both countries, pregnant and lactating women will have to wait for more information before getting a clearer recommendation on the vaccine. Preliminary results from Pfizer's developmental and reproductive toxicity studies are expected by the end of the year. Once these studies are complete, the company may expand its clinical trials to include pregnant women. There are also a handful of women who became pregnant while in the midst of the trial who will be monitored through their pregnancy. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has urged the UK government to fund research studies on the vaccine and its suitability for pregnant and breastfeeding women. And data will also be collected from pregnant and breastfeeding women in the US who elect to take the vaccine in the coming months. This will come first from the country's healthcare workers - among the first in the US to be eligible - some 330,000 of whom are estimated to be pregnant or breastfeeding. \"We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that this data...will allow an unambiguous, full-throated recommendation on pregnancy,\" Dr Faden said. In the meantime, some pregnant and breastfeeding women say they will avoid the jab. Joanna Sullivan, 35, who lives in southwest Ohio, is expecting her first baby in June. She does not plan to seek the vaccine until after she gives birth. \"I don't know about any kind of complications, and being my first one, being older, there's already higher risk there,\" she said. And while it would be \"helpful\" to see how other pregnant women respond, Mrs Sullivan said she will likely hold off. In Gloucestershire, England, Amy Collender, 34, said she might consider the jab while breastfeeding, but only now that her son is nearly two years old. \"If I had a newborn baby, I might not,\" she said. And if she were still pregnant, she would likely choose to opt-out. And both women said that while they'd like more information, they would not volunteer to participate in a clinical trial themselves. \"That's the thing, I understand why there weren't pregnant people doing the trial,\" Mrs Sullivan said. \"Who wants to put their baby at risk?\" But according to Dr Faden, successful inoculation against Covid-19 means that pregnant and breastfeeding must be included. \"We cannot have an effective vaccine against this pandemic unless we have a vaccine that pregnant women can take, full stop,\" Dr Faden said.", "summary": "Alors que le vaccin tant attendu contre le coronavirus commence à se mettre en place, il est déjà clair que tout le monde n'y aura pas accès.

Police say they have evidence Sinaga, 36, who is being named for the first time, targeted at least 190 victims. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Sinaga was \"the most prolific rapist in British legal history\". The judge ruled his life sentence must include a minimum of 30 years in jail. Reporting restrictions were also lifted at a sentencing hearing at Manchester Crown Court on Monday, meaning Sinaga could be identified for the first time. The post-graduate student was already serving life, with a minimum term of 20 years, for the offences he was convicted of in two earlier trials, which took place in summer 2018 and last spring. Across four separate trials, the Indonesian national was found guilty of 136 counts of rape, eight counts of attempted rape, 14 counts of sexual assault, and one count of assault by penetration, against a total of 48 victims. Detectives say they have been unable to identify a further 70 victims and are now appealing for anyone who believes they may have been abused by Sinaga to come forward. At the hearing, Judge Suzanne Goddard QC said Sinaga was \"an evil serial sexual predator who has preyed upon young men\" who wanted \"nothing more than a good night out with their friends\". \"In my judgment you are a highly dangerous, cunning and deceitful individual who will never be safe to be released,\" she said - adding that the decision to release prisoners is made by the Parole Board. Sinaga would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his flat in Montana House, Princess Street, often with the offer of somewhere to have a drink or call a taxi. He drugged his victims before assaulting them while they were unconscious. When the victims woke up many of them had no memory of what had happened. The student, who denied the charges, had claimed all the sexual activity was consensual and that each man had agreed to being filmed while pretending to be asleep - a defence described by the judge as \"ludicrous\". At an earlier sentencing, the judge said she was sure that Sinaga had used a form of date rape drug such as GHB. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"deeply concerned\" by the use of such a drug. In victim impact statements read out in court, one victim said Sinaga had \"destroyed a part of my life\", while another said: \"I hope he never comes out of prison and he rots in hell.\" \"I have periods where I can't get up and face the day,\" another added. Many of the victims were unaware they had been raped until they were contacted by police. Lisa Waters, of the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, where victims received support, said some men found this \"very difficult to process\", with some experiencing mental health issues and suicidal thoughts. Sinaga, who was studying for a PHD at the University of Leeds, carried out his attacks over several years. The rapist was caught in June 2017 when one victim, who regained consciousness while being assaulted, fought Sinaga off and called the police. When officers seized Sinaga's phone they found he had filmed each of his attacks - amounting to hundreds of hours of footage. The discovery led to the launch of the largest rape inquiry in British history. Assistant Chief Constable Mabbs Hussain said the true extent of Sinaga's offending would probably never be known. \"We suspect he's offended over a period of 10 years,\" he said. \"The information and evidence we are going from is largely from trophies that he's collected from the victims of his crimes.\" Investigators traced dozens of victims from the videos using clues found in Sinaga's Manchester flat, such as stolen phones, ID cards and watches. The University of Manchester, where Sinaga was previously a student, said some members of its community had been \"directly affected\" by the case and it had set up a dedicated confidential phone line to offer support. A statement from Vice-Chancellor Dame Nancy Rothwell, said the news was \"profoundly distressing\" and her thoughts were with all those affected. 'Staggering tally' Judge Goddard said the \"scale and enormity\" of Sinaga's offending meant it was \"accurate\" for one of his victims to have described him as a monster. She added that Sinaga had shown \"not a jot of remorse\" and at times appeared to be \"actually enjoying the trial process\". Following the sentencing, Ian Rushton, from the CPS, said Sinaga was \"the most prolific rapist in British legal history\" and possibly \"in the world\". \"His extreme sense of sexual entitlement almost defies belief and he would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught,\" he said. He added that he thought Sinaga took \"a particular pleasure in preying on heterosexual men\". Home Secretary Priti Patel said in response to Sinaga's \"truly sickening crimes\" she had asked an independent council to prioritise a review into whether controls for drugs like GHB were \"tough enough\". GHB (gammahydroxybutyrate) is a class C drug. Anyone found in possession of it can be imprisoned for up to two years. Sinaga's trials took place across 18 months at Manchester Crown Court, resulting in unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges. His convictions relate to crimes he committed from January 2015 to June 2017, but police believe he began offending years earlier. Greater Manchester Police said anyone who believes they might have been attacked by Sinaga can report information online or call its police line on 0800 092 0410 from inside the UK or 0207 158 0124 from abroad. The force said anyone in need of support from specialist agencies could call 0800 056 0154 from within the UK or 0207 158 0011 from abroad.

There's no evidence so far that this plant - whose compounds do work against malaria - can combat Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). So what do we know about the plant and its properties? Where does the plant come from? Artemisia annua is originally from Asia, but grows in many other parts of the world with sunny and warm conditions. It's been used in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 2,000 years for treating a number of diseases, including malaria, as well as to relieve pain and combat fever. In Chinese medicine, it is known as \"qinghao.\" It is also called sweet wormwood or annual wormwood, and is used as an alternative therapy - and even put into some alcoholic drinks. Could artemisia work against Covid-19? President Rajoelina of Madagascar said in April this year that trials conducted on the Covid-Organics drink - which uses artemisia - showed its effectiveness against the disease. He repeated this claim in September. But no evidence has been shown publicly for this. And the exact composition of the drink is not known, although the government says more than 60% is derived from the artemisia plant. Madagascar has also started producing capsules and a solution that can be injected, on which clinical trials have begun. German and Danish scientists have been testing extracts from artemisia annua plants, which they say showed some effectiveness against the new coronavirus in a laboratory setting. The research - which hasn't been independently reviewed by other scientists - found that these extracts showed anti-viral activity when used with pure ethanol or distilled water. These researchers are working with the University of Kentucky to carry out human clinical trials at some stage. China has been conducting its own tests, based on traditional medicines that use the artemisia annua plant. And scientists in South Africa have been doing laboratory tests on artemisia annua and another variety of the plant - artemisia afra - for effectiveness against Covid-19. But there are no results as yet. What does the WHO say about artemisia? The WHO says it hasn't yet had detailed information about the Madagascar tests. Jean-Baptiste Nikiema of the WHO's Africa region told the BBC the organisation may get involved later on in trials - depending on what information they get about the early trials. At the moment, the WHO says there is no evidence that artemisia-derived products work against Covid-19. It adds that all medicinal plants \"should be tested for efficacy and adverse side-effects\" through rigorous clinical trials. How is it used against malaria? The active ingredient found in the dried leaves of artemisia annua is called artemisinin, and it does work against malaria. Chinese scientists pioneered the discovery of its properties when they were searching for a cure for malaria in the 1970s. Artemisinin-based combination therapies - known for short as ACTs - are recommended by the WHO against malaria, especially those types now resistant to chloroquine, which is one of the main drug treatments for the disease. ACTs contain derivatives of artemisinin combined with other substances, and these reduce the number of malaria parasites in the body. Increased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been cited as a key factor in helping reduce the global toll of the disease in the last 15 years. What are the risks of drug resistance? Because artemisia annua extracts have started appearing more widely as remedies for malaria, such as in tea, there's concern that unregulated usage could allow the malaria parasite to develop resistance. There are a number of countries in south-east Asia where this resistance has already been observed. \"We know that over time the [malaria] parasite will start to resist, but this time [period] needs to be as long as possible,\" says Jean-Baptiste Nikiema of the WHO. The WHO now discourages the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of artemisinin, concerned that it could lead to growing malarial resistance.

She told the BBC how a gang tried to lure her away from her home two years ago: It was a Friday. Five men and one woman came here at about 7 o'clock in the evening. They arrived when I was in the kitchen preparing our supper and my husband was outside here. They told him that they were looking for me. That they were policemen, and had come to protect me because they had got a tip that some people were looking for me to kill me. I was scared because these were total strangers. I had never seen them before. There was such commotion here that some of our neighbours gathered. And although they said they were policemen, they were not wearing uniform. I wasn't convinced at first, but then they mentioned the name of the police chief from this area. We even asked them to describe the police chief, and they did. In fact, they showed us guns and even identity cards. But of course we could not know whether they were genuine or not. That is when my husband and I, and some of the neighbours agreed to go with them to the police unit. When we got there, the police post was locked. The five who claimed to be police officers called three other people from a nearby bar. And they now tried to force my husband and me to go to a station further from our area. It was very strange because they sent away anyone else that was curious and wanted to stop by. So it was just me, my husband, and the neighbours who had come with us. My husband insisted that they shouldn't take me away by myself. He kept arguing with them that we hadn't committed any crime; why were we going to be taken to a police station? When they realised we had decided to stand our ground, they were very angry, and they just left. I have never seen them again since that day - we know the policemen that operate in our area. But those people were strangers to all of us. 'Roof targeted' My life has completely changed since then. I have got eight children, some of whom to go secondary school. Before the incident, I could go to the place where we buy vegetables in bulk, and I would go door to door selling them. Now I am always afraid to move deep into the township. So all I'm left with is the bench at the market, where I sell from. As a result, I cannot make enough money for my children's school fees, uniforms and even for food, because I have to restrict myself to the market stall. Now some of our children have been sent home from school. I don't feel that the police or government are doing anything to protect people with albinism like me. Albinos under attack in Malawi The albino who confronted a witchdoctor Challenging Africa's albino stereotypes I live by the grace of God. I just thank God when I wake up each morning. I still don't feel safe. For instance last month, one night, some people tried to break into the house through the roof. We woke up and raised an alarm; we came out of the house and shouted. That is when they run away. The community is aware that people like us are at risk; especially the neighbours, and the women at the market. That is why they asked the BBC team lots of questions when you came here, because they know what happened to me, and they don't want it to happen again. When you look at my house, I don't even have good doors to protect me at night. So night time for is me is like day. I am too scared to sleep.

The company apologised for what it described as a \"misstep\" that caused \"offence\". However, Boyega has said Jo Malone was \"wrong\" to have used another actor \"without my consent or prior notice\". Writing on Twitter, the British star said while he accepted that companies would use different representatives around the world, \"dismissively trading out one's culture this way is not something I can condone\". \"The film celebrated my personal story - showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,\" he added. \"It's back to back but I assure you this will be dealt with swiftly. I don't have time for nonsense. We press on and strong. Stay blessed people.\" The recreated advert largely followed the same script, but featured Chinese star Liu Haoran instead of Boyega. The original version, titled London Gent, showed Boyega hanging out with friends and family in Peckham, where he grew up. They were also removed for Chinese audiences. Jo Malone, owned by Estee Lauder, has since removed the advert from its campaign in China. \"We deeply apologise for what, on our end, was a mistake in the local execution of the John Boyega campaign,\" they said in statement on Monday. Boyega's sister Grace posted the Chinese version of the advert in a Twitter response. 'Taking this misstep very seriously' In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Jo Malone London said: \"John is a tremendous artist with great personal vision and direction. The concept for the film was based on John's personal experiences and should not have been replicated. \"While we immediately took action and removed the local version of the campaign, we recognise that this was painful and that offence was caused,\" it added. \"We respect John, and support our partners and fans globally. We are taking this misstep very seriously and we are working together as a brand to do better moving forward.\" 'Pushed to the side' It's not the first time Boyega has fallen foul of editing for the Chinese market. There was controversy back in 2016 when Disney unveiled a re-versioned movie poster for Star Wars: The Force Awakens in China. Boyega's new lead character Finn was shrunken in size, compared with the original poster. Earlier this month, the star called for an end to black actors being \"pushed to the side\" by film companies. Writers, actors and directors including JK Rowling and Jordan Peele also praised the 28-year-old for his emotional speech at a Black Lives Matter protest in the summer.

The news was broken by celebrity news website TMZ after months of rumours of marital difficulties. Reports in US media suggest the reality star, 40, has requested joint legal and physical custody of their children. Neither has publicly commented. The couple are among the most recognisable stars in the world and are both hugely successful in their own right. Kim first found fame in 2007 as the star of an E! Television reality series about her family. Keeping up with the Kardashians has remained hugely popular since, with its 21st and final series due to air next year. The reality star has found success in many other areas of business, from mobile apps to make-up, and Forbes estimates her personal wealth to be about $780m (£556m). Known for huge international hits like Gold Digger, Kanye West has been one of the biggest names in rap music for over 15 years. The Grammy-winning musician has also found success as a fashion designer. The pair were friends for years before they got together and West first appeared on her family's reality show in 2010. Their first daughter, North, arrived in June 2013. West famously hired the San Francisco Giants' baseball stadium and an orchestra to propose to her in front of her family, and their show's cameras, later that year. They got married in Italy in May 2014 and a photograph of them kissing on their wedding day became, at the time, Instagram's most liked post ever. By this point she and her sisters had turned social media into an art form, with their online followings propelling their business success and fame ever further. Kardashian gave birth to the couple's first son, Saint West, the following year. They went on to have two other children, Chicago and Psalm, through a surrogate after the reality star suffered from health complications during her previous pregnancies. The couple have rarely been away from tabloid headlines since, most notably when Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016. Last year, West unsuccessfully ran for US president. During his campaign, a series of erratic public appearances and online postings by the rapper sparked concern and led Kardashian to speak out. She said her husband had bipolar disorder, was a \"brilliant but complicated person\" and called for greater empathy surrounding his mental health from the public and the media. Rumours of their divorce have been around for months amid speculation Kardashian had hired well-known lawyer Laura Wasser. Page Six reported the filing was imminent in January, claiming West spent the festive season away from the California-based family at his Wyoming ranch.

State and federal agencies are now working to match his confessions with the deaths of dozens of women across the country from 1970 to 2005. Investigators say they have already linked him to 34 murders and are working to corroborate many others. Little is currently serving life in prison after being sentenced in 2014 for the murders of three women. He has been in custody since September 2012 when he was arrested at a Kentucky homeless shelter and transferred to California where he was wanted on a drugs charge. DNA samples taken from Little were then linked to the unsolved deaths of three women in Los Angeles county in 1987 and 1989. All three of those victims had been beaten and strangled before their bodies were dumped separately. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually sentenced to three consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole. Before that he already had an extensive criminal record, with offences including rape and armed robbery. The murder convictions led to Little being referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) - a scheme that works to analyse serial offenders of violent and sexual crimes, and share information with local law enforcement agencies to cross-reference unsolved crimes. Officials from the programme say they then uncovered an \"alarming pattern\" and \"compelling links\" to many more murders across the US. One unsolved cold-case murder in Odessa, Texas of a woman named Denise Christie Brothers was then pursued by local authorities. A local ranger, James Holland, then travelled to California with ViCAP team members earlier this year to interview Little. They say Little agreed to talk to them because he was hoping to move prisons. The FBI say that Little has confessed to 90 killings in total - stretching states across the breadth of the US, from California to Maryland. The ViCap team said in a news release earlier this week they had so far established his ties to 34 deaths, with many others apparently pending confirmation. \"Over the course of that interview in May, he went through city and state and gave Ranger Holland the number of people he killed in each place. Jackson, Mississippi - one; Cincinnati, Ohio - one; Phoenix, Arizona - three; Las Vegas, Nevada - one,\" ViCAP Crime Analyst Christina Palazzolo said in the report. They believe Little particularly targeted marginalised and vulnerable women who were involved in prostitution or addicted to drugs. Investigators say their bodies were often left unidentified and their deaths un-investigated by authorities. \"Little's method of killing also didn't always leave obvious signs that the death was a homicide. The one-time competitive boxer usually stunned or knocked out his victims with powerful punches and then strangled them,\" the FBI report said. \"With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,\" it continued. A large number are believed to have taken place in the 1970s and early 1980s before DNA technology was available to police. Beth Silverman, the Los Angeles County prosecutor who helped convict Little in 2014, told the New York Times that \"a lot of agencies around the country...dropped the ball on this case\". \"He got off over and over and over again,\" she told the newspaper. The FBI says the 78-year-old is \"in poor health\" and is likely to now remain in prison in Texas until his death, where he was transferred from California after admitting the Odessa killing. The bureau says it is continuing to work alongside Ranger Holland, who is said to be interviewing Little \"nearly daily\", to help build an accurate and full picture of his crimes. \"The biggest lesson in this case is the power of information sharing,\" Kevin Fitzsimmons, ViCAP's supervisory crime analyst said in the FBI report. \"A Jane Doe [unidentified victim] who turned up dead in an alley in New Orleans may look like an isolated event but when entered into the ViCAP database and examined with other mysterious deaths or missing persons, patterns emerge. That is the value of ViCAP.\"", "summary": "Un homme emprisonné pour meurtre fait l'objet d'une enquête après avoir avoué 90 meurtres durant quatre décennies aux États-Unis."}

The 33-year-old is already on bail over an alleged rape case dating back to 2016 and was arrested in 2010 on suspicion of another assault. His hit Lmaallem is the most-viewed song by an Arab artist on YouTube. It has been seen more than 650 million times. Mr Lamjarred had been placed in police custody on Sunday. Prosecutors in the south-eastern city of Draguignan, near Saint-Tropez, had told AFP news agency the latest case was \"complex\" and involved two \"radically opposed versions of events\". But it was announced on Tuesday that Mr Lamjarred was now under formal investigation for rape and a magistrate would decide in the evening whether he would continue to be detained. What happened in the previous cases? Mr Lamjarred was first arrested on suspicion of beating and raping a woman in New York in 2010. He fled the US while on bail and has not returned since. Six years later, he was accused of physically assaulting and raping a young French woman in a hotel in Paris. He was released on bail with an electronic tag in April 2017 awaiting trial. Shortly before his release, French newspaper Le Parisien reported that a French-Moroccan woman had been physically assaulted by Mr Lamjarred in the Moroccan city of Casablanca two years earlier. She said she reported the incident to the police but later withdrew the complaint under pressure from her family. What has the reaction been? Perhaps surprisingly in the age of #MeToo, previous cases against Mr Lamjarred have done little to damage his reputation among fans. When the singer was arrested in 2016, the Moroccan king himself intervened to cover the singer's legal fees. Many of Mr Lamjarred's fans maintain the singer was the victim of a \"plot\" by neighbouring Algeria, which has strained relations with Morocco. Moroccan media even showed footage of small protests \"in solidarity\" with the singer during his detention. The first song he released one year after the alleged incident - and dedicated to the king - showed just how popular he remained, gaining over 140m views. What about the victims? The victim of the alleged assault in Paris spoke out in November last year, when she uploaded a video on YouTube (in French), and detailed the abuse she had experienced online. \"My name is Laura Prioul, I'm 21 years old, and it has been one year since I was physically attacked, hit and raped. \"For the past year I've been hiding from the media, hiding from everyone, that everyone's been talking about me.\" She recounted details of the alleged assault and described the death threats she received after her identity was revealed online. \"So many people were talking about me, insulting me, and no-one supported me apart from my family and friends.\" Mr Lamjarred has denied Laura Prioul's allegation of rape.", "summary": "Le chanteur marocain Saad Lamjarred a été arrêté dans le sud de la France pour de nouvelles allégations de viol."}

Small and slightly hunched over, he looks wistfully into space as he sits on a tightly packed bench inside a stuffy prison visitor's room. Dressed in a white T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops, he lifts his head slowly - his way of acknowledging our presence. But otherwise he remains quiet during our visit - in stark contrast to the rest of the room that is filled with loud chatter at Enugu Maximum Security Prison in south-east Nigeria. His son Paul Egbunuche, 41, sits protectively close to him - and does the talking. He is in jail on the same murder charge. They were both accused of hiring people to kidnap and kill a man over an alleged land dispute in Imo state. Paul maintains their innocence. They were detained in June 2000 and eventually convicted and sentenced to death in 2014. It has not been possible to contact the family of the man who was killed - even the Nigeria prison service has been unable to find them. 'Confused and childlike' As prison officials look on, he tells me that his father isn't really able to talk much any more and is no longer aware of his surroundings. \"When you ask him something, he says something else. The doctor told me that it is his age, he has become like a little pikin [child]. \"There are some times when he will ask me: 'These people here [inmates], what are they doing here?'\" Paul says he rarely leaves his father's side now; he has been his primary carer since his health began to deteriorate in prison. These health problems include diabetes and failing eyesight - and Paul uses what he can to manage them. \"The only thing I'm using to manage him is food, unripe plantain, and they [officials] give him some drugs.\" Birthday photo Father and son share a cell with other death-row prisoners, who are separated from the general population. \"When I wake up in the morning, I will boil water and bath him,\" Paul says. \"I'll change his clothes then prepare food for him. If they open up [the cell] I'll take him out so the sun will touch him. \"I'm always close to him, discussing with him and playing with him.\" Paul says the other inmates sometimes help him care for his father and that many of them want his father to be released. It was after his father's 100th birthday on 4 August that events were set in motion that may lead to his release. A photo of Paul and a frail looking Egbunuche went viral in August after a local paper did a story about him turning 100 in jail. It sparked a debate about the length of time Nigerians spend on death row and the place of capital punishment altogether. The latest figures from the Nigerian Prisons Service show that more than 2,000 people are on death row in Nigeria, many of whom spend years waiting to be executed. The death sentence is not commonly carried out in Nigeria. Between 2007 and 2017, there were seven executions - the last one taking place in 2016, Amnesty International reports. Poverty and punishment However, the death penalty is still meted out by judges for offences like treason, kidnapping and armed robbery. \"You have people who have spent 30 years on death row, it's common,\" says Pamela Okoroigwe, a lawyer for the Legal Defence and Assistance Project (LEDAP). \"Governors are reluctant to sign [death warrants] and they're not willing to grant pardons - that's why we have a high number of death-row inmates.\" Ms Okoroigwe says death row is a \"punishment for the poor\" and one that a growing number of Nigerians want abolished. \"Have you ever seen a rich man on death row?\" she asks. \"How many people can afford to get a lawyer to represent them in court? A rich man who ended up in court can afford to get the best and he'll be free.\" You may also like: This sentiment is shared by Franklin Ezeona, president of the Global Society for Anti-Corruption (GSAC), the non-governmental organisation that brought Egbunuche's case to the public and has been petitioning for his pardon. \"If the man was the father of a governor or a minister, I don't think he would still be in prison,\" Mr Ezeona says. \"Poverty in most of African countries hinders justice.\" He says it is unreasonable to keep people waiting for years on death row as \"the trauma and the torture is too much\". 'Everyone deserves a second chance' Mr Ezeona says that he hopes that Egbunuche's case will prompt the government to review other cases and shine a light on the justice system as a whole. \"It will be good for the correctional system. It will show that with good behaviour, the government can give you a second chance.\" \"Everyone deserves a second chance.\" And Egbunuche may get a second chance as he has been recommended for a pardon by Imo state's attorney general, Miletus Nlemedim. It is now awaiting approval from Governor Rochas Okorocha. Mr Nlemedim says numerous factors are taken into consideration when an inmate is recommended for pardon - age, time served and the approval of the prison staff. The family of the victim has not been consulted about a possible release. \"What we do as a government is to try to remove ourselves from sentiment,\" he says. According to Mr Nlemedim, the state's Ministry of Happiness offers the chance for reconciliation after a prisoner is released. In this case Mr Ezeona says it may be unlikely to happen given the length of time that has passed and poor record-keeping. Nonetheless, he is still confident Celestine Egbunuche will be pardoned. \"If we can't pardon a centenarian, who can we pardon?\" he says. Paul too is confident that his father will be pardoned - and is hopeful that he too will get a reprieve so he can care for him. \"It's good for him to be released.

The chants, which came after Mr Trump criticised Ms Omar and three other congresswomen, were widely condemned, including by some Republicans. \"I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,\" Mr Trump said of the chant. He did not elaborate on what he disagreed with. \"It was quite a chant and I felt a little bit badly about it,\" Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"I started speaking very quickly but it started up rather fast, as you probably noticed.\" The controversial chants took place at Mr Trump's campaign rally in North Carolina. Mr Trump was cheered on by the crowd of thousands as he again accused Ms Omar and her fellow congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashia Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley - known as \"the squad\" - of hating America. Ahead of the rally, a bid to impeach Mr Trump was blocked in Congress. Critics say it echoed the \"lock her up\" phrase adopted by his supporters against Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The chant comes as tensions escalate between the president and the four Democratic congresswomen over recent tweets, in which Mr Trump told the then four politicians to \"go back\" to their countries. What's the reaction? Ms Omar told reporters on Thursday: \"Every single person who is in this country, who's aspiring to become part of the American fabric understands that nothing this president says should be taken to heart.\" \"As he's spewing his fascist ideology on stage, telling US citizens to go back because they don't agree with his detrimental policies for our country, we tell people that here in the US dissent is patriotic, here in the US disagreement is welcome.\" On Wednesday, Ms Omar tweeted lines from Maya Angelou's poem Still I Rise and later shared a photo of herself in the House of Representatives saying, \"I am where I belong\". On Twitter, #IStandWithIlhan began trending as Democrats expressed their support for Ms Omar and criticised the president for prompting the chants with his rhetoric. Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: \"Trump is stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society\" while Senator Kamala Harris, another Democratic 2020 contender, described the actions as \"vile\". Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer drew comparisons to dictatorships. Some conservatives have also censured the use of the phrase. Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Tom Emmer - who, like Ms Omar, represents Minnesota in Congress - told reporters he did not agree with the language. \"There's no place for that kind of talk,\" Mr Emmer said, according to Politico. He said the chant was \"not acceptable\". North Carolina congressman Mark Walker said that he \"struggled\" with the chant and that the focus should be on \"her history, words & actions\" instead of \"phrasing that's painful to our friends in the minority communities\". His fellow Republican Adam Kinzinger said the chants were \"ugly\". Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said \"chanting for her deportation based on her exercise of the First Amendment is disgusting\". Senator Lindsay Graham, a vocal Trump supporter, defended the president, though he said he wished Mr Trump would focus on \"policies not the personality\". \"I've said before that if you're a Somali refugee wearing a Maga hat, he doesn't want to send you back. You'd probably have dinner at the White House,\" Mr Graham told reporters. Republican leader Mitch McConnell told the Fox Business Network on Thursday that Mr Trump is \"on to something\" by attacking the four congresswomen as their policies will be important in the upcoming election. \"We're in a big debate now and next year about what we want America to be like. Do we really think socialism applies here at a time of great prosperity, 50-year-low unemployment?\" A recipe for a toxic campaign Three years ago, crowds at Donald Trump rallies called for the imprisonment of a political adversary. On Wednesday, they chanted for a member of the opposition party to be expelled from the country. These are not behaviours emblematic of a healthy, well-functioning democracy. The president's defenders have parsed his incendiary language in an effort to explain why telling people to \"go back\" to the \"totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" is not simply the latest iteration of age-old racist invective. It was, they insist, just a Trumpian twist on \"love it or leave it\" sloganeering. When the rhetoric filters down to the president's vocal crowds, however, such nuance is lost. Mr Trump is an instinctual politician who senses weakness and opportunity and often acts before a strategy is fully formed. The goal, however, is clear. He is both trying to sow divisions within Democratic ranks and rile up a base whose enthusiastic turnout will be needed in the coming election. Such a course is not without risk, however. His actions could motivate and unify opponents as much as they do his base. It's a recipe for a toxic, divisive campaign that will get ugly - and fast. What else has Mr Trump said? In an interview with the Daily Mail just before the Greenville rally, Mr Trump said he was \"not unhappy\" with the way the row has played out and said he believes he is \"winning the political fight...by a lot\". \"I'm not relishing the fight,\" Mr Trump said. \"I'm enjoying it because I have to get the word out to the American people. And you have to enjoy what you do. I enjoy what I do.\" What's the background? In a series of tweets on Sunday, the president said the four congresswomen - who he did not identify - \"originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe\" and should \"go back\". The president has denied accusations that the tweets were racist, but the Democrat-controlled House passed a symbolic resolution denouncing Mr Trump's \"racist comments that have legitimised fear and hatred of New Americans and people of colour\". A July poll by the Pew Research Center found that while 62% of overall Americans believe openness to people from around the world is \"essential to who we are as a nation\", 57% of Republicans said the US risks \"losing our identity as a nation\" if it is too open. Earlier on Wednesday, a bid to launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump was blocked in the US House of Representatives after it failed to win enough support, with only 95 Democrats voting in favour.

Normal bricks need to be baked in high-temperature kilns that produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. 'As hard as limestone' The engineering students at the University of Cape Town (UCT) have been harvesting urine from men's toilets. After first making a solid fertiliser, the leftover liquid is then used in a biological process \"to grow\" what the university calls \"bio-bricks\". The process is called microbial carbonate precipitation. The bacteria produces an enzyme that breaks down urea in the urine, forming calcium carbonate, which then binds the sand into rock hard, grey bricks. How many loo breaks to make a brick? (These are all rough calculations from the bio-brick and fertiliser urine project.) The strength and shape of the bio-bricks can be altered as required. \"When we first started this process last year, we achieved the same compressibility strength as a 40% limestone brick,\" Dr Randall told the BBC Newsday programme. \"Just a few months later we've doubled that strength now just by changing the material we put into the mould and allowing the bacteria to cement the particles for longer - with zero heat, at room temperature.\" Regular bricks are kiln-fired at temperatures around 1,400C (2,552F), according to the University of Cape Town. But Dr Randall admits their process is much smellier. \"Say you had a pet and it peed in the corner, and you have that strong smell - that's ammonia being released. This process produces ammonia as a by-product,\" he said, adding that this ammonia is then converted into nitrogen-rich fertiliser. You may also like: But after about 48 hours, the bricks completely lose the ammonia smell - and they do not have any health risks either, he said. \"The process we use in stage one kills all harmful pathogens and bacteria because we operate at an extremely high pH that has been shown to kill pretty much everything.\" According to UCT, the concept of using urea to grow bricks was tested in the US some years ago using synthetic urea, which requires a lot of energy to produce. The bricks produced by Dr Randall and his students, Suzanne Lambert and Vukheta Mukhari, use real human urine for the first time, which offers opportunities for recycling waste.

He is accused of assaulting a woman who worked in a massage parlour but he says the case is politically motivated to stop him running again in elections. Mr Sall denies this and has appealed for calm, asking protesters to leave the issue to the courts. At least eight people have been killed in the protests, the most serious Senegal has seen in several years. After Mr Sonko was released on Monday, he called for much larger protests but made a point that they should be peaceful and that he was not looking to overthrow the president. \"We are not asking the people to go and unseat Macky Sall... But let's be clear, the revolution is marching its way to 2024,\" Mr Sonko is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying, referring to the next presidential election. Mr Sall also addressed the issue on Monday, for the first time, in a televised speech. He said that young people were taking to the streets because they don't have jobs. He promised extra funding for entrepreneurship and to shorten the nightly curfew, imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has stifled the informal economy, Reuters adds. How significant are the protests? On Sunday a top Senegalese official whose job is to settle conflicts, Alioune Badara Cissé, said the authorities \"need to pause and speak with our youth\" and warned that \"we are on the verge of an apocalypse\". Before Monday's hearing, in which Mr Sonko was released on bail, demonstrators scuffled with security forces outside court in the capital, Dakar. Police had deployed armoured cars and tear gas was also fired at protesters in central Dakar on Monday, after protesters pelted officers with stones. An opposition collective known as the Movement for the Defence of Democracy had called for three days of mass protests, starting on Monday but the situation was much calmer than in previous days. Schools in the capital have also been ordered to close for a week following the unrest. Why are these protests so serious? Mr Sonko's arrest is seen as a \"lightning rod for much broader discontent and frustrations,\" Francois Rouget of security consultancy Control Risks told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"These [protests] come at a difficult economic time - there are lots of frustrations coming from curfews that have been imposed to tackle coronavirus, so we are seeing a lot of convergences in grievances,\" he said. Much of Mr Sonko's support comes from the large group of young Senegalese who feel disillusioned about their prospect of finding work. A lot of the anger is also directed at President Sall, who is being accused of using the judiciary for his political aims. Two other opposition leaders were excluded from the 2019 election after convictions which they say were politically motivated. Mr Sonko is currently the country's only major opposition leader. There are also suspicions that Mr Sall will try and stand for a third term in the next presidential election. Why are French interests being attacked? France is the largest trading partner and investor in Senegal, and French companies are accused of stifling local-owned businesses. French-owned supermarket chain Auchan said on Friday that there had been attacks on 14 of its 32 stores across the country. Protesters have also attacked other French-owned companies such as Total petrol stations, Air France offices and Orange mobile phone outlets. Protesters consider France, the former colonial ruler, a strong ally of President Sall. Who is Ousmane Sonko? A 46-year-old former tax inspector, he was fired in 2016 after making allegations of tax anomalies against the president's brother, Aliou Sall. Mr Sonko had at that point already become involved in politics, forming his Pastef party in 2014, and was elected to parliament in 2017. His parliamentary immunity was removed last week, after he was accused of rape by a 20-year-old woman, who says she has since received death threats. Mr Sonko's critics dismiss him as a demagogue and agitator but he is popular with young people for his pan-African rhetoric and condemnation of France's continued economic role in Senegal. Mr Sonko grew up in the southern town of Bignona, which has seen some of the worst violence.", "summary": "Depuis l'arrestation mercredi de l'opposant Ousmane Sonko, des heurts ont éclaté dans plusieurs villes du Sénégal pour exiger sa libération.

Scientists say the figure is \"worrying\", as wild coffee is critical for sustaining the global coffee crop. About one in five of the world's plants is threatened with extinction, and the 60% figure is an \"extremely high\" one. \"If it wasn't for wild species we wouldn't have as much coffee to drink in the world today,\" said Dr Aaron Davis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. \"Because if you look at the history of coffee cultivation, we have used wild species to make the coffee crop sustainable.\" Research published in the journal, Science Advances, found conservation measures were \"inadequate\" for wild coffees, including those considered \"critical\" for long-term global coffee production. The study found that 75 wild coffee species are considered threatened with extinction, 35 are not threatened and too little is known about the remaining 14 to make any judgement. Furthermore, it was found that 28% of wild coffee species grow outside protected areas and only about half are preserved in seed banks. A second study, in Global Change Biology, found that wild Arabica coffee can be classed as threatened under official (IUCN Red List) rankings, when climate change projections are taken into account. Its natural population is likely to shrink by up to 50% or more by 2088 because of climate change alone, according to the research. Wild Arabica is used to supply seeds for coffee farming and also as a harvested crop in its own right. Ethiopia is the home of Arabica coffee, where it grows naturally in upland rainforests. \"Given the importance of Arabica coffee to Ethiopia, and to the world, we need to do our utmost to understand the risks facing its survival in the wild,\" said Dr Tadesse Woldemariam Gole, of the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum in Addis Ababa. What is wild coffee and why do we need it? Many coffee drinkers are unaware that we only use the coffee beans from two species - Coffea Arabica and Coffea robusta - in the thousands of different blends of coffee on sale. In fact, there are 122 coffee species on top of that which occur naturally in the wild. Many of these wild coffees do not taste good to drink, but may contain genes that can be harnessed to help coffee plants survive in the future, amid climate change and emerging diseases that attack coffee trees. More stories you might like to read: In the longer term, we will need to call on wild species to safeguard the future of the world's coffee crop, say researchers. \"We will call on those wild resources time and time again,\" said Dr Davis. How does coffee compare to other plants in terms of extinction risks? Globally, about one in five plants is threatened with extinction, compared with 60% for coffee. As a comparison, about half of wild tea and mango species are threatened with extinction, 6% of hazelnuts and 9% of pistachios. Where is wild coffee found? The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. What types of coffee do we drink? Global coffee trade relies on two species - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks. What are crop wild relatives? Crop wild relatives are wild plants that are genetically related to cultivated crops. They continue to evolve in the wild, and can be crossed with domesticated crops. They have been used to improve the yields and nutritional quality of crops since the dawn of agriculture. What are scientists calling for? They say we must understand the risks to coffee farming and make sure we have the resources in place to overcome threats. Coffee trees, like many tropical plants, have seeds that do not survive the freeze-drying process used in conventional seed banks - 45% of coffee species have not been \"backed up\" outside the wild. Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha of Kew said this is the first time an IUCN Red List assessment has been carried out to find the extinction risk of the world's coffee, and the figure of 60% is \"extremely high\". \"We hope this new data will highlight species to be prioritised for the sustainability of the coffee production sector, so that appropriate action can be taken to safeguard the species,\" she said.

But experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. And officials stress people should follow the stay-at-home rules - whether or not they have had the virus. 'Save lives' Prof Susan Hopkins, who led the study, said the results were encouraging, suggesting immunity lasted longer than some people feared, but protection was by no means absolute. It was particularly concerning some of those reinfected had high levels of the virus - even without symptoms - and were at risk of passing it on to others, she said. \"This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others,\" she added. \"Now more than ever, it is vital we all stay at home to protect our health service and save lives.\" Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice? From June to November 2020, almost 21,000 healthcare workers across the UK were regularly tested to see whether they: Of those who had no antibodies to the virus, suggesting they may have never had it, 318 developed potential new infections within this timeframe. But among the 6,614 with antibodies, this figure was just 44 potential new infections. Researchers received various different pieces of evidence suggesting these people had become re-infected - including new symptoms more than 90 days after their first infection, new positive swab tests and blood tests. Some tests are still being run and researchers say their results will be updated as they come in. 'Likely boost' Scientists will continue to monitor the healthcare workers for 12 months to see how long immunity lasts. They will also look closely at cases with the new variant - which was not widespread at the time of this first analysis - and observe the immunity of participants who receive the vaccine. Dr Julian Tang, a virus expert at the University of Leicester, said the results were reassuring for healthcare workers. \"Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity,\" he added. \"We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine. \"So hopefully the results from this paper will reduce the anxiety of many healthcare-worker colleagues who have concerns about getting Covid-19 twice.\" In other developments: Related Internet Links Information on SIREN study", "summary": "La plupart des personnes qui ont eu le Covid-19 sont protégées contre une nouvelle infection pendant au moins cinq mois, selon une étude menée par Public Health England."}

Despite warnings about the abuse three years ago, a new report shows it is continuing in the south of the country. UN agencies and charities said they had zero tolerance of exploitation and were not aware of any cases of abuse by partner organisations in the region. Aid workers told the BBC that the exploitation is so widespread that some Syrian women are refusing to go to distribution centres because people would assume they had offered their bodies for the aid they brought home. One worker claimed that some humanitarian agencies were turning a blind eye to the exploitation because using third parties and local officials was the only way of getting aid into dangerous parts of Syria that international staff could not access. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) conducted an assessment of gender based violence in the region last year and concluded that humanitarian assistance was being exchanged for sex in various governorates in Syria. The report, entitled \"Voices from Syria 2018\", said: \"Examples were given of women or girls marrying officials for a short period of time for 'sexual services' in order to receive meals; distributors asking for telephone numbers of women and girls; giving them lifts to their houses 'to take something in return' or obtaining distributions 'in exchange for a visit to her home' or 'in exchange for services, such as spending a night with them'.\" It added: \"Women and girls 'without male protectors', such as widows and divorcees as well as female IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons), were regarded as particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\" Yet this exploitation was first reported three years ago. Danielle Spencer, a humanitarian adviser working for a charity, heard about the allegations from a group of Syrian women in a refugee camp in Jordan in March 2015. She conducted a focus group with some of these women who told her how men from local councils in areas such as Dara'a and Quneitra had offered them aid for sex. \"They were withholding aid that had been delivered and then using these women for sex,\" Ms Spencer said. \"Some had experienced it themselves, some were very distraught. \"I remember one woman crying in the room and she was very upset about what she had experienced. Women and girls need to be protected when they are trying to receive food and soap and basic items to live. The last thing you need is a man who you're supposed to trust and supposed to be receiving aid from, then asking you to have sex with him and withholding aid from you.\" She continued: \"It was so endemic that they couldn't actually go without being stigmatised. It was assumed that if you go to these distributions, that you will have performed some kind of sexual act in return for aid.\" A few months later, in June 2015, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) surveyed 190 women and girls in Dara'a and Quneitra. Its report suggested about 40% had said sexual violence took place when they were accessing services, including humanitarian aid. An IRC spokesman said: \"The assessment concluded that sexual violence was a widespread concern, including when seeking access to various types of services across southern Syria. These services included the distribution of humanitarian aid.\" The reports - both of which have been seen by the BBC - were presented at a meeting of UN agencies and international charities hosted by the UNPFA in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 15 July 2015. As a result of this meeting, some aid agencies tightened up their procedures. The IRC said: \"Within our own operations, we launched new programmes and systems to better protect women and girls in southern Syria. Those programmes continue to be funded by a range of donors, including DfID (the UK's Department for International Development).\" Abuse 'ignored for years' The charity Care expanded its monitoring team in Syria, set up a complaints mechanism and no longer hands over aid to local councils. It also asked various UN agencies, including the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to investigate further and set up new reporting mechanisms. But Care was refused permission to carry out studies in Jordanian refugee camps. Ms Spencer claims the aid sector turned a blind eye to ensure that aid still got into southern Syria. \"Sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls has been ignored, it's been known about and ignored for seven years,\" she said. \"The UN and the system as it currently stands have chosen for women's bodies to be sacrificed. \"Somewhere there has been a decision made that it is OK for women's bodies to continue to be used, abused, violated in order for aid to be delivered for a larger group of people.\" Another source who attended the July 2015 meeting on behalf of one of the UN agencies told the BBC: \"There were credible reports of sexual exploitation and abuse going on during the cross-border aid delivery and the UN didn't make any serious moves to address it or end it.\" A spokesman for UNFPA said it had heard of possible cases of exploitation and abuse of Syrian women in southern Syria from Care. It said it had not received any allegations of abuse or exploitation from the two NGOs it works with in southern Syria. The spokesman also made clear that UNFPA does not work with local councils as implementing partners. A spokesman for the children's charity Unicef confirmed it was present at the July 2015 meeting. The charity said it carried out a review of its local partners and contractors in southern Syria and is not aware of any allegations against them at this point. But it accepted that sexual exploitation was a serious risk in Syria and said it was introducing a community-based complaints mechanism and more training for its partners. A DfID spokesman said it was not aware of any cases like this involving UK aid. \"There are mechanisms already in place to raise issues of abuse and exploitation,\" the department said. \"DfID partners in Syria use third party monitors to verify UK aid distributed in Syria.\" Zero tolerance The spokesman added that any systematic abuse should be picked up by those monitors and reported to DfID. An Oxfam spokeswoman said it had not been working with local councils delivering aid in the south of Syria in the run up to 2015 and was not doing so today. \"Our work inside Syria has been largely focused on providing large-scale hardware for supplying water to Syrian communities rather than targeting aid at individuals or specific households,\" she said. \"We did not receive reports about sexual exploitation around aid delivery in 2015, but have a zero tolerance policy on such abuse.\" A spokesman for the UNHCR, Andrej Mahecic, said it was \"important to understand that in any aid emergency there is a risk of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, and to abuse somebody who is in need of assistance is despicable\". He added that while the allegations relating to 2015 were \"incomplete, fragmented and unsubstantiated\" the UN nevertheless had taken some action when they first surfaced. He said the UN refugee agency had no access to the area of southern Syria where the abuse was alleged to have taken place, but that the agency did seek to bring local partners to Jordan for training. He continued: \"The mere suggestion that the UN can somehow control the situation in a war zone is rather simplistic and disconnected from the reality of what an aid operation looks like in an open and fierce conflict.\"", "summary": "Une enquête de la BBC révèle que des femmes ont été exploitées sexuellement en Syrie par des employés des agences de l'ONU et d'organisations caritatives internationales."}

Is there an equivalent International Men's Day? And what virtual events will take place this year? For more than a century people around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women. Read on to find out why. 1. How did it start? International Women's Day, also known as IWD for short, grew out of the labour movement to become a recognised annual event by the United Nations (UN). The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed on her suggestion unanimously. It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 110th International Women's Day. Things were made official in 1975 when the United Nations started celebrating the day. The first theme adopted by the UN (in 1996) was \"Celebrating the past, Planning for the Future\". International Women's Day has become a date to celebrate how far women have come in society, in politics and in economics, while the political roots of the day mean strikes and protests are organised to raise awareness of continued inequality. 2. When is IWD? It's on 8 March. Clara's idea for an International Women's Day had no fixed date. It wasn't formalised until a war-time strike in 1917 when Russian women demanded \"bread and peace\" - and four days into the women's strike the Tsar was forced to abdicate and the provisional government granted women the right to vote. The date when the women's strike commenced on the Julian calendar, which was then in use in Russia, was Sunday 23 February. This day in the Gregorian calendar was 8 March - and that's when it's celebrated today. 3. What colours symbolise International Women's Day? Purple, green and white are the colours of IWD according to the International Women's Day website. \"Purple signifies justice and dignity. Green symbolizes hope. White represents purity, albeit a controversial concept. The colours originated from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in the UK in 1908,\" they say. 4. Is there an International Men's Day? There is indeed, on 19 November. But it has only been marked since the 1990s and isn't recognised by the UN. People celebrate it in more than 80 countries worldwide, including the UK. The day celebrates \"the positive value men bring to the world, their families and communities\", highlighting positive role models and raising awareness of men's well-being. The theme for 2020 was \"Better health for men and boys\". 5. How is Women's Day celebrated and will there be virtual events this year? International Women's Day is a national holiday in many countries, including Russia where the sales of flowers doubles during the three or four days around 8 March. In China, many women are given a half-day off work on 8 March, as advised by the State Council, although many employers don't always pass the half-day on to their female employees. In Italy, International Women's Day, or la Festa della Donna, is celebrated by the giving of mimosa blossom. The origin of this tradition is unclear but it is believed to have started in Rome after World War Two. In the US, the month of March is Women's History Month. A presidential proclamation issued every year honours the achievements of American women. This year will look a little different because of coronavirus and more virtual events are expected to take place around the world, including this one from the UN. 6. What is the IWD 2021 theme? The UN announced their theme for 2021 as \"Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world\". UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said: \"We need women's representation that reflects all women and girls in all their diversity and abilities, and across all cultural, social, economic and political situations. This is the only way we will get real societal change that incorporates women in decision-making as equals and benefits us all.\" But there are also other themes around. The International Women's Day website - which it says it is designed to \"provide a platform to help forge positive change for women\" - has chosen the theme #ChooseToChallenge and says it is asking people to \"raise your hand high to show you're in and that you commit to choose to challenge and call out inequality\". 7. Why do we need it? \"Gender parity will not be attained for almost a century,\" according to the IWD campaign, referring to the World Economic Forum, it says \"none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and nor likely will many of our children\". It's also recently been a very tough time, with data from UN Women revealing the coronavirus pandemic could wipe out 25 years of increasing gender equality. Women are doing significantly more domestic chores and family care because of the pandemic, which in turn, can impact upon job and education opportunities. Despite concerns over coronavirus, marches took place around the world for IWD 2020. While the majority were peaceful, in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, police detained dozens of women's rights activists shortly after masked men reportedly attacked marchers. Activists say women's rights are deteriorating in the country. Across Pakistan, marches took place in several cities in the face of violent threats and legal petitions. And in Mexico about 80,000 people took to the streets to highlight the country's rising levels of violence against women. More than 60 people left injured. Although the rally began peacefully, police say some groups threw petrol bombs and officers responded with tear gas. In the past few years though, we have seen progress and the women's movement reach an unprecedented scale. This year saw the inauguration of Kamala Harris as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice president. In 2019 Finland elected a new coalition government headed by five women, abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland and a law that controlled how women acted and dressed in public in Sudan was repealed. And who can forget the impact of the #MeToo conversation, which began back in 2017 with a hashtag on social media, speaking out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault? It's now a growing global phenomenon, which continues to highlight unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour and has led to many high profile convictions. Update 5 March 2021: This article has been updated to include more information about the theme for IWD 2021. What is 100 Women?

Anyone who is symptom-free by day 12 is unlikely to get symptoms, but they may still be infectious carriers. The researchers advise people who could be infectious - whether they have symptoms or not - to self-isolate for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others.

With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact. Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state. Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a \"law-enforcement operation\" against a \"clique\" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order. This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not. 'The impact is huge' \"The war is already regional,\" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst. \"The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region.

Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed. There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis. There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants. Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports. \"If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,\" says regional analyst Mr Abdi. The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it \"will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa\". 'End of Ethiopia as a nation-state' Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government. Mr Abdi told the BBC that \"what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself\". But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example. \"Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,\" he told the BBC. \"His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.\" In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict. More on the Tigray crisis: Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked \"overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid\", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying. The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says. Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report. Last thing the region needs About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says. If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts. The UN adds that the threat \"of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation\" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries \"is high\". Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out. The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours.", "summary": "Les combats dans l'État du Tigré, dans le nord de l'Éthiopie, pourraient non seulement avoir des conséquences dramatiques pour l'avenir du pays, mais aussi affecter sérieusement ses voisins."}

It's after the government announced a second national lockdown, which means pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and places of worship will also be closing on 5 November. But what's the science behind shutting gyms? Are they riskier than shopping or going to a restaurant? And what will it mean for the mental health of gym users? What does the science tell us? \"It's very difficult to know for sure where people get their virus,\" according to Professor Jonathan Ball, who's a virologist at the University of Nottingham. He says gyms are closing because the government is trying to react to the high number of coronavirus cases. \"When you've got such huge numbers of cases in the community, particularly in people who are young and healthy, they may not experience any symptoms at all. \"There's always a risk that you might interact with someone who's infected [without either of you knowing] and that allows the virus to transmit.\" Gyms might not be as high risk as hospitals or care homes but Prof Ball tells Newsbeat: \"You do tend to exercise quite vigorously, that means that you can breathe rapidly and quite deeply. \"Therefore, we'd expect that you could potentially produce droplets or aerosols that could go on to infect other people.\" He also points out there are lots of areas of gyms that people touch, like handles and equipment, before touching their faces. There is a big \"but\" though. Prof Ball says a lot of that risk can be dramatically lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. \"From the data that I've seen from Public Health England, I'm not aware that there is a significant hotspot for infections in the gym environment. \"We know where the major risks are but after that we know there are other activities where people mix and where people mix, there is a chance of transmission occurring.\" Analysis by BBC Reality Check The only government data on gyms comes from Public Health England's surveillance report, which is based on data from Test and Trace. That data puts gyms on 2.8%, while supermarkets are 11.2%, pubs and bars are 7.4% and secondary schools are 6.8%. What those percentages mean is a bit tricky - here's where they come from. In the week to 25 October, 107,046 people who had tested positive for coronavirus were referred for contact tracing. Of those, 33,233 had been somewhere in the previous seven days that at least one other person contacted had visited. About 930 of those said they had been to the gym - that's 2.8% of all the common locations reported. We don't know if they caught it at the gym - we just know they visited the gym. Is that a lot? It's hard to tell - you need to take into account how many people visit a gym regularly compared with, for example, a supermarket. The point is that for the latest week, gyms came sixth on the list of common locations, ahead of people attending universities, people working in care homes and people going shopping for clothes. And the government is bound to have noticed that. Its scientific advisory group Sage estimated in September that closing indoor gyms and leisure centres could potentially reduce the R number (that's the average number of people each infected person infects) by 0.1, but stressed that estimating that was \"very difficult\". What do gym users say? Trainer Nathan Penman spoke to Newsbeat just before his gym closed in Liverpool in mid-October. Gyms in the Liverpool City Region closed earlier than the rets of the country, when the region went into tier three - the highest Covid alert level. \"It's just a bizarre feeling in the gym. It's the same kind of consensus among everybody there.\" As well as working in a gym, Nathan says exercising is hugely important for his physical and mental health. \"Health and fitness, physically and mentally should be a priority for the nation at the minute. \"So for the government to turn around and say that gyms are not important - I think it's giving off a ridiculous message.\" Nathan says people in the gyms he trains in have followed the rules. But 29-year-old Jack Occleshaw, from Nottingham, isn't as confident. \"You could tell that staff at the gym had put in all the measures to make you feel comfortable and were taking the situation seriously,\" he says. \"But it was more the actual members that were not keeping up.\" Jack was frustrated by members not wiping down equipment after use and thinks staff should have enforced the rules more strictly. \"I also tend to swim to help with mental health and clear my head. \"In our gym you have to book a slot. But you'd see people walk past the pool and say 'I reckon I could fit in there'.\" Jack's concerns about people not following advice meant he was put off from using the gym. But this is no longer a choice he, or other gym users, will have. What do gyms say? As you'd expect, gyms aren't happy about being forced to close, with Anytime Fitness among those calling on the government to review its decision. The chain says the announcement is \"difficult to take\" given people have been using gyms for the last four months. It adds that if the government goes ahead with plans to shut gyms and leisure centres, then \"comprehensive financial support will be needed.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Ms Oduala was one of the first to take to the streets after a video went viral of a man allegedly being killed by the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars), sparking what became known as the EndSars demonstrations. She set up camp outside the Lagos governor's office on 7 October, demanding the police unit be disbanded. As a media strategist, she knew how to rally people on social media to join her - organising blankets for people who ended up sleeping outside the state government buildings for 72 hours before police attacked them. With her 172,000 Twitter followers, she is one of several women who have shaken the Nigerian establishment to its core over the last six weeks. Her EndSars activism saw her Twitter account get the blue verified badge. Today she is part of a panel in Lagos sitting at a judicial inquiry into police abuse - one of the key demands of the protesters after the president disbanded the unit. But she is concerned about her security and is one of 20 protest organisers to have their funds frozen by the central bank early in November. \"It's disheartening that our good intention of ending police brutality would make us get tagged as terrorists,\" she told the BBC. The central bank says it sought a court order to block the accounts for 90 days in order to find out the source of their funds. Ms Oduala says her lawyers are challenging the order. 'This is just the beginning' Another female EndSars activist - lawyer Modupe Odele - had her passport confiscated last month. She had offered legal aid to those arrested during the demonstrations. And last week, the website of the Feminist Coalition - a group set up by around 10 women in July to fight for gender equality, which became active during the EndSars protests - was blocked inside Nigeria and it is not clear who was behind the move. During the protests the non-governmental organisation raised $385,000 (£290,000) through crowdfunding and spent part of the money on legal services for those protesters who were arrested, to pay medical bills for those wounded, to provide private security at protest points and daily refreshments. The group says the rest of the funds are to be used to provide support, including mental health counselling, for victims of police brutality and the families of those who died. It also hopes to sponsor a memorial for those killed by the police. \"This is just the beginning of a youth awakening in Nigeria, of things that we can do to improve the state of the country,\" Fakhrriyyah Hashim, a co-Founder of Feminist Coalition, told the BBC. \"We will continue to do this, especially in the lives of women,\" she said. Nigeria may be a very patriarchal society, but women have always been vocal in demanding change, most notably during the anti-colonial struggle. So the organising power of the women on the EndSars frontlines should not surprise the authorities. More on #EndSars protests: In 1929 the Aba women's riots - also referred to as the \"Women's War\" - were sparked by plans to tax southern market women. Over two months, thousands of women were involved in protests that saw colonial shops and banks attacked and courts burnt down. In the end the colonial administrators backed down. Eighteen years later, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, mother of the famous Afrobeat star Fela Kuti, successfully mobilised thousands of women against more proposed taxes to be levied on small traders. Dubbed the Lioness of Lisabi, she became a firm advocate for women's suffrage and an important figure in the fight for independence. The estimated 20,000 women who joined her Abeokuta Women's Union were known for their persistence, never giving up until achieving their aim. \"The history of Nigeria has had a lot of women come out to fight and push for their rights. Those battles strong women before us fought have been downplayed,\" said Ndi Kato, a gender activist who participated in the EndSars protests. EndSars' backbone No-one knows this more than Aisha Yesufu, co-founder of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, which has been working over the last six years to rescue the schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok by Islamist Boko Haram militants. She was among the EndSars protesters who were tear-gassed by police in the capital, Abuja. But she didn't run away from the fracas and her picture of defiance later became one of the symbols of the EndSars movement. Ms Yesufu says it is not surprising that women became the backbone of the EndSars protests. \"Women have always been the ones who get things done. Any protest that led to change has always been women-led,\" she told me. \"The EndSars protest went as far as it did because of the role women played. Especially the Feminist Coalition, those women were amazing. Their co-ordination was impressive.\" 'Unstoppable' Ms Kato says it is not the end of road: \"The fact that young people are re-strategising, going back to the drawing board and looking for several ways to get our voices to be heard does not mean that we have stopped protesting.\" Women have shown during EndSars how they can use both social media and offline strategies to get their voices heard - which Ms Yesufu says they should use to their advantage in the fight for gender equality. \"Women should look beyond feminism to femi-power. It's time to put ourselves to places we need to be. We have to stop asking to be invited to the table, we should create the table,\" she said. \"It's time for any woman that feels like going into politics to do so without looking back. We should not doubt ourselves. Let's take our place and be unapologetic about it.\" Ms Oduala agrees the fight will go on. \"The future for women looks bright because we all saw what we could do, so if women decide to do anything for themselves or their community they would be unstoppable.\"", "summary": "Rinu Oduala a 22 ans et ne cache pas ses sentiments : le gouvernement nigérian se sent tellement menacé par elle que son compte bancaire a été gelé."}

The organisation is urging governments to consider taxes on the super-rich. Oxfam's report comes as global leaders gather virtually for the World Economic Forum's \"Davos Dialogue\" meeting. In December 2020, the total wealth of billionaires worldwide hit $11.95tn - equivalent to the recovery spending of all the G20 governments put together, according to the charity. The 10 richest people, whose fortunes rose by $540bn since March 2020, include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Oxfam claims that the billionaires' fortunes rose due to rebounding stock markets and a \"rigged economy\", causing rising inequality during the \"worst economic downturn in a century\". Many tech giants saw sales - and share prices - rise in 2020, as lockdowns led to a jump in demand for digital services. This inflated the wealth of men like Mr Bezos, whose giant fortunes are driven by the value of holdings such as property and the shares they own, rather than wages. However, \"wealth\" does not equal income. Wealth estimates refer to the net worth of an individual, including their money, the value of their assets and also the \"notional\" value of the shares they hold. A rise in share prices pertains to the perceived net worth of a company as a whole, rather than the shareholders themselves. Living in poverty The report said that Mr Bezos's worth had climbed so much between March-September 2020 that he could have given all 876,000 Amazon employees a $105,000 bonus and still have been as wealthy as he was before the pandemic. This compares with the world's poorest, for whom economic recovery could take more than a decade. Oxfam estimates that between 200 million and 500 million more people were living in poverty in 2020, reversing the decline in global poverty seen over the last two decades. \"We think that this is... an opportunity to do something radical about building back fairer to think about wealth taxes, to think about corporation taxes, to think about increasing the basic social floor for every citizen,\" Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam's chief executive told the BBC. With reference to the UK, he said imposing a tax could raise millions. Aren't the world's wealthiest doing their bit? Yes - some are. There have been a relatively high number of charitable mega-donations since the pandemic began, with celebrities, sports stars and business leaders responding to the Covid-19 emergency. In an October report, UBS said 209 billionaires had committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020 to fight Covid-19. \"They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds,\" the report added. Last month, MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, revealed she had donated more than $4bn to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. As of June last year, Mr Bezos was said to have donated $125m to the coronavirus effort. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Harry Potter author JK Rowling has donated £1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, says it has committed a total of $1.75bn to the global Covid-19 response, including for the development and delivery of vaccines and tests. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is also the third-largest donor to the World Health Organization.", "summary": "Pendant la pandémie de coronavirus, la richesse combinée des dix hommes les plus riches du monde a augmenté de 540 milliards de dollars (291 206 milliards de Fcfa), constate Oxfam."}

Women must sit separately from single men in these places. They are not allowed to carry out most activities without being accompanied by their male guardians, usually a father or husband, but possibly a brother or a son.

In particular, people pointed out the discrepancies between the arrest and the country's recent progression in women's rights, where women were given the right to drive in May. Television presenter Osama Gaweesh said he was confused with the arrest, asking: \"Doesn't [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman want a new, open Saudi Arabia with concerts and movie theatres and beaches and a 2030 vision?\" While another Egyptian user, Sonia, called it a result of \"fragile egos\" amongst Saudi men.", "summary": "Un travailleur du secteur de l'hôtellerie d'origine égyptienne a été arrêté en Arabie Saoudite après avoir partagé un repas avec une collègue saoudienne intégralement voilée."}

Mr Mutharika, who wants a second term, was up against Lazarus Chakwera, who heads an opposition coalition. Evidence of vote tampering led to judges scrapping his May 2019 victory. The country's judiciary has been widely praised for its robust response. Malawi became the second African nation to annul a presidential election over irregularities, after Kenya in 2017. The country had been bitterly divided in the run-up to Tuesday's re-run, the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza reports. Widespread anti-government protests and violence threatened to plunge Malawi into an even deeper crisis. Speaking after he had voted in southern Malawi, Mr Mutharika alleged there had been violence in some opposition strongholds, the Reuters news agency reports. \"It is very sad. Our secretary general has been beaten up. Those causing the violence are desperate,\" it quotes the president as saying. \"How then will the election be credible?\" he asked. There has been no verification of these reports. On casting his vote in the capital, Mr Chakwera said that he had \"confidence in the electoral commission to do what is right\". \"I believe that Malawians' quest for justice is actually being answered today. And I believe their rights will be respected,\" he added. Speaking on the eve of the vote, the head of the electoral commission, Chifundo Kachale, told BBC Focus on Africa that he was confident that everything was ready despite the election date only being set a few weeks ago. Whoever wins the election, will have to heal these deep divisions as well as tackle key electoral issues such as corruption, poverty and unemployment. Why was there a new vote? A re-run of the May 2019 election was ordered by Malawi's Constitutional Court in February after judges found widespread irregularities with the original ballot. That election saw President Mutharika narrowly re-elected by less than 159,000 votes with a 38.6% share of the vote. Mr Chakwera came second with 35.4%. Mr Chakwera and the candidate who came third argued that the election had not been fair. Their complaints included allegations that vote tallying forms had been added up incorrectly and tampered with using correction fluid - known in Malawi by its brand name Tipp-Ex.

February's decision to annul the election led some to celebrate, but Mr Mutharika described it as a \"serious subversion of justice\" which marked the death of the country's democracy. Last month, Malawi's former electoral commission chair Jane Ansah resigned following months of pressure by protesters who criticised her handling of the poll. The new vote comes at a time of growing tension between the government and the country's courts. There have also been concerns over the logistics and safety of carrying out an election in the midst of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Who was in the race? The president and his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are in an alliance with another party, the United Democratic Front (UDF).

Mr Mutharika, a former law professor who taught in the US before becoming a cabinet minister, was first elected to Malawi's top office in 2014. Two years earlier his brother, Bingu wa Mutharika, died while serving as president. He faces competition from Mr Chakwera, a former cleric who heads up the opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP).

Mr Chilima - who finished third in the 2019 vote - was once an ally of President Mutharika, but has since fallen out with him.

And Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she would not attend a meeting of high-level Olympic officials in protest. According to local media, almost 400 people have also withdrawn applications to volunteer at the Olympic games, which are scheduled for later this year. The committee board currently has 24 members, five of whom are women. In 2019, the committee - which is responsible for selecting Japanese Olympians - set itself a goal of increasing the number of female board directors to 40%. \"If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying. \"We have about seven women at the organising committee, but everyone understands their place.\" Mr Mori is known in the country for a string of gaffes and undiplomatic statements made while in office from 2000 to 2001. He told Japan's Mainichi newspaper that female family members had also lambasted him after his comments. \"Last night, my wife gave me a thorough scolding. She said: 'You've said something bad again, haven't you? I'm going to have to suffer again because you've antagonised women',\" he said. \"This morning, my daughter and granddaughter scolded me as well,\" the paper quoted him as saying.

The small fragment of 5,000-year-old wood - which is now in several pieces - is said to be \"hugely significant\". The engineer Waynman Dixon originally discovered it among items inside the pyramid's Queens Chamber in 1872. The piece of cedar - which it is believed may have been used during the pyramid's construction - was donated to the university in 1946 but then could not be located. Curatorial assistant Abeer Eladany found it while conducting a review of items housed in the university's Asia collection. Abeer, who is originally from Egypt and spent 10 years working in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, cross-referenced it with other records. 'Hidden in plain sight' \"Once I looked into the numbers in our Egypt records I instantly knew what it was, and that it had effectively been hidden in plain sight in the wrong collection,\" she said. \"I'm an archaeologist and have worked on digs in Egypt but I never imagined it would be here in north-east Scotland that I'd find something so important to the heritage of my own country. \"It may be just a small fragment of wood, which is now in several pieces, but it is hugely significant given that it is one of only three items ever to be recovered from inside the Great Pyramid.\" Two other items found by Waynman Dixon - a ball and hook - are now housed in the British Museum, but the wood was missing. \"The university's collections are vast - running to hundreds of thousands of items - so looking for it has been like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Abeer added. \"I couldn't believe it when I realised what was inside this innocuous-looking cigar tin.\" Covid restrictions delayed the dating of the rediscovered cedar fragment. Results have recently been returned and show that the wood can be dated to somewhere in the period 3341-3094 BC. 'Quite a revelation' This is said to support the theory that, whatever their use, the so-called Dixon Relics were original to the construction of the Great Pyramid and not later artefacts left behind by those exploring the chambers. But the dating is also surprising as historical records have dated the pyramid itself to a period about 500 years later. Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections at the University of Aberdeen, said: \"Finding the missing Dixon Relic was a surprise but the carbon dating has also been quite a revelation. It is even older than we had imagined. \"This may be because the date relates to the age of the wood, maybe from the centre of a long-lived tree. Alternatively, it could be because of the rarity of trees in ancient Egypt, which meant that wood was scarce, treasured and recycled or cared for over many years.\" He added: \"It will now be for scholars to debate its use and whether it was deliberately deposited, as happened later during the New Kingdom, when pharaohs tried to emphasise continuity with the past by having antiquities buried with them. \"This discovery will certainly reignite interest in the Dixon Relics and how they can shed light on the Great Pyramid.\" You might be interested in:", "summary": "Un objet égyptien perdu depuis longtemps a été retrouvé dans une boîte à cigares à Aberdeen, en Écosse - il pourrait jeter une nouvelle lumière sur la Grande Pyramide."}

She was arrested in May after publishing videos on TikTok and Instagram where she lip-synced to famous songs and danced in fashionable clothes. The prosecutor found her videos indecent. Mawada has more than three million followers on TikTok, and 1.6 million on Instagram. \"She only wanted to be famous and popular,\" laments Rahma. 'The TikTok girls' Mawada is one of five young women who were given the same prison sentence, in addition to a fine of nearly $20,000 (£15,300; 17,000 euros). The five are known as the \"TikTok girls\". Aside from Mawada, the group includes another social media star, Haneen Hossam, and three others who have not been named. Rahma says her sister was modelling on social media for a number of well-known fashion brands. \"She was just too ambitious. She dreamt of being an actress. \"Why her? Some actresses dress in a very explicit way. Nobody touches them,\" she asks angrily. According to human rights group Amnesty International, prosecutors used 17 photos of Mawada against her as evidence of \"indecency\". Mawada said these images had been leaked from her phone after it was stolen last year. Mawada and the other four women began an appeal against their convictions on Monday, and the next hearing is scheduled for 14 September. At the very least, Rahma hopes her sister's sentence will be reduced. Mawada fainted when she heard the initial verdict, according to her lawyer, Ahmed Bahkiry. \"She's totally devastated - the charges are very vaguely worded.\" \"Prison cannot be a solution, even if some of her videos go against our social norms and traditions,\" he adds. \"Prisons create criminals. The authorities could have resorted to rehabilitation instead.\" There are mixed feelings in Egypt towards the case. Some in this largely Muslim, conservative country view TikTok videos such as Mawada's as indecent. Others say the girls were only having fun and do not deserve prison. Human rights groups see the girls' arrests as a further attempt by the authorities to restrict freedom of expression and as a sign of what Amnesty called \"new repressive tactics to control cyberspace\". There are, campaigners say, tens of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt, including liberals, Islamists, journalists and human rights lawyers. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi insists there are no prisoners of conscience in his country, while the state has questioned the credibility of critical human rights reports. 'Reckless and licentious' Among those calling for the girls' release is the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a Cairo-based human rights organisation. Its executive director, Mohamed Lotfy, says the case shows clear signs of gender discrimination. \"Women are only allowed to express themselves on social media according to the state's dictations,\" he says. \"The girls are accused of breaching Egyptian family values, but no-one has ever defined these values.\" Even if they were to be released, Mr Lotfy says a warning has already been sent to young girls. \"The authorities have made it clear: you are not free to say or do whatever you like, even if you are not talking politics at all. There are lines which are not to be crossed.\" In recent months, the public prosecutor's office issued statements highlighting what it called the \"potential dangers threatening our youth via digital platforms, which are not subject to any sort of supervision\". It called on parents to help stop young people being \"misled into adopting a reckless and licentious lifestyle, in search of worthless fame and success\". \"They pursued illegal paths to make money, falsely believing this is a form of freedom of speech,\" it said. Meanwhile, as a result of what has happened, Rahma says their mother \"barely leaves her bed now\". \"She cries all the time,\" she says. \"Sometimes she wakes up at night and asks if Mawada is back home.\" You may also be interested in:", "summary": "\"Nous avons été laissées en état de choc.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' spokesman said the resolution was a \"big blow to Israeli policy\". The resolution was passed after the US refused to veto it, breaking with long-standing American practice. Washington has traditionally sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. The Egyptian-drafted resolution had been withdrawn after Israel asked US President-elect Donald Trump to intervene, but it was proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela.. The resolution, approved by 14 votes to zero, with only the US abstaining, demands that Israel immediately \"cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem\". It says Jewish settlements are a \"flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\". The issue is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians. About 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay Israeli reaction: 'Gang-up at the UN' A statement issued by Mr Netanyahu's office said: \"Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms. \"At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half-a-million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall 'occupied territory'. \"The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes\". Mr Netanyahu is looking forward to working with Mr Trump, the statement added. Israel also announced its ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal had been ordered to return for consultations and that it was cutting all aid programmes to Senegal. Israel has no diplomatic ties with Malaysia and Venezuela. What did the Palestinians say? A spokesman for Mr Abbas said: \"The Security Council resolution is a big blow to Israeli policy, a unanimous international condemnation of settlements and a strong support for the two-state solution.\" The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour said: \"The Council's action, while long overdue, is timely, necessary and important.\" The US reaction The US envoy to the UN, Samantha Power, said the resolution reflected the \"facts on the ground\" that settlement growth had been accelerating. \"The settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is threatening the two-state solution,\" she said. Criticising Mr Netanyahu, she said: \"One cannot simultaneously champion expanding settlements and champion a two-state solution that would end the conflict.\" However, she said the US had not voted in favour of the resolution because it was \"too narrowly focused\" on settlements. She added that even if all settlements were dismantled, both sides would still have to acknowledge \"uncomfortable truths\" and make \"difficult choices\" to reach peace. Meanwhile, Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, tweeted after the vote: \"As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" On Thursday, Mr Trump had urged the council to reject the motion. \"Peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" he said. US policy reverse: By BBC's Barbara Plett Usher The resolution reflects an international consensus that the growth of Israeli settlement-building has come to threaten the viability of a Palestinian state in any future peace deal. It is a view strongly shared by the Obama administration, and for that reason the US reversed its policy of vetoing any UN Security Council criticism of Israel. It is a decision that was taken after months of debate within the administration about whether and how President Obama might be able to define his position on a two-state solution before leaving office. But his successor Donald Trump has made clear he intends to strongly support Israeli government positions, even making a highly unorthodox intervention before the vote by publicly urging Mr Obama to veto the resolution.", "summary": "Le Premier ministre israélien, Benjamin Netanyahu, a déclaré que l'appel de l'ONU pour mettre fin aux activités de colonisation sur les terres occupées en Palestine est \"honteux\"."}

According to social networking site LinkedIn, Celestine Omin, 28, landed in New York's JFK airport last Sunday after a 24-hour flight from Nigeria. Mr Omin is employed by Andela, a tech start-up with offices in New York, Lagos, Nairobi and San Francisco. The firm says it recruits \"the most talented developers on the African continent\" and connects them with tech employers in the US for potential job vacancies. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg visited Andela's office in Lagos last year. Mr Omin had reportedly been granted a short-term visa to work with First Access, a financial technology company in New York's Manhattan district. After being asked a series of questions by a US Customs and Border Protection officer, he was taken into a room for further checks. \"Your visa says you are a software engineer. Is that correct?\" an officer is reported to have asked Mr Omin. He says he was then given a piece of paper and a pen and told to answer these two questions to prove he is actually a software engineer: \"Write a function to check if a Binary Search Tree is balanced.\" \"What is an abstract class, and why do you need it?\" Mr Omin told LinkedIn it seemed to him the questions had been \"Googled\" by \"someone with no technical background\". He said later on Twitter that he was \"too tired to even think\", and told the officer they could \"talk about other computer science concepts\". After he handed back his answers, he was told by the officer that they were wrong. He said he presumed he was required to provide \"the Wikipedia definition\" for the questions. However, he was even more surprised a little later when the officer told him he was \"free to go\". \"Look, I am going to let you go, but you don't look convincing to me,\" said the officer, according to Mr Omin. \"I didn't say anything back. I just walked out.\" He later found out that border protection officers had phoned Andela to verify his story. A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told the BBC: \"US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers strive to treat all people arriving in the country with dignity and respect. \"While we are not at liberty to discuss individual cases due to the Privacy Act, our CBP officers enforce not only immigration and customs laws, but also more than 400 laws for 40 other agencies and have stopped thousands of violators of US law.\" Nigeria is not one of the seven countries included in US President Donald Trump's temporary immigration pause. However, the African country has been struggling with the threat of terrorism in recent times, in particular from the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. Mr Trump has repeatedly called for \"strong borders\" and \"extreme vetting\" since taking office on 20 January. Filipinos oppose proposed death penalty Filipinos are voicing opposition to the proposed reintroduction of the death penalty by using the hashtag #NoToDeathPenalty. Today, lawmakers passed a second reading for bill, though it will still need to go through further stages before becoming law. But social media users are critical of the reintroduction of the penalty even though this time round it would only be applied to drug-related offences. The largely devout Catholic country last abolished capital punishment in 2006. It was the first Asian country to do so in 1987, though the law was later reinstated in 1993. Students were among those who expressed their reservations to the move on Twitter and Facebook. One said: \"I am RJ Naguit from University of Santo Tomas and I am against any measure that desecrates the value of human life.\" \"I am Jesica Canete, 23-years-old from Looc, Lapu-Lapu City. I believe that all lives matter. I am against the death penalty,\" another added. A Filipino philosophy student pointed out what he said was the \"irony\" of the House of Representatives possibly reviving the death penalty on \"a day of mercy and compassion\", Ash Wednesday. \"I'm a registered voter and I don't recognise the power of the state over the life or death of any individual,\" another user said. Raymond Badri, who works for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines said the death penalty was simply the \"legal name for murder\". \"I am against the reimposition of the death penalty. This is not the way to go,\" Jesuit priest and President of Ateneo de Davao University Joel Tabora added. Last weekend, more than 1,000 people protested in the Philippine capital Manila against President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal anti-drugs crackdown which was launched in July and in which more than 7,000 people are said to have been killed. A day before the anti-Duterte protest, Senator Leila de Lima one of the most vocal critics of the president's anti-drugs crackdown - was arrested on drug charges that she denies. The president has said in the past that he would be \"happy to slaughter\" the country's drug addicts. In December 2016, he told the BBC that he killed three men when he was Mayor of Davao. The latest move to reintroduce the penalty has been criticised by human rights groups and diplomats who say it would breach the country's legal international obligations. Thousands were also said to have marched against the proposal in the capital earlier this month. But the president still enjoys a high level of approval in the country. Last Saturday, his backers also rallied in Manila to support his anti-drugs campaign.

Here's how. Travelling to and from distant places by road in Kenya, is not something many people look forward to. The biggest challenge is to arrive alive at your destination. Over 3,400 people died on Kenyan roads last year, an increase of 13% from 2018. The main causes are speeding, drunk driving and fatigue. If you avoid death or serious injury, you still may not escape the discomfort of the terrible roads. Although there's been a lot of improvement of Kenya's infrastructure in recent years, some of the roads are in poor shape and become unusable during rainy season. As a former British colony, we drive on the left in Kenya, but people are often forced to drive on whatever's left of the roads due to the numerous potholes which scar many roads, including the central business district of the capital Nairobi. However, there's another reason that makes long-distance road travel a nightmare - toilets. When you're squashed in a packed bus, and the call of nature comes, you're in deep trouble. That's because when the authorities built these highways, they did not include public toilets along the way. So, in these instances, drivers stop in the middle of nowhere, and as soon as the door is opened, people dash in different directions, in search of the nearest bush to relieve themselves. It makes for a disturbing picture of men, women and children forced into a communal squat position. All shame is lost as the multitude that was in a bus focuses on one grave priority - emptying bladders and bowels. 'Unfortunate meal' Some students I mentor from a college in the coastal region of Mombasa told me how they recently went on a trip to central Kenya, a distance of about 700km (435 miles). Before leaving Mombasa, they had a meal, which unfortunately upset their stomachs. \"With no toilets along the way, our bus driver was forced to make several stops near bushes and forests for us to attend to the upheavals in our tummies,\" explained one of the students. \"It was the most uncomfortable 10-hour journey I'd ever had\". But now help has come through the actions of one man who went to court to compel the government to bring an end to this kind of suffering. Adrian Kamotho Njenga sued four public entities arguing they had breached the constitution by failing to provide free toilet facilities along public highways. The four bodies - the Council of Governors, which brings together the governors of all 47 counties, the Kenya National Highways Authority, the Kenya Rural Roads Authority and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority - all rejected the accusation and turned to a blame game. You may also be interested in: Some said Mr Njenga had not shown details of how exactly they had violated the constitution regarding public toilets. Others argued that they do not have a constitutional mandate to provide sanitation services. But like an impatient man pressed by the call of nature, Mr Njenga continued to push for a solution from the court. He argued that as a result of the failures of the public entities, road users on public highways had no way of disposing of human waste flowing from human biological functions, and end up relieving themselves in bushes and on the roadside, which is inhuman and degrading. No toilets = torture He even quoted from the Bible's fifth book, Deuteronomy, in which Moses commands the Israelites who were travelling to the promised land, to designate a place outside their camp where they could go to relieve themselves. And just in case the court was not persuaded to rely on the Bible as an authority in determining a constitutional matter, Mr Njenga explained the lack of toilets was subjecting commuters to suffer \"immense biological, metabolical and physiological torture, when faced with a call of nature while travelling on Kenyan roads\". Now these are words I don't think about when answering the call of nature, myself. But they sound quite serious, and in the end the judge agreed with Mr Njenga, and instructed the authorities concerned to create and implement a policy for the provision of toilets and other sanitation facilities along the Kenyan road network. So, we're all looking forward to the day when as commuters, we'll stop hopping about in the bushes to avoid stepping on human mess in the search for a clear spot, to bring relief to our bodies. For now, in the absence of the \"constitutional\" toilets, the beautiful wildlife that can be seen near the roads from Nairobi to Kisumu in the west, or to Mombasa at the coast, will continue to witness some ugly scenes as humans invade their space to dispose of their waste.

Many in Africa, and elsewhere, say the time has come for the return of cultural treasures looted during colonialism. The Benin Bronzes - thousands of brass, bronze and ivory sculptures and carvings - have become highly charged symbols of injustice. They are originally from what is now Edo State, in southern Nigeria. Stolen by British soldiers and sailors in 1897, most are in Western museums and private collections. The British Museum, which has some 950 Benin Bronzes, has come under particular criticism for its refusal to give them back, but is only one of many museums struggling to justify the legitimacy of its collection. The Edo kings - the obas- campaigned for decades in vain for the Benin Bronzes to be returned. But few in the West took seriously African demands for restitution. Western curators argued that Africa lacked the resources to look after its treasures, but also that Western museums had no moral obligation to repair any damage inflicted during decades of colonialism. That has now changed, and behind the scenes, things have been moving. Since 2017, the Benin Dialogue Group, which brings together the current oba, the Edo state governor, the Nigerian government and museums in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (including the British Museum) - has been working on a compromise plan for some Benin Bronzes to return to Nigeria. They have agreed that Benin City, the capital of Edo state, will host a new Benin Royal Museum. European museums will take turns to lend (although some may donate) a few hundred Benin Bronzes. The effect, says the Oba's Palace, will be a \"permanent collection in rotation\" in Benin City. At long last, the Edo people will be reunited with a significant part of their cultural patrimony.

He hired the Anglo-Ghanaian architect, Sir David Adjaye, designer of the acclaimed National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. Sir David's profile and vision - he wants the new museum to be \"the jewel in the ring\" of a wider cultural reinvigoration of Benin City - has impressed European curators. Phillip Iheanacho, an old friend to both Mr Obaseki and Sir David, is in charge of fundraising. He too has wooed the Europeans. It seems the stars have aligned. A committed Nigerian governor has attracted a famous architect and credible fundraiser, and the Europeans are onboard. Both sides back the museum All of which begs the question; what happens if Mr Obaseki, who is seeking another four-year term in state elections on 19 September, loses to his main challenger Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu? \"If Godwin is not re-elected, it would be very difficult indeed to continue with a project like this,\" Phillip Iheanacho told me. And with Mr Obaseki and Mr Iheanacho gone, it's hard to imagine Sir David hanging around. Of course, none of the European museums would presume to know who would make the best governor of Edo state, let alone tell people there whom to vote for. But, privately, they are worried about the prospect of restarting negotiations with a different governor. The director of one museum in the Benin Dialogue Group told me: \"It's been an Obaseki project - he's been a great partner. If it's somebody else, it's concerning, we could lose momentum.\" Another key curator said: \"This project requires money, capacity and bringing it together is complex. If the governor changes it will slow everything down enormously.\" I asked Mr Obaseki's opponent, Pastor Ize-Iyamu, what would happen to the Royal Museum if he became governor. He said the museum was a \"welcome development\". \"We intend to partner with the oba to establish a befitting museum that will showcase the rich cultural heritage of our people.\" It's true that even before the Covid-19 pandemic the Royal Museum project was running behind schedule. And whoever is governor, the Oba, Ewuare II - great-great-grandson of the king deposed by the British - will remain committed to it, and the principle that the Benin Bronzes should come home. But it is also true that Nigeria's cities are littered with white elephants, prestige projects started by an incumbent politician which did not attract sufficient interest from their successor. The JK Randle Centre in Lagos is a huge and delayed cultural project that was the passion of a previous governor. The British Museum agreed to lend it several items. But its future is in the balance; officially due to open in mid-2021, I'm told the project is now looking precarious. Artefacts 'now an embarrassment' So what does all this say about the restitution cause? There are many, in Nigeria and beyond, who see this as a matter of principle. The Benin Bronzes were stolen. It is offensive, they say, to make their return conditional on the construction of a museum, or the machinations of Nigerian politics, just as it is offensive to talk about loans, not permanent returns. But there is another way of looking at it. The European museums, I believe, are desperate to fend off the withering criticism of recent years. They need the Royal Museum to succeed. A Nigerian negotiator told me how some Europeans within the Benin Dialogue Group feel their Benin Bronzes \"have become an embarrassment\". \"Quite frankly, if Obaseki set up a shed at the back of his house, they'd hand them over to him. Just to be rid of them.\" In other words, the power dynamic has shifted. The opening of a museum in Benin City, full of magnificent Benin Bronzes returned from Europe, would be one of the most significant moments in African cultural history since independence. Tantalisingly, it is within touching distance. But it is the actions of Nigerian politicians which will determine whether it happens. And that, in itself, reflects how the world has changed.

However, global confirmed executions decreased for the fourth consecutive year to 657 - 5% less than in 2018. It was the lowest recorded figure of the past decade, according to Amnesty. The human rights group's tally does not include China, where the number of executions - believed to be in the thousands - remains a state secret. It also notes that other countries, including Iran, North Korea and Vietnam, hide the full extent of their use of the death penalty by restricting access to information. \"The death penalty is an abhorrent and inhuman punishment; and there is no credible evidence that it deters crime more than prisons terms. A large majority of countries recognize this and it's encouraging to see that executions continue to fall worldwide,\" said Clare Algar, Amnesty's senior director for research. \"However, a small number of countries defied the global trend away from the death penalty by increasingly resorting to executions.\" Saudi Arabia's growing use of the death penalty was an \"alarming development\", she added. The kingdom executed 178 men and six women in 2019, just over half of whom were foreign nationals. The total was 149 in 2018. The majority were convicted of drug-related offences and murder. But Amnesty documented what it called the \"increased use of the death penalty as a political weapon against dissidents from the Shia Muslim minority\". In April 2019, there was a mass execution of 37 people. All but five were Shia men convicted on \"terrorism\" charges after trials that Amnesty said relied on confessions extracted through torture. Ms Algar also said the large jump in executions in Iraq - from at least 52 in 2018 to at least 100 in 2019 - was \"shocking\". The rise was largely due to the continued use of the death penalty against individuals accused of being members of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). In South Sudan, the authorities executed at least 11 people last year - the highest number recorded since the country's independence in 2011. Yemen executed at least seven people in 2019, compared to at least four in 2018. Bahrain and Bangladesh also resumed executions after one-year hiatuses. Amnesty said several factors were mainly responsible for the global drop in recorded executions. There were significant reductions in the number of confirmed executions in countries - such as Egypt, Japan and Singapore - that are strong adherents of the death penalty. And for the second consecutive year, Iran executed fewer people than it had historically done, following amendments to its anti-narcotics law in 2017. No executions were carried out in Afghanistan for the first time since 2010. There were also hiatuses in Taiwan and Thailand, both of which executed people in 2018. Worldwide, 106 countries have abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes and 142 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.", "summary": "L'Arabie saoudite a mis à mort 184 personnes en 2019 - un nombre record pour le royaume - malgré une baisse des exécutions dans le monde, selon Amnesty International."}

But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content. Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study. However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger \"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. \"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained. If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts. How did we make the calculator? How is the environmental impact calculated? University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. What about serving sizes? The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA. The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. What are greenhouse gases? The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. How do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven? The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile. Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator. The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.", "summary": "Selon de récentes études scientifiques, éviter les produits carnés et les produits laitiers est l'un des moyens les plus efficaces de réduire votre impact sur l'environnement."}

The government was given 14 days to overhaul the regulations. South Africa initially had some of the world's most restrictive lockdown measures. The country has 35,812 confirmed cases and 755 deaths. The case was filed by the Liberty Fighters Network and the Hola Bona Renaissance Foundation. What did the judge say? The high court in the capital, Pretoria, ruled that the regulations were not connected to slowing the rate of infection or limiting its spread. \"The regulations... in a substantial number of instances are not rationally connected to the objectives of slowing the rate of infection or limiting the spread thereof,\" the written judgement read. Judge Norman Davis argued it was wrong to allow people to travel to attend funerals but not to earn their livelihoods by street trading, as many South Africans do. The government said it will review the regulations but in the meantime the current lockdown regulations will apply. Police have opened almost 230,000 cases for violating lockdown regulations since the beginning of lockdown on 26 March, according to the Police Minister Bheki Cele. Contraventions have included breaches of the ban on alcohol and cigarette trade, failure to stay at home and gathering illegally. On Wednesday Health Minister Zweli Mkhize warned on state TV that coronavirus was a bigger threat now than at the start of the lockdown, and he called on people to remain vigilant as cases continue to rise. What are the implcations of the ruling? By Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg The South African government has been criticised over some its lockdown regulations, many describing them as bizarre and arbitrary because it banned things like the sale of cooked food, tobacco products, alcohol and even prescribed what items of clothing people were allowed to buy. At one point during level four of the lockdown, short-sleeved T-shirts became contraband as retailers were not allowed to sell them. This ruling has serious implications about those who were imprisoned or fined for not complying with lockdown regulations. Will the fines stay in place or will they be overturned by the courts? While all of this plays out, South Africa is gearing up for confusion or even people outright ignoring lockdown rules - some local media are not making it clear that the government has two weeks to rectify the regulations. There is also a possibility that the government will appeal against the court ruling. Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Alliance is also taking the government to the constitutional court, arguing that the Disaster Management Act legislation which governs South Africa's lockdown be ruled unconstitutional. South Africa has eased its lockdown restrictions and this week alcohol sales resumed following a two-month ban - but only for home consumption. But all sales of cigarettes remain outlawed. Gatherings, except for work, religious ceremonies and funerals, are still banned. Travel between provinces is also prohibited, and international flights are cancelled except for those repatriating citizens.", "summary": "Un tribunal sud-africain a jugé \"inconstitutionnelles et invalides\" certaines réglementations de confinement pour lutter contre le coronavirus imposées par le gouvernement."}

But the billionaires' combined worth is down from $9.1 trillion at $8.7tn. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's wealth is among those falling. It has dropped by $8.7bn (£6.6bn) in the past year to $62.3bn, according to the Forbes list. His shares in Facebook at one point lost a third of their value as the company battled privacy scandals. Amazon's share price has been good for Mr Bezos' bank balance and the gap between him and the number two, Bill Gates, is a little wider, even though Mr Gates' fortune has swelled to $96.5bn from $90bn last year.

Luisa Kroll, assistant managing editor of wealth at Forbes, said: \"Even with strong headwinds, resourceful and relentless entrepreneurs find new ways to get rich.\" There are 52 UK citizens on the list.

Nigeria's Health Minister Dr Osagie Ehanire says the situation is being \"monitored closely\". But following preliminary investigations the state authorities have dismissed a connection with coronavirus. Hundreds of people are rumoured to have died in the community but no official death records are kept. Grave diggers initially raised concerns that they were burying a higher than usual number of bodies. Ali, a grave digger at the Abattoir Graveyard, told the BBC: \"We have never seen this, since the major cholera outbreak that our parents tell us about. That was about 60 years ago.\" This week, the state governor issued a statement saying the \"mysterious deaths\" were unrelated to coronavirus. But after ordering a \"thorough investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the deaths\", announced that their preliminary findings \"indicated that the deaths are not connected to the Covid-19 pandemic\". The state government said \"reports from the state ministry of health has shown that most of the deaths were caused by complications arising from hypertension, diabetes, meningitis and acute malaria\". \"Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is earnestly waiting for the final report from the state ministry of health so as to take the necessary action.\" The commercial and industrial centre of the north, Kano has become the epicentre of coronavirus in northern Nigeria. Its highly dense population is still in lockdown in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Don't tests show the cause of death? State officials started testing for Covid-19 two weeks ago and one lab has had to close due to contamination. Samples are being sent to the capital, Abuja, which authorities say is causing a delay in announcing how many positive cases have been detected in the state. Dr Sani Aliyu, who is the national co-ordinator for the presidential task force on Covid-19, says a team of five medical experts were deployed to Kano to facilitate in reopening the testing centre this week after it was fumigated. Officials also plan to open a second lab, at Bayero University, for testing for Covid-19 from next week. How many people have died? It is unclear how many people have died, as the deaths causing concern are happening in the community. Deaths in many parts of Nigeria are not registered, and so for those who died outside of hospital, no records are kept. This makes it difficult to understand how many people have died in recent weeks. Sabitu Shaibu, the deputy head of the state task force on Covid-19, is hoping to release preliminary findings of the investigation by next week but believes that most of the rumoured 640 deaths are from natural causes and says the figure is below the average death rate for Kano. Hospital records which provide the only death register available are thought to provide lower numbers than the real picture across the state. Those on the investigating taskforce say they will conduct \"verbal autopsies\" with family members to help establish why people are dying. If not coronavirus, what else could be going on? Private hospitals which provide for a significant part of health provision in the region have been closed due to coronavirus fears. This could mean a lack of support for those with existing conditions who may have died as a result. Dr Nagoma Sadiq who works at the Aminu Kano Hospital, thinks this could be behind the additional deaths, but he is also not ruling out coronavirus. \"It's shocking to most of us that the count of the dead is alarming. But it's likely due to the reduction in the number of health institutions available in the state. \"Because there are a lot of hypertensive patients, diabetic patients, asthmatic patients, cancer patients, and they don't have much access to the hospitals. The lockdown is affecting everybody. \"Our poor majority don't even have a vehicle to take them to the hospitals.\" Grave digger Ali agrees, adding \"some say the current situation is due to the epidemic, others say it's difficulties of life. People have so many problems in their lives and a lack of peace of mind.\" However Covid-19 is known to be more dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, so it could be that the deaths are related to coronavirus. The only way to know for sure is to test for coronavirus. Dr Sadiq also said that there was still a concern about an ongoing Lassa fever infection amongst communities. The state has had five confirmed cases and one death, according to the most recent report from the Nigerian Centre For Disease Control. Kano currently has 77 positive cases of coronavirus with three deaths. Authorities are urging the public not to panic. What else did the president announce? President Buhari announced a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in Abuja, Lagos and neighbouring Ogun state from next Monday. But he also said that the government would impose a curfew across the country between 20:00 and 06:00, require everyone to wear face masks in public, and stop \"non-essential inter-state passenger travel\". Bans on social and religious gatherings will also remain in place.

The \"passionate\" medic was \"always ready to go where people would need his help most,\" the WHO said in a tribute. The motive for the attack is unclear. More than 1,800 people have died from the Ebola virus in the past year. Efforts to contain the spread have been hindered by militia group violence and by suspicion towards foreign medical assistance. Senior military prosecutor Lt Col Jean-Baptiste Kumbu told AFP that militiamen involved in attacking treatment centres, including Butembo hospital, had under interrogation implicated four doctors in planning the raids. He said the three Congolese doctors will be prosecuted for \"terrorism\" and \"criminal conspiracy\", according to AFP, while the fourth doctor was still at large. The current outbreak in eastern DR Congo began in August last year and is the biggest of the 10 to hit the country since 1976, when the virus was first discovered. It is dwarfed by the West African epidemic of 2014-16, which affected 28,616 people mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,310 people died in what was the largest outbreak of the virus ever recorded. Dr Mouzoko was one of a number of medics deployed by the WHO to help fight the spread of the virus in DR Congo. Former colleagues in Madagascar, Cameroon and DR Congo have described Dr Mouzoko as a committed professional, who over the course of his career, helped train hundreds of young doctors and health workers. \"He would regularly spend 15 to 20 days a month working among isolated communities in his home country, Cameroon, far from his wife and 4 children,\" the WHO said in a statement after Dr Mouzoko's death. His funeral in April was attended by the global health body's top official and its Africa director. In a letter to the mayor of Butembo, a group representing local doctors said it was \"indignant\" over the arrests, adding that their absence would cripple vital medical services in the area such as blood transfusions and disease prevention. The group has threatened to strike within 48 hours unless the three detained doctors are released. But the military prosecutor dismissed their demands as \"out of the question\", AFP reports. Why are Ebola workers being attacked? About 200 health facilities have been attacked in DR Congo this year, forcing health workers to suspend or delay vaccinations and treatments. Reuters quotes Lt Col Kumbu as saying a total of 54 people are currently under arrest in connection with attacks on Ebola treatment centres. In February, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) put its activities on hold in Butembo and Katwa - two eastern cities in the outbreak's epicentre. In North Kivu, community-based militia groups called Mai-Mai have been behind some of the attacks against health centres and workers. Another militia group, the Allied Defence Forces (Ugandan rebels operating within DR Congo) have also been accused of causing widespread disruption to medical units. There have also been a series of attacks by other unidentified groups on Ebola response centres. In one incident, family members assaulted health workers who were overseeing the burial of their relative in May. A 2018 study published in the Lancet medical journal says \"belief in misinformation was widespread\" concerning the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu. One in four respondents believed in the statement that Ebola does not exist, with an even higher proportion saying the Ebola outbreak was fabricated for financial gain, or to destabilise the region. \"There's already been civil unrest in the region and that's exacerbated when a foreign response comes into an area that's heavily guarded,\" says Lara Salahi, an author who has written about responses to Ebola outbreaks.", "summary": "Trois médecins ont été arrêtés en République démocratique du Congo pour le meurtre d'un médecin de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), a déclaré un procureur militaire."}

Mr Sanusi, an ex-central bank chief, has had frosty relations with Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje since 2017. His supporters believe he was sacked for opposing Mr Ganduje's re-election last year. Traditional leaders in Nigeria hold few constitutional powers but are able to exert significant influence as they are seen as custodians of both religion and tradition. Mr Sanusi was seen as a reformist and had been critical of some government policies - a stance that frequently put him at loggerheads with ruling politicians, reports the BBC's Nigeria reporter Ishaq Khalid. The emir has been removed from the palace in the city of Kano by security forces. It is not clear where he has been taken, but by tradition he will be expected to live in exile outside the emirate for the rest of his life, our reporter says. Aminu Ado Bayero, the son of Mr Sanusi's predecessor who ruled Kano for more than half a century until his death in 2014, has been chosen as the new emir by the local authorities. Why was he sacked? The government said he was removed \"in order to safeguard the sanctity, culture, tradition, religion and prestige of the Kano emirate\", accusing the emir of \"total disrespect\" of institutions and the governor's office. The emir's role Since the emir and governor fell out, Mr Sanusi has not attended state functions and official meetings, which the government said amounted to \"total insubordination\". The emir's refusal to appear before a panel investigating allegations of corruption against him also did not go down well with the government. He is accused of selling property and mismanaging funds but he secured a court order stopping the probe. After last year's election, Mr Ganduje, who is a powerful figure within Nigeria's governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party, split the Kano emirate into five and appointed four more emirs - to weaken Mr Sanusi's influence. Mr Sanusi is not shy about voicing his opinions, which some say is a break with the tradition that an emir be seen and not heard. Last month, he said fathers who sent their children out to beg for alms should be arrested. In the past he criticised what he described as the \"ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam\" in some parts of northern Nigeria that has discouraged the education of girls, family planning and other progressive policies. Who is Mr Sanusi? Born into the Fulani royal family, Lamido Sanusi became the 14th Emir of Kano in 2014 after the death of Ado Bayero. He described the post, which carries enormous weight among Nigeria's northern Muslims, as a life-long ambition. Five things about Muhammad Sanusi II In the mid-1990s he quit a well-paid job as banking risk manager to deepen his knowledge of Arabic and Islamic studies by going to study in Sudan. Long before he became emir, he opposed the adoption of Islamic law in some northern states, arguing that there were more pressing issues that needed to be dealt with. But it was as governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria that he gained notoriety. His whistle-blowing over $20bn (£12bn) allegedly missing from the state oil company caused a storm that led to his suspension by then President Goodluck Jonathan. The government denied that any money was missing. Mr Sanusi challenged the suspension in court but was still sacked from the role. He later withdrew the court case. Critics say he has a holier-than-thou attitude and have wondered why he refused to appear before the panel investigating corruption allegations against him.

The Ocean Viking, operated by rescue group SOS Méditerranée, declared a state of emergency on Friday, citing fears for the safety of both migrants and crew. The migrants are set to be transferred to a government vessel in Sicily on Monday and will quarantine for 14 days. Medics have already tested those on the Ocean Viking for Covid-19. Results are expected on Monday. The migrants are from a range of countries including Pakistan, Eritrea and Nigeria. They had fled the coast of Libya when they were rescued in four separate groups between 25 and 30 June. They include 25 minors, most of whom are unaccompanied by adults and two women, including one who is pregnant. The ship had been awaiting permission to allow the passengers off the vessel in either Italy or Malta. As time went on, those on board had become desperate to reach land - while others, unable to contact friends and family to let them know they were safe, had become distraught, AFP news agency reports. A doctor for SOS Méditerranée said he had noted \"enormous psychological discomfort on the ship\", where the situation was \"almost out of control, for guests and crew\". One crew member said there had been a series of fights and threats of suicide. An Italian interior ministry source told AFP that a medical team had been sent to the ship ahead of disembarkation. \"We're very happy! We've come a long way, Libya was like hell and now at least we can see the end. I need to tell my family that I'm still alive,\" said one passenger, 27-year-old Rabiul from Bangladesh. SOS Méditerranée wrote on Twitter that the \"unnecessary delay of this disembarkation has put lives at risk\". More than 110,000 migrants tried to cross the Mediterranean last year. More than 1,200 died during the attempt, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, says that more than 24,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Europe by sea during the first six months of this year, although it is thought that warmer weather during summer could lead to an increase in the number of attempts.", "summary": "L'Italie a autorisé 180 migrants sauvés de la Méditerranée à débarquer d'un navire géré par une association caritative."}
