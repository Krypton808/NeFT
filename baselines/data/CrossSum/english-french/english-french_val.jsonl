Known for his bright graphics, jungle inspired prints and eclectic use of colour, he was the first Japanese designer to gain prominence on the Paris fashion scene. He settled in France in the 1960s and spent the rest of his career there. With his \"nearly 8,000 designs\", the Japanese designer \"never stopped celebrating fashion and the art of living\", his spokesman said. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo paid tribute to him on Twitter: \"Designer of immense talent, he had given colour and light their place in fashion. Paris is now mourning one of its sons.\" \"I was a fan of the brand in the 1970s when he started. I think he was a great designer,\" fashion news website WWD.com quoted Sidney Toledano, CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH which owns the Kenzo brand, as saying. Many Japanese Twitter users posted their condolences on the platform, some of whom shared that their first ever luxury product was one from Kenzo. \"The first wallet I ever owned was from Kenzo,\" said one Twitter user. \"Even though it's a small thing - I'll always remember it. Rest in Peace.\" \"I have a Kenzo [outfit] passed down from my mum,\" said another. \"I still wear it.\" Many others said they owned Kenzo handkerchiefs - an accessory which is still popular in Japan. 'Ahead of his time' Born in 1939 in Himeji, near the city of Osaka, Kenzo Takada decided to make his way by boat to Paris in 1965, despite hardly speaking any French. At first he sold sketches to fashion houses but later decided to strike it out on his own, with a small store called Jungle Jap. \"I decorated the shop myself with little money,\" Takada told the South China Morning Post newspaper recently, in what was one of his last media interviews. \"One of the first paintings I saw in Paris and fell in love with was a jungle painting... and that was the inspiration for the shop.\" His clothes were heavily influenced by Japanese designs. Takada said he didn't want to \"do what French designers were doing\". \"His native Japan remained [the] source of inspiration for every collection he did. He kept the use of vibrant colours and volumes present at all times,\" said Circe Henestrosa, head of the school of fashion at Singapore's Lasalle College of the Arts. \"I think he was ahead of his time and was one of the first designers to experiment with the idea of genderless fashion. He would never conform to the stereotypical idea of masculine and feminine fashion,\" said Ms Henestrosa. Takada's \"big break\" finally came when fashion magazine Elle put one of his looks on their cover, and when international fashion magazine editors attended his fashion show in 1971, he told SCMP. Controversial name There was controversy over the brand initially, as Takada had called himself and his label \"Jap\" - a term that some in the United States found offensive, which he discovered when he started reaching out to the American market. \"I knew it had a pejorative meaning,\" he told the New York Times in a 1972 interview. \"But I thought if I did something good, I would change the meaning.\" Takada rechristened the label with his first name - and thus Kenzo the brand was born. It flourished and became an internationally known fashion label, adding a menswear line in 1983 and then more casual sportswear lines Kenzo Jeans and Kenzo Jungle. Kenzo fragrances and eyewear soon followed. Then, at the height of the brand's success in the 1990s, Takada sold it to LVMH. \"The hardest year of my life was 1990, when my life partner Xavier died and my business partner had a stroke,\" he told SCMP. \"That's why I sold the company to LVMH [in 1993]. I felt I couldn't do it on my own.\" He stayed at the label for a few years and retired from fashion in 1999 at the age of 60. But even in his retirement he remained active creatively, designing costumes for opera productions and taking up painting. \"He was supposed to be in Paris only for two years [but] spent the rest of his life there. He took Paris by storm,\" said Ms Henestrosa. \"As [fashion journalist] Suzy Menkes said, 'he wanted to make happy clothes'. His work was avant-garde... it is sad when creative minds like Kenzo leave this world.\"", "summary": "Le fondateur japonais de la marque de mode Kenzo est décédé à l'âge de 81 ans, des suites de complications liées au coronavirus.

Twitter said it had tested for racial and gender bias during the algorithm's development. But it added: \"It's clear that we've got more analysis to do.\" Twitter's chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal, tweeted: \"We did analysis on our model when we shipped it - but [it] needs continuous improvement. \"Love this public, open, and rigorous test - and eager to learn from this.\" Facial hair The latest controversy began when university manager Colin Madland, from Vancouver, was troubleshooting a colleague's head vanishing when using videoconference app Zoom. The software was apparently mistakenly identifying the black man's head as part of the background and removing it. But when Mr Madland posted about the topic on Twitter, he found his face - and not his colleague's - was consistently chosen as the preview on mobile apps, even if he flipped the order of the images. His discovery prompted a range of other experiments by users, which, for example, suggested: Twitter's chief design officer, Dantley Davis, found editing out Mr Madland's facial hair and glasses seemed to correct the problem - \"because of the contrast with his skin\". Responding to criticism, he tweeted: \"I know you think it's fun to dunk on me - but I'm as irritated about this as everyone else. However, I'm in a position to fix it and I will. \"It's 100% our fault. No-one should say otherwise.\" 'Many questions' Zehan Wang, a research engineering lead and co-founder of the neural networks company Magic Pony, which has been acquired by Twitter, said tests on the algorithm in 2017, using pairs of faces belonging to different ethnicities, had found \"no significant bias between ethnicities (or genders)\" - but Twitter would now review that study. \"There are many questions that will need time to dig into,\" he said. \"More details will be shared after internal teams have had a chance to look at it.\" Late last year, a US government study suggested facial-recognition algorithms were much less accurate at identifying black and Asian faces than white ones. In the UK, police officers last year raised concerns about algorithms \"amplifying\" prejudices and called for clearer guidelines on using the technology. And, in June this year, similar concerns led IBM to announce it would no longer offer facial-recognition software for \"mass surveillance or racial profiling\".", "summary": "Twitter mène une enquête après que les utilisateurs ont découvert que son algorithme de recadrage des images préfère parfois les visages blancs aux visages noirs."}

Despite being a statutory body, the commission said its inquiry was hampered by the \"disappearance\" of patients' files, and its investigators had received a \"hostile reception\" from hospital staff. The commission said its investigators visited 15 hospitals after civil rights groups brought the cases, some dating back to 2001, to its attention. South Africa's health department has not yet given a detailed response to the report, but said its minister, Zweli Mkhize, had requested a meeting with the commission to discuss it. Ms Msibi recalled her ordeal to the BBC's Clare Spencer: I woke up after giving birth, looked down and asked: \"Why do I have a huge bandage on my stomach?\" I did not mind. I had just given birth to my baby daughter. She was a big baby and I had been anaesthetised and gone through a Caesarean section. Hysterectomy:Removal of womb or part of it Tubal ligation:Fallopian tubes blocked or sealed I left hospital five days after giving birth, with a healthy baby daughter and a huge scar across my stomach. I did not find out what had really happened for another 11 years. Things unravelled when I was trying to conceive again. I had been taking the contraceptive pill for that whole time since I had given birth and so it was not strange that I had not had my period. But I got engaged and wanted to have another baby so went to the doctor. He examined me, sat me down, gave me a glass of water and told me I had no uterus. 'It is very cruel' I was devastated and confused. It did not make sense because I was already a mother. I worked out my uterus must have been removed and the only time it could have happened was after I had given birth. It is very cruel what they did to me. I went to the press, then the health ministry and eventually ended up back at the hospital where I gave birth with the doctor who said he was there that day. He did not say sorry. He told me that he had sterilised me in order to save my life. I still do not know what he was trying to save me from. There are no records at the hospital. I am not the only one. An inquiry has found there are 47 others. Some were told it was because they had HIV, but I do not. I just don't know why they did it. The doctor told me that I had signed a consent form. I had not. I was a minor at the time so would not have been able to. He then said my mother, who was with me at the birth, had signed the consent form. She said she did not. The news changed my life. More on women's issues in Africa: In the end I split up with my fiancé. I had to let him go because he really wanted children and I could not give him that. When I met the doctor I was asked what I want. I want a baby so badly. When I saw a pregnant colleague this week I could not stand it. My daughter wants a sibling and when we go past street kids she suggests I bring one up as my own. I still have ovaries and so I think the hospital should pay for a surrogate. Adultsentitled to it through safe methods Procedure must be clearly explained, including risks and consequences Consent can be withdrawn at anytime Formsgiving go-ahead must be understood and signed Separate rules must be followed for those \"incapable\" of consenting I also want somebody to be held accountable. We cannot allow doctors to keep on doing this because our rights as women are being violated. Doctors need to know that they are under scrutiny, that we know what they get up to when we are lifeless. And then I want the doctor who did this to say he is sorry. The way this has been handled, you would think they had just removed a finger when actually this is my entire womanhood they have stolen. I can never get over that and the scar will always be a reminder.

Its makers said that many of the largest brands used email pixels, with the exception of the \"big tech\" firms. Defenders of the trackers say they are a commonplace marketing tactic. And several of the companies involved noted their use of such tech was mentioned within their wider privacy policies. Emails pixels can be used to log: This information can then be used to determine the impact of a specific email campaign, as well as to feed into more detailed customer profiles. Hey's co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson says they amount to a \"grotesque invasion of privacy\". And other experts have also questioned whether companies are being as transparent as required under law about their use. Invisible beacons Tracking pixels are typically a .GIF or .PNG file that is as small as 1x1 pixels, which is inserted into the header, footer or body of an email. Since they often show the colour of the content below, they can be impossible to spot with the naked eye even if you know where to look. Recipients do not need to click on a link or do anything to activate them beyond open an email they are embedded in. British Airways, TalkTalk, Vodafone, Sainsbury's, Tesco, HSBC, Marks & Spencer, Asos and Unilever are among UK brands Hey detected to be using them. But their use was much more widespread despite many members of the public being unaware of it, said Mr Hansson. \"It's not like there's a flag saying 'this email includes a spy pixel' in most email software,\" he added. Hey does offer such a facility, but users must pay an annual subscription. Alternatively, users can install free plug-ins into other email programs to strip out many pixel trackers. Other options are to simply set their software to block all images by default, or to view emails as plain text. \"On average, every Hey customer receives 24 emails per day that attempt to spy on them,\" Mr Hansson said. \"The top 10% of users receive more than 50. \"We're processing over one million emails a day and we're just a tiny service compared to the likes of Gmail, but that's north of 600,000 spying attempts blocked every day.\" The BBC also uses email pixels in some of its communications, although this was not picked up by Hey. Follow-up phone calls Tracking pixels are a standard feature of automated email services used by large and small businesses, and in many cases the facility is difficult to turn off. Two years ago Superhuman, a consumer-focused email client, tried to extend their use to the public as a default feature of its own, but reversed course after a public outcry. That had little impact on the marketing industry's continued reliance on the tech. Clients can use them to track how many emails in a specific campaign are opened in aggregate, as well as to automatically stop sending messages to customers who ignore them. But a study by Princeton University also indicated the data gathered was sometimes linked to a users' cookies. This allows an individual's email address to be tied to their wider browsing habits, even as they move from one device to another. \"The resulting links between identities and web history profiles belie the claim of 'anonymous' web tracking,\" the paper warned. In addition, trackers can also lead to personalised follow-ups. \"Particularly with salespeople or consultants, they can go: 'I saw you open my email yesterday, but you haven't replied yet. Can I call?'\" said Mr Hansson. \"And in some cases they get outright belligerent when they see you've opened it three times but have still not replied.\" Privacy laws Use of tracking pixels is governed in the UK and other parts of Europe by 2003's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (Pecr) and 2016's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They require organisations to inform recipients of the pixels, and in most cases to obtain consent. One privacy consultant said the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had previously ruled that such consent must be \"unambiguous\" and \"a clear affirmative act\". \"Solely placing something in a privacy notice is not consent, and it is hardly transparent,\" said Pat Walshe from Privacy Matters. \"The fact that tracking will take place and what that involves should be put in the user's face and involve them opting in. \"The law is clear enough, what we need is regulatory enforcement. Just because this practice is widespread doesn't mean it's correct and acceptable.\" Mr Walshe noted that the ICO had used a pixel within its own e-newsletter. The watchdog told the BBC it was used to track email openings, but not users' locations, adding: \"We're working with our provider to remove the pixel functionality and this should be completed soon.\" The BBC asked some of the companies identified by Hey for their own response. British Airways said: \"We take customer data extremely seriously, and use a cross-industry standard approach that allows us to understand how effective our customer communications are.\" TalkTalk said: \"As is common across our industry and others, we track the performance of different types of communications to understand what our customers prefer. We do not share this data externally.\"", "summary": "L'utilisation d'une technologie de suivi \"invisible\" dans les courriels est maintenant \"endémique\", selon un service de messagerie qui a analysé son trafic à la demande de la BBC."}

Meanwhile, Morrisons said it had already removed products made with monkey-picked coconuts from its shelves. In a statement, Waitrose said: \"As part of our animal welfare policy, we have committed to never knowingly sell any products sourced from monkey labour.\" Co-op said: \"As an ethical retailer, we do not permit the use of monkey labour to source ingredients for our products.\" In a tweet earlier on Friday, the prime minister's fiancée Carrie Symonds, a conservationist, called on all supermarkets to boycott the products.

The four-year-old's father, who had left him in their flat and gone shopping, faces charges of failing to look after his child, reports say. Mr Gassama will be given citizenship. French President Emmanuel Macron personally thanked him, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. More details have begun to emerge of the circumstances surrounding the incident. Why was the boy on the balcony? The boy left Réunion, where his mother and grandmother live, about three weeks ago and moved to Paris to join his father, who works in the city. His mother and the couple's second child were due to join them in June. The father lived on the sixth-floor of the building in northern Paris, the building's concierge told BFMTV. The boy had already fallen two storeys before somehow managing to grab hold of the fourth-floor balcony, according to this version of events. When asked by a resident in the neighbouring fourth-floor flat where he lived, he is reported to have pointed upwards. His mother told Antenne Réunion that the boy's father was not used to looking after him on his own and had left him alone before. \"I can't justify what my husband did. People will say it could have happened to anyone and it has happened to other people. My son was just lucky,\" she said. After doing the shopping, the boy's father had delayed going home to play Pokemon Go, prosecutors said. Could the neighbour have done more? Some reaction to the incident has focused on a man on the balcony of the neighbouring fourth-floor flat, who appears to be close enough to the boy to lift him before Mr Gassama arrives. But the neighbour told Le Parisien newspaper that he was holding on to the boy's hand but could not pull him up because of a divider separating the two balconies. \"I didn't want to take the risk of letting go of his hand, I thought it better to do things step by step,\" he said. He said the boy had been wearing a Spiderman outfit, was bleeding from his toe and had a torn nail. Firefighters came into his flat and climbed over the balcony divider to reach the boy and Mr Gassama, he said. Where is the boy now? He has been taken into care by the French authorities, French media said. The father is reported to have been left devastated by what happened, BFMTV said. The French offence of failing in one's legal duty as a parent can be punished by two years in prison and a fine of €30,000 ($35,000; £26,000). His mother is also due to be interviewed by social workers in Réunion, Antenne Réunion said. Speaking to French TV station RMC, the boy's grandmother described how she felt seeing the video of her grandson hanging off the balcony. \"My God, I was very shocked. My grandson, my grandson, save him!\" she said. \"Thankfully he [Mr Gassama] knew how to climb, because there were a lot of people below but he didn't just fold his arms. He raced up to the fourth floor. That was truly incredible. He was very brave,\" she said. Who is Mamoudou Gassama? The 22-year-old left the town of Yaguine in south-western Mali as a teenager in 2013. He took the migrant route across the Sahara desert through Burkina Faso, Niger and Libya, and crossed the Mediterranean to Italy in 2014 at the second attempt after having once been intercepted at sea by police. \"I had no means to live and no-one to help me,\" Mr Gassama told Mr Macron. During his journey, he spent a year working in Libya, where migrants are frequently exploited and even enslaved by gangs. \"I suffered a lot. We were caught and beaten but I did not lose hope,\" he said. He told Mr Macron that he had travelled to France because he did not know anyone in Italy and his brother had been living in France for many years. In Paris he worked cash-in-hand on building sites and lived in a hostel in the eastern suburb of Montreuil - known as \"little Bamako\" because of its large Malian population. He had not applied for asylum and was living illegally in France. In the hostel, he has been sharing a room with relatives and sleeping on a mattress on the floor. On Monday Mr Gassama met another Malian migrant given French citizenship for his acts of courage - Lassana Bathily, who helped customers in a Jewish supermarket in western Paris hide when a supporter of the Islamic State group took hostages there in 2015. Mr Bathily, who has written a book about his experience, said Mr Gassama was \"still in a state of emotion\" following his daring rescue. \"He asked me about my experience and what I went through during the attack to get some advice,\" Mr Bathily told BFMTV. \"We weren't in it for anything but afterwards everyone was interested in us. \"He reacted like a human being. He didn't think it would become a media event.\" On Tuesday Mr Gassama received French residency, a first step towards citizenship.

It has been criticised by Human Rights Watch for not explicitly criminalising marital rape and lacking a precise definition of domestic violence. A government survey found that 63% of women between the ages of 18-65 had been victims of violence. Samira Raiss, one of the main Moroccan campaigners for a law criminalising violence against women, said: \"We will not stop here. This law is an asset but it has shortcomings that we have to work on.\" The law - known as the Hakkaoui law after Women's Minister Bassima Hakkaoui, who drafted it five years ago - has been criticised for requiring victims to file for criminal prosecution to obtain protection. \"We lack the appropriate tools to implement this law,\" Ms Raiss said. \"In case of marital violence it is difficult to provide proof and we don't even have shelters for victims.\" How to be invisible By Mouna Ba, BBC Arabic I perfected the art of being invisible while growing up in the Moroccan city of Rabat - or so I thought. All I had to do was: When I started secondary school, my parents decided that I was old enough to do the 15-minute walk by myself to school. That was my first brush with the reality of being a girl on a Moroccan street. One day, two young men blocked my way. One flashed a knife hidden under his shirt and said I had to follow them. I told them I had to take a test and would be in big trouble if I was late to school… and they let me go. It was a lucky escape and it could have ended very differently. Another incident was when a boy began hurling verbal abuse at me. I stopped, looked at him in the eye and said: \"You don't even know me. Why are you insulting me?\" He was so taken aback by my reaction that he apologised. But I wasn't always that brave. I usually pretended not to hear the cat calls and insults. The battle wasn't worth fighting. Morocco's new law on violence against women is a long time coming. Its provisions include penalties ranging one to six months prison sentence to up to a $500 fine for cases of sexual harassment against women in the street and public spaces. It is music to my ears, although I will have to see how seriously it will be implemented. Human Rights Watch said the law has some positive aspects, \"such as a definition of violence against women to mean 'any act based on gender discrimination that entails physical, psychological, sexual, or economic harm to a woman'.\" But it contains \"major gaps and flaws that leave women at risk of domestic violence, including a lack of provisions to finance the reforms,\" HRW says. Bouthaina Karouri, a member of the parliamentary committee that drafted the law, says the law can be changed in the future to remedy any oversights. \"No law is perfect\" Ms Karouri said. \"Its effectiveness will depend on the approach adopted by the police and the judicial body. As it goes into effect, it is normal to discover some gaps but they can be amended in the future.\" The law comes into effect following last month's massive outcry over the alleged rape, torture and kidnapping of a 17-year-old girl named as Khadija. Many went on social media, sharing the hashtag #JusticePourKhadija to describe their disgust and horror and calling on the authorities to take action. In 2014, Morocco's parliament amended an article of the penal code that allowed rapists of underage girls to avoid prosecution by marrying their victims.", "summary": "Une nouvelle loi criminalisant les violences sexuelles et le harcèlement entre en vigueur au Maroc."}

Astrid says at first she did think about how some people might react to their relationship, particularly how her grandparents would react to Mike. \"Because of World War Two, my grandpa expressed certain views towards Africans, so I worried about how he would be. \"But when he met Mike, he loved him. Sometimes I over-think how people will react.\" The couple, who are both 28, welcomed their first daughter a year ago and gave her five names so that she would have links to both her European and African descent. They say they think it is time for people to drop the inter-racial label, and see mixed couples as the norm. Speaking about the royal relationship, Astrid says: \"I think it's amazing. It shows how diverse and modern the Royal Family are. \"This will set a great example for England and it's an honest representation of British society.\" 'You can't live for others' Shantania Beckford, 24, and Billy Clifford, 23, from Birmingham, are from Jamaican and English heritage. The couple, who met online, collectively have a social media following of over 300,000, and they say their public mixed relationship has resulted in some insults and trolling. \"Some people don't believe that black and white should be together, but we laugh it off. \"We can't let negative stuff get to us, we delete the comments and get over it. \"You can't live for other people, you have to live for you.\" Despite being in a mixed relationship, Shantania says that when she first found out about Prince Harry and Ms Markle's relationship, she was surprised. \"To be honest with you, I didn't think they were going to let a black person into the Royal Family. \"Meghan really has substance to her, but I wonder how the Queen feels?\" The couple believe this is a step forward for the future of the Royal Family. \"People will be a lot more accepting of mixed couples now, and talk about interracial issues. \"I'm happy for them, it's a positive thing.\" 'I don't see how it's an issue' Sara Khoo, 23, is of mixed Icelandic and Chinese heritage and Adam D'hill, 28, is Portuguese and African American. The couple have been together for two years, after meeting in Brighton. They say their families were accepting of their relationship, and say that in this day and age \"it's difficult to still have biased views\". Sara says: \"I was scared to introduce Adam to my family because he's a boy, not because he's black - that's never been a problem.\" When asked about Prince Harry's relationship, they both felt it was a \"great thing\". \"We find it hard to comment, because I don't see how people would have an issue with their relationship; we don't see it as a problem.\" 'What are my parents going to say about this?' English-born Andrea Walker, from Sheffield, met her Pakistani husband Zahid in 1987. The couple got married and had three children before splitting up four years later. When introducing Zahid to her family, Andrea, 55, remembers her main worry being the fact he was from a different religious background. \"It wasn't about the race, but the religion. I was worried about how my parents would react. \"I was brought up in a Christian home, so in my head I thought 'what are my parents going to say about this?'\" She says both her and Zahid's family gave their blessing to the relationship, but her colleagues and some strangers were not as accepting. On one occasion, Andrea says, she was told off at work for wearing trousers. \"Someone told my boss I wore trousers because I was married to a Muslim man; he called me in and demanded I start wearing a skirt.\" Following the birth of her first son, she says, people were often curious to see him. \"I would see them looking, and they'd try to look into the pram to see what colour the baby was.\" Andrea says that since the 80s people's attitudes towards mixed marriages have changed, but she is unsure whether or not an interracial royal marriage will be met with open arms. \"I think royalists are going to be really torn with this relationship - yes, she's part black, but she's also very good looking and smart, so it may not be a huge problem. \"Racism is always going to be around no matter what, but you'd hope people would get over it.\" And as for the prince and Ms Markle, she said: \"I think it's exciting.\"", "summary": "La relation entre l'afro-américaine Meghan Markle et le prince Harry est une grande première, selon Geopolis."}

Since then police have seized more than 900,000 litres. Patna city's top police official, Manu Maharaj, said he was told by police inspectors on Tuesday that much of that liquor had been lost to rats. Police have now ordered an inquiry to examine these claims. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced the alcohol ban soon after taking office last year. It was seen as a way of reducing domestic violence, harassment and poverty. Police subsequently launched search operations across the state to confiscate alcohol. They also arrested more than 40,000 people for illegally keeping alcohol in their homes and shops. The operation resulted in massive stocks of alcohol bottles kept in police stations as evidence. Some police stations even rented private storage facilities for the bottles. More than 1,000 police stations in the state have now been ordered to routinely audit their stock of confiscated alcohol. Mr Maharaj told The Hindu newspaper that officers would also be routinely checked for alcohol consumption. \"If they fail the test they could even lose their jobs, apart from being prosecuted under the new stringent excise and prohibition laws,\" he said.

It is the subject of a dispute between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which has been seeking to establish an independent state. Morocco is the fourth state to make such a deal with Israel since August. Agreements have also been struck recently with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan. Along with Egypt and Jordan, Morocco becomes the sixth Arab League member to normalise ties with Israel. What is the deal? US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Twitter on Thursday. \"Another HISTORIC breakthrough today! Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations - a massive breakthrough for peace in the Middle East!\" he wrote. The White House said Mr Trump and Morocco's King Mohammed VI had agreed that Morocco would \"resume diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel and expand economic and cultural co-operation to advance regional stability\". The deal includes the reopening of liaison offices in Tel Aviv and Rabat - shut in 2000 when low-level relations broke down after the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising - and the eventual opening of embassies. Officials said Morocco would grant direct flights to and from Israel for all Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the \"historic\" agreement. In a televised address, he thanked Morocco's king and said the people of Israel and Morocco have had a \"warm relationship in the modern period\". In Morocco, a palace statement confirmed the deal, saying the king, in a telephone call with Mr Trump, had agreed to diplomatic relations with Israel \"with minimal delay\". Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain issued statements welcoming the deal between Morocco and Israel. Palestinian officials condemned the agreement, saying it encouraged Israel's denial of their rights. Palestinians have been critical of all the recent deals between Israel and Arab League countries. They believe the moves renege on a promise by Arab states not to embrace ties with Israel until Palestinian statehood is achieved. Morocco's king said the \"measures do not in any manner affect Morocco's ongoing and sustained commitment to the just Palestinian cause\", a royal statement said. The statement added that the king had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and assured him that he \"would never relinquish his role in defending the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people\". It said the king had reiterated his support for a two-state solution. What about Western Sahara? The White House said the US would recognise Morocco's claim over Western Sahara as part of the deal. In a phone call with the Moroccan king, Mr Trump \"reaffirmed his support for Morocco's serious, credible, and realistic autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory and as such the president recognised Moroccan sovereignty over the entire Western Sahara territory,\" the White House said. A former Spanish colony, it was annexed by Morocco in 1975. Since then it has been the subject of a long-running territorial dispute between Morocco and its indigenous Saharawi people, led by the pro-independence Polisario Front. Morocco says it has always been part of its territory, while the African Union recognises it as an independent state. A 16-year-long insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence, which has yet to take place. Responding to the latest announcement, Sidi Omar, the Polisario Front's representative to the UN, said Western Sahara's \"legal status is determined by international law and UN resolutions\". \"The move shows that Morocco's regime is willing to sell its soul to maintain its illegal occupation of parts of Western Sahara,\" he wrote on Twitter. The group's Europe representative, Oubi Bchraya, said the change in US policy \"will not change an inch of the reality of the conflict and the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination\", Reuters reports. Last month, the Polisario Front said the three-decades-old ceasefire had been ended by a Moroccan military operation in a buffer zone. Lotfi Bouchaara, Morocco's ambassador to Moscow, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that Morocco did not breach the ceasefire but that its military was responding to a provocation by Polisario fighters who had blocked a key road to Mauritania. Morocco had reacted with \"restraint\", he said. A White House proclamation on Thursday said the US believed that an independent Sahrawi State is \"not a realistic option for resolving the conflict and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution\". Morocco's royal court said Washington would open a consulate in Western Sahara as part of its deal with Israel, according to Reuters. How the deal will affect Western Sahara Analysis by Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent, Tunis The latest move by the Trump administration will not necessarily have an immediate impact on the ground because the dispute is seen as greater than the whims of the American president. However, Trump's backing of Morocco's claim to sovereignty over Western Sahara is a big deal because it diminishes the hope of a people who have aspired for independence of that territory for decades. The UN is still mandated to oversee a referendum for independence of Western Sahara - although this hasn't materialised since 1991, when it established its mission there known as Minurso. In the absence of a referendum, the protracted stalemate between Morocco and the Polisario Front ultimately boils down to international recognition - a new independent state cannot be established without it. Today, the idea of an independent Western Sahara may have been significantly diminished - and the tensions that have been building up in recent months could worsen.", "summary": "Le Maroc est devenu le dernier pays de la Ligue arabe à accepter de normaliser ses relations avec Israël dans le cadre d'un accord négocié avec l'aide des États-Unis."}

The Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving royal consort in British history, was at the Queen's side for more than her six decades of reign. Boris Johnson said he \"inspired the lives of countless young people\". \"It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband,\" the Palace said. \"The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\" It is understood that the Prince of Wales travelled from his home in Gloucestershire to visit his mother at Windsor Castle on Friday afternoon. Speaking at Downing Street, the prime minister said that the duke had \"earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth, and around the world\". Meanwhile, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he \"consistently put the interests of others ahead of his own and, in so doing, provided an outstanding example of Christian service\". In tribute to the duke, Westminster Abbey began tolling its tenor bell once every 60 seconds at 18:00 BST. It rang out 99 times to honour each year of his life. Earlier, the flag at Buckingham Palace was lowered to half-mast and a notice was posted on the gates to mark the duke's death. People placed floral tributes outside the palace, while hundreds visited Windsor Castle to pay their respects. However, the government urged the public not to gather or leave tributes at royal residences amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving flowers in memory of the duke, and an online book of condolence has been launched on the official royal website for those who wish to send messages. A message on the website of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's non-profit organisation Archewell paid tribute to the \"loving memory\" of the Duke of Edinburgh, saying: \"Thank you for your service... you will be greatly missed.\" From midday on Saturday, a 41-gun salute will take place for Prince Philip in cities including London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as in Gibraltar and at sea from Royal Navy warships, the Ministry of Defence said. They will be broadcast online and on television for the public to watch from home. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said it was \"a moment of sadness\" for the country and \"most particularly, for the Queen losing her husband of 73 years - a bigger span of years than most of us can imagine\". He said Prince Philip had made \"a huge contribution to the success of the Queen's reign\", describing the duke as \"utterly loyal in his belief in the importance of the role that the Queen was fulfilling - and in his duty to support her\". \"It was the importance of the solidity of that relationship, of their marriage, that was so crucial to the success of her reign,\" he added. A bank of photographers and cameramen were lined up around the growing number of tributes at Buckingham Palace on Friday afternoon, said BBC News reporter Marie Jackson. Rhea Varma, from Pimlico, pulled up to the gates on her bike to lay flowers and a note saying Rest in Peace Duke. She said the news was \"super sad\". To her, the duke was \"the kind of stability that's so old-fashioned it's difficult to comprehend. He was a rock who brought integrity.\" Reaction to death of Prince Philip Adam Wharton-Ward, 36, also arrived to leave lilies by the palace gates. He is visiting London from his home in France but was so moved by the news, he wanted to \"rally round\" for the Queen's sake. \"It's so sad. He's been with her for 73 years. If it wasn't for him who knows if she would have got through it,\" he said. The duke's appeal, he added, was that he was \"almost normal with his gaffes\". \"Now that normality has gone,\" he said. The prince married Princess Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became Queen. In March, the duke left King Edward VII's hospital in central London after a month-long stay for treatment. He was admitted on 16 February after feeling unwell, and later underwent a procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at another London hospital - St Bartholomew's. 'Quiet reflection' in Windsor By Helena Wilkinson, BBC News correspondent at Windsor Castle This is a town that's seen many royal events over the years, both happy and sad. Today, it is one of quiet reflection. The sun has been shining down on Windsor Castle this afternoon, but the mood outside is understandably sombre. As locals heard of the duke's death they turned up to leave flowers outside the entrance. One young boy, Oscar, came with his mother to lay flowers. He left a card which read: \"Your Majesty, so sorry about hearing about your amazing husband.\" \"It's really sad,\" another woman told us. \"I just wanted him to get to 100,\" she said. The flag here hasn't been lowered to half-mast. That's because it's the Royal Standard which means the Queen is in residence. It's the one flag which remains at full mast. It was here that the duke spent his last weeks after being discharged from hospital. Inside the castle the Queen, now a widow, is in mourning for her husband who has always been by her side. Prince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel, Windsor - but the arrangements have been amended in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the College of Arms said in a statement. It added that the funeral will not be a state funeral, and the duke will not lie in state. The duke will, however, lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of a funeral, the College of Arms said, \"in line with custom and with His Royal Highness's wishes\". The statement said: \"The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral.\" Buckingham Palace will confirm the detailed arrangements for the funeral on the Royal website, it added. All UK government buildings have been told to fly an official flags at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 BST on the day after the funeral. Prince Philip and the Queen had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Their first son, the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, was born in 1948, followed by his sister, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, in 1950, the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, in 1960 and the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, in 1964. Prince Philip was born on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice, was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg and a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Politicians across the UK were united in mourning following the announcement of the duke's death. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK had \"lost an extraordinary public servant\", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said his \"long contribution to public life in Scotland will leave a profound mark on its people\". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the duke \"served the crown with selfless devotion and generosity of spirit\". Parliament will honour the duke on Monday, with the House of Commons sitting at 14:30 BST for tributes following his death. Parties have also suspended their campaigning elections on 6 May, which will see voters head to the polls for council and mayoral positions in England, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament. Meanwhile, Commonwealth leaders led international reaction to the duke's death. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison tweeted that the duke \"embodied a generation that we will never see again\", while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described Philip as a \"man of great purpose and conviction\". And Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the duke for his \"distinguished career in the military\" and work \"at the forefront of many community service initiatives\". US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined other world leaders in sending their \"deepest condolences\" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the people of the UK. In a statement, they said the duke \"gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK, the Commonwealth, and to his family\". \"His legacy will live on, not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavours he shipped,\" it said. The palace said further announcements would be made \"in due course\".", "summary": "Le Prince Philip, époux de la Reine Elizabeth II, est décédé à l'âge de 99 ans, a annoncé le Palais de Buckingham."}

Mr Reilly said the issue is \"close to their royal highnesses' hearts\". Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, touched down in Casablanca airport on Saturday evening, although flight delays meant they were two hours late for their welcoming ceremony. They entered the airport's royal suite where they were offered the traditional welcome of milk and dates.

During their visit to Morocco - which will be an important market for the UK after Brexit - the pair will visit the famous Atlas Mountains and the country's capital, Rabat. They will see a girls' education project, meet young social entrepreneurs and visit programmes working with children with disabilities and those with mental health problems. Britain's ambassador to Morocco, Mr Reilly, said: \"I'm really excited to showcase the vital roles that girls' education and youth employment are playing in shaping modern Morocco. \"When we began planning for this visit, I had a very clear view in my mind of the story we wanted this visit to tell.

Several busloads of police in riot gear arrived at the camps early on Wednesday. After a stand-off with local activists, the officers moved in and told migrants to pack their bags. Paul Adams, BBC News, Calais The camps are cleared, but what happens next? Having failed to explain their plan until after the appearance of riot police, the Calais authorities should not be surprised that no-one seems to trust their intentions. The buses stand empty. Repeated efforts by local officials to explain their proposals are met with disbelief. This is just the latest episode in a long-running saga. The migrants complain that they live like animals, with minimal shelter, appalling sanitation and little food. Now the authorities are offering to provide a shower, clean clothes and a better place to live. But the migrants, urged on by local activists, are refusing to co-operate.

He said that people who had tested positive for the virus had been found in hotels across the state. But he did not say if anyone who had Covid-19 had been staying in either of the demolished hotels. 'We refused to pay bribe' The managers of both businesses have been arrested, but the owner of Prodest Home has denied that his hotel was open. \"The hotel was not operating and 70% of the staff had been sent away,\" Gogorobari Promise Needam told the BBC. \"There were only three people on ground. \"[Officials] came in and were asking for bribe, they said they would let us operate if we gave them money but we said we were not operational so had no money to give,\" he said. The Rivers state government denies the accusation. The state currently has 15 active cases of the virus and has recorded two deaths. A lockdown was imposed on the state capital, Port Harcourt, last Thursday. Nigeria has more than 4,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus overall, with the commercial capital, Lagos, at the epicentre. But a lockdown that was imposed there, and in some other states, at the end of March has been partially eased. Legal experts have told the BBC that the actions of the Rivers state governor could be challenged in court. Strict lockdown But the state government says Mr Wike signed an executive order granting him the power to enforce the lockdown. The state has been criticised for its strict lockdown rules, which ordered markets and places selling food to shut down. Doctors, pharmacists and other essential workers have also reported that they have been harassed and in some cases arrested for breaching the lockdown. The authorities have erected barriers on the main highway on its eastern border to enforce a ban on interstate travel, accusing security personnel of smuggling in people under the cover of darkness. Officials are also planning to auction vehicles seized from those who violated the lockdown. Only those who receive a special pass, personally issued by the governor, are allowed to move. But, it seems only those in government house have the document outlining the exact provisions of the executive order as residents of the state told the BBC they are not aware of it. State officials did not respond to the BBC's request for a copy of the order. 'Abuse of office' Lawyer Ahmed Abass told the BBC that an executive order cannot give the governor powers to demolish a building. \"An executive order is made by the president or governor in furtherance of existing laws,\" he said adding that it cannot go beyond the constitution, which guarantees a fair trial. \"What [Mr Wike] should have done was to have arrested the [hotel owners], taken them to court and the court would have prosecuted them,\" he told the BBC. He described the governor's actions as \"executive recklessness and an abuse of office\". Nigeria operates a federal system of government and states can make certain laws for their jurisdiction. You may also like: Mr Wike personally moved around in the first three days of the lockdown to monitor compliance and said he was satisfied that people were obeying. In one incident, captured on video, he ordered the arrest of two people out on the road and asked that they be taken directly to an isolation centre. In another video he said medics were abusing their privilege as essential workers, accusing male doctors of using the opportunity to visit their girlfriends. More than 200 people were arrested on the first day of the lockdown and taken to an isolation centre. A mobile court later convicted 170 of them with fines up to 50,000 naira (£103, $128). The BBC's Karina Igonikon in Port Harcourt says people have been struggling under the strict lockdown rules and that might have influenced the state government's decision to ease it on Sunday.

Offering its condolences, the hospital said it took accusations of discrimination very seriously but could not comment on specific patients. Black people are at greater risk from Covid than white people, studies show. Dr Moore, 52, passed away at another local hospital on Sunday. In her 4 December post on Facebook, she described how her pain had been downplayed by the doctor, whom she said was white, though she had been crying and having difficulty breathing. \"He did not even listen to my lungs, he didn't touch me in any way. He performed no physical exam. I told him you cannot tell me how I feel,\" she wrote. A statement from the hospital said \"as an organisation committed to equity and reducing racial disparities in healthcare, we take accusations of discrimination very seriously and investigate every allegation\". \"We stand by the commitment and expertise of our caregivers and the quality of care delivered to our patients every day,\" it added. Dr Moore is survived by her 19-year-old son, Henry, and her parents, who suffer from dementia, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the family's expenses. The page has already raised more than $102,000 (£75,000). 'This is how black people get killed' Dr Moore tested positive for Covid-19 on 29 November and was admitted with a high fever while she coughed up blood and struggled to breathe. But even as a physician herself, she said she had struggled with getting care. Dr Moore said she had had to plead for antiviral Remdesivir doses and request a scan of her chest. The doctor at one point reportedly told her she did not qualify for the drug and that she should go home. \"He made me feel like I was a drug addict,\" Dr Moore said in a Facebook video. \"And he knew I was a physician. I don't take narcotics. I was hurting.\" Dr Moore wrote she had requested a medical advocate and had asked to be transferred elsewhere. She was eventually discharged but had to return hours later after experiencing a drop in blood pressure and fever. \"This is how black people get killed,\" Dr Moore said. \"When you send them home and they don't know how to fight for themselves.\" Her post later included an update saying the hospital's chief medical officer had said staff would receive diversity training. But a promise for an apology from the doctor she accused of discrimination fell through. \"I put forward and I maintain, if I was white, I wouldn't have to go through that,\" she said. Dr Moore's experience and death has sparked an outcry over US healthcare disparities faced by black Americans. The virus has disproportionately affected black and other minority communities in the US. Black Americans are three times more likely to die from the virus than white Americans. An analysis by the Brookings Institution reported \"in every age category, black people are dying from Covid at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older\". A 2015 paper published in the American Journal of Public Health found \"most health care providers appear to have implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of colour\".", "summary": "Un médecin noir d'Indianapolis est mort avec Covid-19 quelques semaines après avoir accusé un médecin de lui refuser des soins médicaux appropriés en raison de sa race."}

It's a TikTok trend, Ronke explains. Those who would normally go to nightclubs have been taking to social media instead. They picture themselves transitioning from pyjamas into glamorous evening-wear - as if by magic. \"They're getting all made up… to go nowhere!\" she laughs. The soundtrack to the challenge is a tune by rapper-comedian Falz. \"It really is just a guy talking about himself, and how he's going to be your everything,\" says Ronke. \"The lyrics may not always make much sense, but the important thing is that it's fun to dance to while at home.\" 2. Everything I Wanted (Billie Eilish) - chosen by Tebogo from Gabz FM in Gaborone, Botswana Billie Eilish's sombre song recounts a nightmare in which she takes her own life - but nobody cares. It's hardly music to blast away the lockdown blues. But news reporter Tebogo insists it's an apt choice for the present time, which is why Gabz FM has been playing it loads. \"It relates to the state of mind Botswana is in,\" he says. \"There's a bit of uncertainty. You're not sure where things are going to end up. But you have no choice other than to remain hopeful.\" In her track, Eilish ultimately finds solace in those people closest to her, namely her brother Finneas. 3. Imagine (John Lennon) - chosen by Michael from Metro Plus in Hong Kong John Lennon's famous song appeals for unity and compassion. And Michael at Hong Kong's Metro Plus thinks people in Hong Kong are already showing each other more love than usual. \"You see a person without a mask by the roadside and someone will be giving him a helping hand. Before, they wouldn't have even looked at that guy,\" he says. \"This struggle is not between an Asian and an American, an American and a European, or a European and an African. \"Humans are up against something (coronavirus) we can't even see. If all we come together, as this song asks, we'll get through it.\" 4. Mulk Kay Nojawano (traditional) - chosen by Asfandyar from Power 99 in Islamabad, Pakistan Asfandyar's tricky task is to create \"positive content\" during the pandemic. His team have chosen to rework a traditional song, which he says gives people courage. \"It makes them feel like defenders. They're an army. Why? Because they're staying home, keeping themselves and their families safe.\" His playlists follow a daily rhythm. In the mornings, people want energetic pop to exercise to. By 5pm, it's time for something more reflective. \"That's when the sun sets, and we play songs like this to give them hope again for tomorrow. Music is the thing here which is calming people down.\" 5. Par Pira (BeePee) - chosen by Okeng from Radio King in Gulu, Uganda Lockdown has made radio more crucial than ever in rural northern Uganda. Okeng's breakfast show has a feel-good feature in which the station calls up two people who want to connect with each other but lack the means (pay-as-you-go phone credit) - and it's proving popular with couples. As well as dating each other via radio, Gulu's young lovers are said to be coping with their new separation by requesting an elegant Afro-fusion love song by local artist BeePee. \"The song means, 'have me in your heart during the good times, but also the bad times',\" Okeng explains. 6. Quarantine Show (Dubioza Kolektiv) - chosen by Naida from Radio Antena in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina Due to increased pressure on the internet, some of us are glad to just Skype a friend without having issues. But, miraculously, the seven members of Dubioza Kolektiv manage to use video-calling to jam out songs even while each musician stays at home. Radio Antena likes to play the best bits from these live sessions. \"Wash your hands!\" urges this eccentric (but informative) tune. Antena's mostly English-language playlist rarely gets more Balkan than the odd Dua Lipa track. But presenter Naida says the coronavirus has raised demand for Bosnian artists. \"People are listening to us all over the world. A lot of people left here during the [1992-95] war. Right now, they're missing home. They want to hear their language, and to know what's happening here.\" 7. Resistiré 2020 (David Bisbal, Vanesa Martín, Alex Ubago, and others) - chosen by Valeria from Metropolis FM in Montevideo, Uruguay Recorded back in 1988, Resistiré has re-emerged as a defiant hymn, belted out from apartment balconies in virus-hit Spain. \"It's different to a song like [Gloria Gaynor's] I Will Survive,\" says Valeria at Metropolis FM. \"It's not about saying, 'I made it'. Instead it's about saying, 'I will fight this'.\" A star-studded 2020 cover version has become her most requested song. Uruguay has not yet been badly hit by Covid-19, Valeria says, but people here are watching the rest of the world anxiously. \"A lot of them have relatives in Spain. Or they're terribly worried about family in the United States.\" 8. Ride Natty Ride (Bob Marley) - chosen by Maya from Capital Radio in Khartoum, Sudan \"The stone that the builder refuse / Shall be the head cornerstone.\" Maya loves these Bob Marley lyrics. She thinks they mean that every underdog will have its day. Protesters calling for political changes in Sudan in 2019 adopted the reggae icon as something of a \"freedom symbol\", and he remains popular with young artists and activists a year later. Many Sudanese continue to feel marginalised, Maya says. But now it's as a result of coronavirus restrictions, which could hit the country's poorest. So, she keeps playing Marley, \"no longer as a revolutionary voice, but as a calming father figure who says, 'you're going to get through this'\". 9. We Will Rock You (Queen) - chosen by Moustafa from Radio One in Baghdad, Iraq \"It's our anthem,\" says Moustafa of this 70s floor-stomper. \"Any time we face a challenge at the radio station, we have a saying: 'We will rock this; this is not a problem for us.' And the same thing goes for the listeners. Whenever they're feeling down, they always request We Will Rock You.\" For Moustafa, lockdown is further proof of how radio offers young Iraqis an escape from their daily struggles. Turns out it's therapeutic for the DJ, too. \"Just as listeners tell me their problems, I tell them mine. So, it's back and forth, which is awesome.\" 10. Rumah Kita (God Bless) - chosen by Hisa from Smart FM in Jakarta, Indonesia Translated as Our Home, this karaoke-ready tune has taken on a new meaning at Jakarta's Smart FM. Presenter Hisa is playing it for people who are ignoring social distancing restrictions. \"We want to invite them to stay at home and be observant of the rules,\" she explains. \"The song's message is all about how great Indonesia is: no matter where you go in the world, it's always more comfortable here. And, right now, it's best to stay not just in Indonesia, but in our homes.\" No official video available.", "summary": "Alors que près de la moitié de la population mondiale vit sous le coup de règles de distanciation sociale, beaucoup d'entre nous se tournent vers leurs chansons préférées pour se réconforter.

That has posed problems for those whose job it is to respond to our lifestyle needs and cater to our needs as consumers. All of a sudden, some formerly best-selling products are not so in demand any more, while others have become newly sought-after. The people at John Lewis are used to tracking such changes. Every year at about this time, they produce a report dissecting current trends, entitled How We Shop, Live and Look. And as they put it: \"In a year when we couldn't go out into the world, we brought the world into our homes.\" So what are the main ways in which that happened? Our homes really became our castles Once we had no choice but to sit and look at our four walls, many people didn't like what they saw. Some, of course, took the radical step of selling up and moving somewhere else. But others decided they could make better use of what they already had. \"As the year has progressed, we're more in love than ever with our homes, treating them to a facelift,\" John Lewis said in its report. The store chain said it had nearly 10,000 home design appointments with customers this year, both virtually and in-store. At the same time, sales of ready-made curtains rose 19% and sales of paint went up 33%. Hot tubs and gourmet barbecues were also big-selling accoutrements. We went casual, smart or otherwise With no need for power suits or formal office wear, people dressed down with a vengeance. That's not quite how John Lewis puts it, of course. Their report prefers to celebrate how we \"freed ourselves from the tyranny of the waistband\" and became comfortable with casual attire. \"With many of us working from home, sales of loungewear and leggings rose by 1,303%,\" the store says. But although we managed to spend some time outdoors after the first lockdown eased, sartorial standards remained relaxed. And dressing up to go out isn't making a comeback any time soon: sales of high-heeled shoes and party handbags are down 62% and 56% respectively. We changed our routines Instead of rushing out of the front door to begin the daily commute to work, we had the chance to ease into the working day before firing up the laptop at the dining-room table. That meant alarm clock purchases fell 38%, but espresso makers saw a 12% sales rise. Suitcase sales fell 69%: after all, we couldn't go anywhere. And while the local gym was off limits, home workout accessories such as fitness trackers and smart watches rose in popularity, notching up sales growth of 64%. We did more online shopping In common with many other retailers, John Lewis has seen a big increase in the proportion of its sales that take place online. Online now accounts for 60% to 70% of John Lewis sales, whereas before the pandemic it was only 40%. Peak times for customers shopping on the web have also changed, the chain says. People used to browse in the evening after work, but are now shopping more during the working day, particularly between the hours of 11:00 and 16:00.", "summary": "Que vous regardiez en arrière avec colère ou avec joie à la fin de cette année extraordinaire, il ne fait aucun doute que la pandémie de coronavirus a profondément changé notre façon de vivre."}

On Saturday, he was beatified at a ceremony in the town of Assisi and moved one step closer to sainthood. The teenager recorded purported miracles online and helped run websites for Catholic organisations. Acutis was placed on the path to sainthood after the Vatican ruled he had miraculously saved another boy's life. The Church claimed he interceded from heaven in 2013 to cure a Brazilian boy who was suffering from a rare pancreatic disease. He is believed to be the youngest contemporary person to be beatified - the last stage before sainthood. A ceremony was held in the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi on Saturday and a portrait of Acutis was unveiled. Those gathered also praised Acutis for his charity work. \"Carlo used the internet in service of the Gospel, to reach as many people as possible,\" Cardinal Agostino Vallini said at the ceremony. \"Young people might have been tired of a pastoral ministry that's maybe a bit out of step with the times despite all its efforts,\" Church spokesman Enzo Fortunato said, according to the AFP news agency. \"But the Lord intervenes in history and human affairs and gives us these guiding lights,\" he added. For Acutis to become a saint, the Vatican would have to verify a second miracle in his name. But Pope Francis has waived this requirement on previous occasions. Acutis was born in London in May 1991 to Italian parents. The family soon moved to Milan, and he spent the majority of his life in the city. \"There was in him a natural predisposition for the sacred,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper earlier this year. The teenager had a passion for computers and reportedly taught himself to code at a young age. \"He was considered a computer genius,\" Ms Salzano said in an interview with Vatican News. \"But what did he do? He didn't use [computers] to chat or have fun.\" Instead, Acutis took care of websites for local Catholic organisations and also created some of his own. But he was said to be conscious of the dangers of technology, something referenced by Pope Francis when he spoke about the teenager last year. \"[Acutis] saw that many young people, wanting to be different, really end up being like everyone else, running after whatever the powerful set before them with the mechanisms of consumerism and distraction,\" the Pope said. The teenager was also involved in charity work and spent his own money on helping disadvantaged people in his local area. He also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Milan. \"With his savings, he bought sleeping bags for homeless people and in the evening he brought them hot drinks,\" his mother told the Catholic News Agency. How does someone become a saint? There are a few steps required on the path to sainthood in the Catholic Church. 1) Wait a while The process to make someone a saint cannot normally start until at least five years after their death. But this waiting period can, in some circumstances, be waived by the Pope. 2) Become a 'servant of God' An investigation can then be opened to see whether the person lived their life with sufficient holiness. Evidence is gathered, and if the case is accepted the individual is called a \"servant of God\". 3) Show proof of 'heroic virtue' The department that makes recommendations to the Pope on saints scrutinises the evidence. If the case is approved, it is passed to the Pope who decides whether the person lived a life of \"heroic virtue\". If so, they can be called \"venerable\". 4) Verify a miracle The next stage, beatification, requires a miracle to be attributed to prayers made to the individual after their death. Incidents need to be \"verified\" by evidence before they are accepted. After beatification, the candidate is given the title \"blessed\". 5) Canonisation This is the final step in declaring a deceased person a saint. To reach this stage, a second miracle normally needs to be attributed to the individual.", "summary": "Un adolescent italien qui a utilisé Internet pour répandre sa foi pourrait devenir le premier saint de l'Église catholique à appartenir à la génération des Millenials."}

These are presidential directives that don't require congressional approval. Top of the list are rescinding a controversial travel ban, imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump against countries he viewed as a security threat, and rejoining the Paris climate deal. Here's what else we know about what will demand the new president's immediate attention. Coronavirus pandemic relief Masking up America The coronavirus has killed more than 400,000 people in the US - and the pandemic and its wide-ranging impact will be the new administration's top priority. Mr Biden has called it \"one of the most important battles our administration will face\" and has vowed to implement his Covid strategy straight away. One of his first moves will be executive action requiring social distancing and the wearing of masks on federal property nationwide and by federal employees and contractors. Still, there's no guarantee the state governors who've so far opposed mask mandates will suddenly change their minds - there appears to be no legal authority that grants a president the power to bring in a nationwide mask rule. Mr Biden seems to have conceded that point, and says he'll personally try to persuade governors to come around. If they're not receptive, he's vowed to make calls to mayors and municipal officials to recruit them to the cause. There's also no word yet on how a mandate will be enforced. 100 million vaccine doses in 100 days Mr Biden wants to speed up the vaccine rollout with the ultimate goal of vaccinating 100 million people with at least a first dose against Covid in his first 100 days in office. One part of the acceleration plan is to release all available vaccine doses instead of holding some in reserve for the necessary second jab. He is also expected to take executive action on efforts to develop and deploy rapid testing and to put in place a national supply chain for equipment, medications and personal protective equipment, or PPE. Rejoining WHO On his agenda is a pledge to reverse the decision to have the US leave the World Health Organization (WHO). Mr Trump announced plans over the summer to pull the country out of the WHO, accusing it of mismanaging Covid after the virus emerged in China and saying it failed to make \"greatly needed reforms\". Economic measures Relief for renters and homeowners Mr Biden's team has said he has immediate plans to extend a moratorium on evictions and on foreclosures on home mortgages - both of which were paused early in the pandemic - as well as the current pause on federal student loan payments and interest. Mr Biden's transition team said he plans to direct Cabinet agencies this week to \"take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families\", though they did not offer more detail. $1.9tn for the US coronavirus economy Last week, Mr Biden announced a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy, saying that \"a crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste\". If passed by Congress, it would include direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans. He has also included funding to help schools safely reopen, which he wants to happen in the first 100 days. It'll be in addition to a long-awaited $900bn stimulus package Congress passed in December, which Mr Biden had called a \"down payment\" on the larger proposed package. Republicans lawmakers are likely to object to parts of the bill, which will add more debt to what the US has already spent dealing with the pandemic - and Mr Biden will need bipartisan support for the plan. Democrats currently control both chambers of Congress, but only by narrow margins. Ending Trump tax cuts Covid aid isn't the only priority on the incoming president's economic agenda. He has pledged to get rid of Mr Trump's signature tax cuts as soon as he takes office. Mr Trump passed the cuts in 2017, early in his presidency, and the Biden team says they unfairly reward the wealthiest Americans and favour corporations over small businesses. Mr Biden has also said he would swiftly double the taxes that US firms pay on foreign profits - part of his Made in America push - which would come in addition to a rise in corporate taxes. His tax policy legislation will need to pass Congress. Environment and climate change Back in the Paris Agreement Another move Mr Biden says he will make on his first day in office is to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, a global accord that includes the goal to keep temperatures below 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and \"endeavour to limit\" them even more, to 1.5C. His predecessor pulled the US out of the 2015 accord - it became official on 4 November - making it the first nation in the world to do so. The US will officially be part of the agreement again within 30 days. Mr Biden has also pledged to \"up the ante\" and aim for higher standards on climate mitigation measures, and to convene a climate world summit within the first 100 days in office. Mr Biden has said he wants to work with Congress to enact legislation this year that will allow the US to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Cancelling Keystone XL pipeline In a move that has already sparked alarm with his northern neighbours, Mr Biden is reportedly planning to immediately rescind the cross-border permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, a planned project from the oil sands of Canada's Alberta province, through Montana and South Dakota, to rejoin an existing pipeline to Texas. Roll back deregulations A further agenda item is a U-turn on much of Mr Trump's legacy of climate and energy deregulation, like the easing of vehicle emissions targets. Mr Biden has said he will negotiate \"rigorous\" new emissions limits on cars and heavy-duty vehicles, to conserve 30% of US lands and waters by 2030, to ban new drilling on public lands, and to close the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The new administration says it plans also to bring in \"aggressive\" methane pollution limits for oil and gas operations and to ban new oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters. Immigration Policy Scrapping the travel ban The travel ban, signed by Mr Trump just seven days after taking office in January 2017, will be among the first policies to be discarded. The ban initially excluded people from seven majority-Muslim countries, but the list was modified following a series of court challenges. It now restricts citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea. A pathway to citizenship In another major immigration pledge, Mr Biden has said he'll swiftly send a bill to Congress laying out a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented immigrants. \"And all of those so-called dreamers, those Daca [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme] kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship,\" he said in late October. Late in the election, the campaign announced Mr Biden would create a task force to reunite some 545 migrant children separated from their parents at the US southern border. In December, the Biden team conceded it would need more time to roll back one of Mr Trump's policies, the Migrant Protection Protocols that force thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for US immigration court hearings. Once a \"Day One\" pledge, officials now say it could take about six months to address. Ending border wall construction Mr Biden has vowed to halt construction of a project synonymous with Mr Trump's presidency - the border wall between the US and Mexico. His campaign had called it \"a waste of money\" that \"diverts critical resources away from the real threats\". The administration says it will instead divert the federal funds towards efforts like new border screening measures. Race and criminal justice reforms The national reckoning with race is the fourth crisis - alongside Covid, the economy and climate - Mr Biden says he must tackle quickly. Some of those policies - like addressing racial disparities in housing and healthcare - overlap with his other plans. Mr Biden will sign an executive order on racial equality and call on all US agencies to create a plan to tackle any unequal barriers to opportunity. It will also rescind Mr Trump's executive order limiting the ability of federal government agencies to implement diversity and inclusion training. Mr Biden has promised to set up a national police oversight body to assist in reforming police departments in his first 100 days in office, though details of that plan are scarce. He has said he wants swift passage by Congress of the \"Safe Justice Act\", which includes measures on reforming mandatory minimum sentences and increasing funding for community based policing. LGBT protections He has made commitments to the LGBT community as well, like directing resources towards helping prevent violence against transgender people, ending the ban on transgender people serving in the military, and restoring guidance for transgender students in schools. One other priority is passing the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to existing federal civil rights laws, though how fast he can pass that legislation remains unclear. Reassuring US allies The incoming president says he plans to quickly reach out to US allies to smooth ruffled feathers and promise that \"America has your back\", saying the US must \"prove to the world that [it] is prepared to lead again - not just with the example of our power but also with the power of our example\". He has said on his first day in the Oval Office he would reach out to Nato allies with the message \"we're back and you can count on us again\". Though Mr Trump was not the first president to pressure other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation members to spend more on defence, he threatened at times to withdraw from the alliance that Mr Biden has called the \"bulwark of the liberal democratic ideal\".", "summary": "Joe Biden a passé 50 ans en politique pour atteindre ce moment, mais il n'aurait jamais pu s'attendre à ce que des défis aussi importants se présentent à lui dès son premier jour aux commandes.

Atmospheric measurements published in 2018 pointed to illegal CFC production that was occurring in Eastern China. Stopping that production appears to have set the ozone layer's healing process back on track. The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. When it is depleted, more of this UV radiation can reach the surface - causing potential harm to humans and other living things. Ultraviolet rays can damage DNA and cause sunburn, increasing the long-term risk of problems such as skin cancer. CFCs stand for chlorofluorocarbons. This family of chemicals has seen widespread use in refrigeration and as propellants in aerosol cans. Their role in destroying the ozone layer has been known since the 1980s. The conclusions of a chemistry-based detective story, based on work carried out over several years by an international team of researchers, are published in two papers in the journal Nature. The first paper reveals that global emissions - of one particular type of CFC, trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) - decreased in 2019 at a rate that is consistent with the global ban on CFC production. That ban was put in place by the 1987 Montreal Protocol - an environmental treaty signed by almost every country that banned the production of these ozone-depleting chemicals from 2010. \"Things seemed to be going to plan,\" explained Dr Luke Western, an atmospheric scientist from the University of Bristol. But in 2018, a study revealed that \"the concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere wasn't falling as quickly as we would expect\". \"That's where it all started - we wanted to know what was happening,\" said Dr Western. \"The work I was involved in showed that this [extra CFC-11] was primarily coming from East China.\" Dr Western and his colleagues used data from air monitoring stations in South Korea and Japan. Further detective work in China by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) - and by environmental journalists - found that the chemical was being used in the majority of polyurethane insulation foam that was being produced by firms in the region. The scientists stressed that the scale of this illegal production may never be revealed in full.

The director of Africa CDC, Dr John Nkengasong, said it was a \"sign of hope\". Africa has recorded 1,147,369 cases, more than half of which are in South Africa, and about 26,000 deaths. Dr Nkengasong said he was hopeful \"that we are beginning to bend the curve slowly\" but added that \"it's very, very early - we are dealing with a very delicate virus that spreads rapidly\". \"We take this news with cautious optimism,\" he said, explaining that he didn't want people to get complacent and stop trying to prevent the spread of the virus. \"We really want our population not to show what we call 'prevention fatigue', where we slow down on the measures that we are putting in place.\" He urged people to continue their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus, specifically saying that people needed to continue to wear masks, to maintain social distance and that more testing is needed. Should Africa be celebrating? Anne Soy, BBC News, Nairobi After a sustained rise in the number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, the week-on-week drop is a welcome relief. But the trend must be noted with a lot of caution. Testing has increased steadily in the past few months to more than 10 million tests conducted so far, according to the Africa CDC. That's nearly 1% of the continent's population. But it's still a mixed bag - South Africa leads in both the number of tests conducted and positive cases. The WHO attributes the overall drop in newly confirmed cases in Africa to the decreasing number of positive cases observed in the country in recent days. But lower testing rates in much of the continent means we are still not getting the true picture of the pandemic. It may well be too soon to predict a sustained downward trend of newly confirmed cases in Africa. Dr Nkengasong also said that more than 10 million tests had been conducted across the continent, with South Africa being one of the main countries to test people. Recorded cases and deaths are relatively low compared to other parts of the word such as parts of Europe, Latin America and the US, which alone has more than 5,500,000 cases, but some experts warn that there may be many more cases than are recorded in Africa because of the lack of testing. The spread of the virus appeared to be relatively slow in Africa in the early stages of the pandemic but the recorded rate of infection gradually accelerated, especially in South Africa. More about coronavirus in Africa: South Africa has 596,060 cases of coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That is more than half the cases across Africa and the fifth-most cases in the world. The country's cases have been falling, and this has been driving the fall in cases across the continent. At its peak, there were more than 12,000 daily confirmed new cases and that has fallen to an average of 5,000. The next African country to feature on the list is Egypt, in 31st place in the world with 96,914 cases.", "summary": "Les cas quotidiens moyens de coronavirus en Afrique ont diminué la semaine dernière, selon le Centre africain pour le contrôle et la prévention des maladies (CDC Afrique)."}

Sources told the BBC she was in fear for her life as she prepared for the court battle with her husband. She is said to be hiding in a townhouse in central London. She was conspicuously absent from Royal Ascot this year, despite being an Olympic rider and a regular at races. Growing up Princess Haya was born in May 1974. Her father was King Hussein of Jordan, and her mother was Queen Alia al-Hussein. She was just three years old when her mother was killed in a helicopter crash in the south of the country. The current ruler of Jordan, King Abdullah II, is her half-brother. The princess spent a lot of time in the UK as a child. She was educated at two private schools, Badminton School in Bristol and Bryanston School in Dorset, before studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University. She has previously told interviewers that she has a passion for falconry, shooting and heavy machinery, and she claims to be the only woman licensed to drive heavy trucks in Jordan. She took up horse riding as a young girl and found a passion for the sport, and in her 20s she pursued a career as a full-time professional equestrian athlete. The highlight of her riding career came when she represented Jordan in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and was her country's flag bearer. 'I am lucky to be close to him' On 10 April 2004, aged 30, Princess Haya married Sheikh Mohammed - the vice president and prime minister of the UAE, and the ruler of Dubai. He was 53 at the time, and Princess Haya was his sixth and \"junior\" wife. He reportedly has 23 children by his different wives. Like her, he was keen on horses: he was the founder and owner of Godolphin horse-racing stables. The couple were wed in a ceremony in Amman. In the years since, Princess Haya has spoken effusively in public about her relationship with Sheikh Mohammed, painting a picture of perfect family life. \"Every day I am amazed by the things he does,\" she told Emirates Woman magazine in 2016. \"Every single day I thank god that I am lucky enough to be close to him.\" But cracks appeared to show last year when Sheikha Latifa, one of Sheikh Mohammed's daughters, tried to flee the country. In a video that spread worldwide, the 33-year-old princess claimed she and her family \"did not have freedom of choice\" in their lives, and that she had been subjected to abuse. Sheikha Latifa reportedly escaped the UAE by sea with the help of a Frenchman, but was intercepted by armed men off the coast of India and returned to Dubai. In December, photos were released of her sitting next to the former Irish president Mary Robinson at home in the emirate. The authorities in Dubai insisted Sheikha Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe in Dubai\". At the time, Princess Haya echoed the statement, saying it was \"unimaginable that this thing has gone so far from the truth\". But now, just over six months later, sources close to Princess Haya told the BBC that she had discovered disturbing facts about Sheikha Latifa's attempt to flee and been subjected to increasing hostility and pressure from members of her husband's extended family. She reportedly no longer felt safe, and fled to Germany before moving on to the UK with her children. She has now applied for a forced marriage protection order and a non-molestation order in the UK High Court in London - as well as wardship of her children. Her husband has not responded formally to reports about their marriage. He did post on Instagram on 10 June, accusing an unidentified woman of \"treachery and betrayal\". In court, he has asked for his children to be returned to Dubai.

Alexievich called the award, presented to a living writer and worth 8m kronor (£691,000), \"a great personal joy.\" Previous winners include literary heavyweights Rudyard Kipling and Ernest Hemingway. French novelist Patrick Modiano won in 2014. It has been half a century since a writer working primarily in non-fiction won the Nobel - and Alexievich is the first journalist to win the award. \"It's not an award for me but for our culture, for our small country, which has been caught in a grinder throughout history,\" she said at a press conference on Thursday at a local newspaper's offices in Minsk, Belarus. Living in exile Her best-known works in English translation include Voices from Chernobyl, an oral history of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe; and Zinky Boys, a collection of first-hand accounts from the Soviet-Afghan war. The title refers to the zinc coffins in which the dead came home. The book caused controversy and outrage when it was first published in Russia, where reviewers called it a \"slanderous piece of fantasy\" and part of a \"hysterical chorus of malign attacks\". Alexievich has also been critical of her home country's government, leading to a period of persecution - in which her telephone was bugged and she was banned from making public appearances. She spent 10 years in exile from 2000, living in Italy, France, Germany and Sweden, among other places, before moving back to Minsk. \"I love the Russian world, but the kind, humane Russian world,\" she added, talking of the country under President Vladimir Putin. \"I do not love Beria, Stalin, Putin... how low they let Russia sink.\" Belarusian and Russian reaction to Alexievich prize Svetlana Alexievich: Exposing stark Soviet realities The author was born in 1948 in the Ukrainian town of Ivano-Frankivsk, then known as Stanislav,to a Belarusian father and Ukrainian mother. The family moved to Belarus after her father completed his military service, and Alexievich studied journalism at the University of Minsk between 1967 and 1972. After graduation, she worked as a journalist for several years before publishing her first book, War's Unwomanly Face, in 1985. Based on interviews with hundreds of women who participated in the World War Two, it set a template for her future works, constructing narratives from witnesses to some the world's most devastating events. On her personal website, Alexievich explains her pursuit of journalism: \"I chose a genre where human voices speak for themselves.\" Alexievich has previously won the Swedish PEN prize for her \"courage and dignity as a writer\". Ms Danius said the author had spent nearly 40 years studying the people of the former Soviet Union, but that her work was not only about history but \"something eternal, a glimpse of eternity\". \"By means of her extraordinary method - a carefully composed collage of human voices - Alexievich deepens our comprehension of an entire era,\" the Swedish Academy added. Alexievich was the bookmakers' favourite to win 2015 Nobel award, according to Ladbrokes. She beat other hot favourites Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami and Kenyan novelist Ngugi Wa Thiong'o.

Here's what we learned. 1. Netflix is making a lot of money The company now has more than 200 million paid members, up more than 30% from 2019. About 37 million people subscribed last year, including 8.5 million in the last three months alone. The additions - as well as price increases in the US, UK and elsewhere - helped revenue rise 24% in the most recent quarter to $6.6bn (£4.8bn), while profit hit $542m. For the year, it reported nearly $25bn in revenue and almost $2.8bn in profit. Netflix, which has taken on major debt to fuel its expansion, said the gains meant it expects to be able to stop borrowing to finance its operations and is considering using excess cash to buy back shares. The disclosures helped the firm's shares shoot up more than 9% in after-hours trade on Tuesday. 2. Non-Anglophone shows have been a hit More than 80% of the new sign-ups last year came from outside the US and Canada, with Europe counting for the most new members. And Netflix shows are increasingly breaking national barriers. For example, Netflix said that the French-language show Lupin, about a gentleman burglar, had shot to the number one spot in Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Spain and others - while ranking second on its top 10 list in the US. The firm expects 70 million households to watch the show in its first 28 days. 3. There might be a new season of Bridgerton The success of Lupin and other titles from the firm, such as Bridgerton, Tiger King and Money Heist, is a sign of the extent to which Netflix - which once relied on movies and shows made by other companies - has become a major force in film-making and television. The firm, which pioneered streaming back in 2007, has over 500 titles in post-production or preparing to launch and has said it plans to release at least one original film every week in 2021. In its investor note, the firm said it had \"exciting news\" to come this week about Bridgerton, stirring speculation that could include a new season of the popular costume drama. 4. It has one eye on the competition The bonanza of new material is core to Netflix's strategy of maintaining its lead as other companies, such as Disney, Viacom, HBO and others, put more effort into their streaming offerings. Indeed, one host on US financial broadcaster CNBC joked that the firm's hint about Bridgerton was the biggest revelation of the report. \"The big growth in streaming entertainment has led legacy competitors... to compete with us in new ways, which we've been expecting for many years,\" Netflix said in its investor note. \"This is, in part, why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a wide range of genres and nations.\" Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight, said an \"intense battle\" lies ahead between Netflix and other firms. \"Netflix has far more to lose given its huge base while rivals are only starting to get going. Originals will be a key differentiator,\" he said. \"There will be casualties. Viewers will have to make tough choices as they can't afford all of the streaming services including those for music and games.\"", "summary": "Netflix a reçu un grand coup de pouce l'année dernière avec la pandémie, car la demande de films et de télévision en streaming a grimpé en flèche."}

But others are less gloomy about AI's prospects. The theoretical physicist, who has the motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is using a new system developed by Intel to speak. Machine learning experts from the British company Swiftkey were also involved in its creation. Their technology, already employed as a smartphone keyboard app, learns how the professor thinks and suggests the words he might want to use next. Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans. \"It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate,\" he said. \"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.\" But others are less pessimistic. \"I believe we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised,\" said Rollo Carpenter, creator of Cleverbot. Cleverbot's software learns from its past conversations, and has gained high scores in the Turing test, fooling a high proportion of people into believing they are talking to a human. Rise of the robots Mr Carpenter says we are a long way from having the computing power or developing the algorithms needed to achieve full artificial intelligence, but believes it will come in the next few decades. \"We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it,\" he says. But he is betting that AI is going to be a positive force. Prof Hawking is not alone in fearing for the future. In the short term, there are concerns that clever machines capable of undertaking tasks done by humans until now will swiftly destroy millions of jobs. In the longer term, the technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is \"our biggest existential threat\". Robotic voice In his BBC interview, Prof Hawking also talks of the benefits and dangers of the internet. He quotes the director of GCHQ's warning about the net becoming the command centre for terrorists: \"More must be done by the internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy.\" He has, however, been an enthusiastic early adopter of all kinds of communication technologies and is looking forward to being able to write much faster with his new system. But one aspect of his own tech - his computer generated voice - has not changed in the latest update. Prof Hawking concedes that it's slightly robotic, but insists he didn't want a more natural voice. \"It has become my trademark, and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent,\" he said. \"I'm told that children who need a computer voice, want one like mine.\"", "summary": "De Stephen Hawking à Elon Musk, certains des plus grands esprits du monde dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle s'inquiètent du fait que l'IA représente une menace existentielle pour notre espèce."}

After the accident, their parents fought a protracted legal battle to be allowed to use the embryos. The boy was born in December to a surrogate from Laos and The Beijing News first reported the case this week. The newspaper explained how the lack of precedent for a case of this kind had forced the deceased couple's parents through a legal minefield before the surrogacy could proceed. No precedent At the time of the accident, the embryos were stored safely in a Nanjing hospital, frozen at minus 196 degrees in a liquid nitrogen tank. A court battle gave the four grandparents-to-be the right over the fertilised eggs. There was no precedent as to whether they could inherit their children's frozen embryos, according to reports. They were eventually granted the embryos, but it wasn't long until the next problem occurred. The embryos could only be taken from the Nanjing hospital if there was proof that another hospital would store them. But given the legal uncertainty around untransplanted embryos, it was hard to find another medical institution in China willing to get involved. And with surrogacy illegal in China, the only realistic option was to look beyond the country's borders. Proving paternity and nationality Eventually, the future grandparents worked with a surrogacy agency and decided on Laos, where commercial surrogacy was legal. As no airline was willing to accept a thermos-sized bottle of liquid nitrogen, the precious cargo had to be transported by car. In Laos, the embryo was implanted into the womb of the surrogate mother and in December 2017 the boy was born. Citizenship of the child, named Tiantian, was another problem though and so he was born not in Laos but in China - with the surrogate travelling there on a simple tourist visa. With no parents left to prove paternity, all four grandparents had to give blood and take DNA tests to establish that the baby was indeed their grandson and that both parents had been Chinese nationals.", "summary": "Un bébé est né en Chine d'une mère porteuse quatre ans après la mort de ses parents dans un accident de voiture."}

Uber China launched in 2014 but has failed to make any profit so far. Cheng Wei, founder and chief executive of Didi Chuxing, said the two companies had \"learned a great deal from each other over the past two years in China's burgeoning new economy\". He added that the deal would \"set the mobile transportation industry on a healthier, more sustainable path of growth at a higher level\". As part of the deal, Mr Cheng will join the board of Uber, while Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick will join Didi's board. Uber's China business will retain its separate branding while US-based Uber Technologies will hold a stake of about 17.5% in the combined company. Didi Chuxing is backed by Chinese internet giants Tencent and Alibaba, and has also invested in Uber's rival US taxi-booking service Lyft. Big losses Uber has been struggling to break into the Chinese market despite having Chinese search engine Baidu as an investor. In February, the company admitted it was losing more than $1bn a year in China, spending huge sums to subsidise discounted fares. \"Funding their China dreams was becoming too expensive for Uber,\" Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based consultancy BDA, told the BBC. \"Many saw it as an obstacle to their own IPO (Initial Public Offering).\" Uber chief Travis Kalanick said that \"as an entrepreneur, I've learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart\". \"Getting to profitability is the only way to build a sustainable business that can best serve Chinese riders, drivers and cities over the long term.\" The fierce rivalry had led both companies to heavily subsidise their journeys. The merger is likely to see fewer such subsidies. \"One thing to watch carefully is how quickly consumers feel the impact as subsidies are withdrawn,\" Mr Clark added. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent If you can't beat them, join them - that may be what Uber's ultra ambitious Travis Kalanick was thinking. This deal may be Uber's best available option on the table. Uber put up a good fight, there's no doubt about it. And it may not all be bad news. If the departure from the Chinese market means a sizeable stake in the biggest ride-sharing player in the world's second largest economy, which currently has a potential customer base of some 750 million people, and that's only going to grow - then that's not too shabby.

Millions with conditions like depression, anxiety and schizophrenia struggle to get treatment due to lack of resources and the stigmatisation of mental health problems. Pregnant women are a particularly at-risk group. In Kenya, for example, symptoms of depression such as fatigue and sleep problems are sometimes dismissed as purely symptoms of pregnancy, or even blamed on witchcraft. This lack of medical attention, combined with high rates of domestic violence contributed to a 0.5% maternal mortality rate in 2015, one of the highest in the world. Depression in pregnancy is also associated with low birth weight, maltreatment and problems breastfeeding. One million people without a psychiatrist Kenya has only two mental health professionals for every 100,000 people, and they are concentrated in urban areas. This means some rural counties have a population of millions, but no psychiatrists. An estimated 75% of people with mental health conditions in poorer countries can't access medical treatment. This means many to turn to non-specialist traditional healers, faith healers and community health workers instead. We discovered that training these groups to screen for mental health conditions could drastically reduce the number of people who can't access treatment. Building on these findings, traditional birth attendants were trained to screen for depression in more than 1,700 pregnant women in a pilot study by the Africa Mental Health Research and Training Foundation. The study took place in Makueni County, a largely rural part of south-eastern Kenya. One of the country's poorest counties, it has no resident psychologists. Who are traditional birth attendants? Domestic violence The results of the screening were striking. A quarter of the mothers in the study were found to have mild to moderate depression. Three-quarters had experienced intimate partner violence, whether physical, sexual or emotional abuse, or controlling behaviour. Half are victims of at least two forms of this violence. Nearly 60% of the mothers diagnosed with depression received treatment from their birth attendant based on a World Health Organization programme designed for use by non-specialists. The mothers were 26 years old on average, with almost half aged between 12 and 24. One young mother involved in the study, Ndanu*, was diagnosed with depression. She said: \"If it were not for this programme and the help of a birth attendant, I would not have kept this baby to term and perhaps not gone for all the antenatal visits. \"The birth attendant counselled me, encouraged me to keep the baby by telling me that it was not my fault and children are a blessing and that I should visit the health centre for antenatal care. She promised to check on me and opened her house for me to talk to her whenever I wanted\" Birth attendants intervened by talking through problems, involving supportive family members, and flagging any signs of mistreatment. They encouraged depressed mothers to exercise and maintain a regular sleep cycle, rebuild their social networks and resume activities which they'd previously enjoyed. The mothers were also given the opportunity to take part in community activities and join support groups. Mueni*, a birth attendant taking part in the study, said: \"A pregnant mother opens up to us and we try to understand the reasons for her depression, we solve the issues through guidance and counselling. If the issue is rooted on her parents or her spouse, we engage them and we reach an agreement.\" Mothers who received the treatment saw their depressive symptoms fall by 55% at the end of three months, compared to 26% of those who didn't have a specific intervention. More like this Discreet mental health services These early findings suggest training birth attendants in mental healthcare could improve the wellbeing of mothers and their children, not just in Kenya but in any countries where similar community health workers operate. Birth attendants are usually accessible and have a good relationship with their patients, meaning they are well placed to offer low-cost, discreet mental health services. Training up more psychiatrists would be helpful, but this takes a lot of time and funding. Birth attendants could bridge the gap by offering an accessible, acceptable level of basic mental health care in under-resourced areas, while still providing a link between healthcare professionals and pregnant mothers. *Names have been changed About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. \"Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection,\" said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. \"The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity.\" He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was \"very concerning\" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. \"Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. \"It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "Aux États-Unis, la double contamination au Covid 19 d'un homme, avec une seconde infection plus grave, soulève des questions sur le degré d'immunité face au virus et sa durée de vie."}

Meghan also said: \"If that comes with risk of losing things, I mean... there is a lot that has been lost already.\" Buckingham Palace is investigating claims the duchess bullied royal staff. The allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were published after the interview with Oprah was recorded. The interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on Sunday and in the UK on Monday, is expected to detail Harry and Meghan's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US. In the 30-second teaser clip released by CBS, Oprah asks the duchess: \"How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\" Meghan replies: \"I don't know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.\" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. A report in the Times newspaper on Wednesday claimed the duchess faced a complaint made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace after their marriage in May of that year. A leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff. In a statement later, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said it was \"clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times\" and its HR team would look into the circumstances outlined in the article. \"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\" The gloves have come off If anyone thought Prince Harry and Meghan were going to restrict their criticism to the British media, a sector they have made clear they loathe, they should think again. \"The Firm\" - aka the Royal Family and its staff - is clearly in their sights. This isn't directly about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan, and also to a lesser degree Harry. They were published after the interview was recorded. But the couple see the allegations as an example of how some people in the palace brief against them. We'll have to wait for the interview to find out exactly what \"falsehoods\" the couple believe have been put out by the palace. The bullying allegations - which are vigorously denied by the couple - are being investigated. But it's clear that the gloves have come off, and that the ties of family have not restrained the couple as they seek to put their side of the story. Past and present royal employees are to be invited to speak in confidence about their experiences of working for Meghan as part of the investigation. 'Attack on her character' The bullying allegations are denied by Meghan and Prince Harry. A statement issued by Meghan's spokesman in response to the newspaper's story said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. \"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\" Author Anna Pasternak - who wrote a book on Princess Diana - said she thought \"the whole issue stems to when Meghan first entered the Royal Family\". \"I think she was naïve, she didn't really understand the monarchy or 'The Firm' as she rightly puts it, and the constricts of royal power. She was naive to think that she could modernise the monarchy, that she could have her voice and could do things her way,\" she told Radio 5 Live. But Rachel C. Boyle, head of interdisciplinary studies at Leeds Beckett University, said the Oprah interview was \"absolutely the right thing to do at this point\". \"I feel like Meghan has not been given the opportunity to defend herself or to respond to any of the claims that have previously been made about her in the media, in a space that allows her to express herself.\" Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans. In an earlier clip released by CBS, the Duke of Sussex drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan. Just hours before the interview is aired in the US, a special programme to celebrate Commonwealth Day will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:00 on Sunday 7 March. It comes as Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of Edinburgh has undergone a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition and will be remaining in hospital for a number of days.", "summary": "La duchesse de Sussex affirme que le palais de Buckingham ne pouvait pas s'attendre à ce qu'elle et le prince Harry se taisent s'il \"perpétue des mensonges à notre sujet\"."}

On Wednesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he expected a solution \"in the coming weeks\". The virus is spreading in the US, so it is likely Americans would be barred. The 27-member bloc must first agree the measures that non-EU countries should meet before deciding on a safe list. Brazil, Russia and other countries with high infection rates would also be left off a safe list, according to reports from Brussels. The EU is not yet thought to have agreed how they will assess which countries meet health standards - one of the criteria for entry. Part of the problem is assessing reliable health data, reports say. What did Pompeo say? Travel has largely been banned between the US and EU during the pandemic, but Mr Pompeo said he was \"very confident\" a solution could be found. \"We certainly don't want to reopen in a way that jeopardises the United States from people travelling here and we certainly don't want to cause problems anyplace else,\" he said. He did not give details, but added that the US was working \"to get the global travel back in place\". Comparing infection rates with other countries Latest figures from the EU's health agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, highlight Brazil, Peru, Chile, Panama and Saudi Arabia as countries with the highest \"case notification rate\". Russia and the US have a lower rate of cases per 100,000 inhabitants but are still higher than most of Europe. The US has seen 2.3 million infections and 120,000 deaths and cases are climbing in several states. The European Commission is advising ambassadors only to consider countries that are comparable or better than the EU average when it comes to new infections, the trend in new infections, as well as testing and tracing. Reports said member states were assessing two different lists. The Politico website said one covered countries with fewer than 16 cases per 100,000 people and the other with up to 20 cases, which would include Canada and Turkey. The New York Times said the list would be revised every two weeks, so the US could be added later. Other criteria also being considered are reciprocity and links to the EU. France wants the EU to give access only when it is reciprocated by other countries, while Spain is said to be keen to reopen the border with neighbouring Morocco. Earlier this month the European Commission also stressed that reopening borders with non-EU states in the Western Balkans was a priority from 1 July. However, EU member Croatia announced on Wednesday that travellers from Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia would all face 14-day self-isolation from the end of the day, because of an increase in infections. The US may also be a problem diplomatically, as on 14 March President Donald Trump unilaterally closed US borders to countries in the EU's Schengen border-free zone. The EU condemned the move at the time. Why this is a fraught decision for EU countries Which countries' travellers are allowed in, and which are not? At first this may seem a practical decision for the EU: if a country outside the EU and Schengen area has high rates of infection, its citizens won't be allowed in to the bloc. If infection rates are similar to or lower than the EU average, then willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! Except it's not that simple. Producing a list of outside countries \"acceptable\" for EU travel is also a political - and economic - decision. Tourists bring much-needed revenue to Covid-19-ravaged economies, of course. But EU leaders are not keen to take risks. Even countries wanting an economic boost are aware the political backlash would be huge if tourists bring Covid-19 with them. And, as is so often the case, opinion between the EU's 27 countries is divided. Some worry that barring a particular country over Covid-19 could cause political friction with allies or worsen existing tensions. EU relations with Washington and with Moscow are already delicate, shall we say. Then there's the issue of reciprocity. France is particularly attached to this. In other words, if a country bars entry to tourists from an EU or Schengen nation, then that country should be allowed to return the \"favour\", thinks Paris. Also, if a non-EU country grants access to EU visitors, should the EU be diplomatically obliged to respond in kind? I'm told the list of outside countries whose citizens will have access to EU/Schengen as of 1 July is likely to be \"small\" to start with. Discussions between member states' ambassadors to Brussels are due to continue on Friday, with an outcome to be decided unanimously on Friday or \"shortly after\". Can Europe save its tourist season? The EU is split into two groups that include those hoping to salvage something from this year's summer tourist season and those that fear for the health situation. Although the EU urged the 27 member states to reopen internal borders from 15 June, several countries have moved carefully to avoid a second spike in infections. Denmark, which was among the first European countries to start lifting its lockdown, has begun reopening its borders more slowly than others. Denmark is a Schengen state but it still has strict criteria for those visiting the country. Tourists were allowed to return from mid-June from Norway, Iceland and Germany, but not from neighbouring Sweden. Greece, meanwhile, opened its borders to much of Europe on 15 June in a bid to kick-start its tourist season. Visitors from some countries including Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands face compulsory testing for Covid-19.", "summary": "Les ambassadeurs de l'UE se réunissent mercredi pour planifier la réouverture des frontières extérieures le 1er juillet.

Even then, she still had hope. But after selling her hair, she was faced with the prospect of having nothing more of value, no way to pay the creditors demanding their money, and no food in the cupboard. What happened next has inspired people across India. Drowning in debt Before his death, Prema and her husband had worked in a brick kiln in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, making just enough to scrape a living together for their young family. But they had hoped for more. Her husband took out a loan to start his own brick kiln, but the plans failed to take off. In a moment of desperation last year, he killed himself. The pressure fell solely on Prema to not only earn enough to feed, clothe and house herself and her three children, but also to pay back the money they owed for the failed business venture. And for a while she managed, taking her two youngest to work with her. \"When I go to work I get 200 rupees ($2.80) per day, which is enough to run our family,\" Prema explains to the BBC. But she became ill, which meant she couldn't earn as much. \"I couldn't carry a heavy load of bricks. I stayed home for most of the time due to a fever.\" She was sick for three months - by the end of which the bills had mounted, and the cupboards had run bare. \"My seven-year-old son Kaliyappan came back from school and asked for food,\" she recalls. \"Then he started crying due to hunger.\" Prema had no property, jewellery, valuables or kitchen utensils that could be exchanged for cash. \"I didn't even have a 10 rupee note [$0.14; £0.11] with me. I just had a few plastic buckets.\" Then she realised she did have something she could sell after all. \"I remembered a shop which used to buy hair,\" Prema says, thinking immediately of her own hair. India is one of the world's top exporters of human hair, which is sold around the globe to make extensions. Some Hindu devotees offer up their hair in temples when their prayers are answered. \"I went there and sold my entire head of hair for 150 rupees ($2; £1.50).\" It might not sound like a lot - the money she got might only have been able to buy a lunch at a restaurant in a large city - but in her village, Prema was able to buy much more. \"I got three packs of cooked rice, each costing 20 rupees, for my three children,\" she says. But the respite was only temporary: Prema knew she was out of options, and her thoughts began to turn towards more drastic measures. Desperation She went to a shop where she hoped to find something to end her life. But, seeing her state of distress and realising her plan, the shopkeeper refused to sell her anything. Prema went home and decided to find another way of taking her own life. She was saved by her sister, who lives in the neighbourhood and happened to come by in time to stop her. And then, just a few days later, the help she so desperately needed appeared out of the blue. Bala Murugan heard about Prema's situation from a friend who owned a local brick kiln. It immediately struck a nerve: her struggle reminded him of his family's darkest hour. Bala knows well how poverty can drive people to despair - at the age of 10, his family ran out of food. His mother sold their old books and newspapers by weight to buy rice. And then, in a state of utter despair, Bala's mother decided to kill herself and her children. She changed her mind at the last moment: the family rushed their mother to a doctor, and she was saved. Bala now lives a life a world away from the situation he grew up in. After years of struggle, he has worked his way out of poverty and now owns a computer graphics centre. And now, he had a chance to pay his own good fortune forward: Bala told Prema about his journey and encouraged her to find hope. Along with his friend, Prabhu, he gave her some money to buy food. Then Bala wrote about the family on social media. \"Within a day I got 120,000 rupees ($1,670). When I told Prema about it she was very happy and said that was enough to pay back most of her loan,\" he tells the BBC. But at Prema's request, the fundraising was stopped. \"She said she would get back to her work and pay the rest,\" Bala explains. She now has to pay back about 700 rupees a month - about $10 - to different creditors, while district officials have stepped in and promised to help her to set up a dealership selling milk. Prema is slowly getting back on her feet, but, sadly, her financial situation is far from unique. In spite of India's economic growth, millions like her struggle to put food on the table. According to the World Bank, India is home to the second largest number of people living in extreme poverty - classified as those earning less than $1.90 per day. Prema has another obstacle in her way: she cannot read or write, like tens of millions of other Indians. As a result, she is unaware of government schemes which provide help to people like her. Meanwhile, the country's formal banking system has complex rules that make it difficult for poor communities to access credit at low interest rates. Instead, Prema and her husband had borrowed from local money lenders and neighbours at higher rates - sending her spiralling further into debt. But thanks to her community's generosity, she is able to see a way out of the cycle of poverty which has kept her trapped. Bala Murugan, meanwhile, has assured the family of his continued support. \"Now I realise suicide was the wrong decision,\" she says. \"I am confident about paying back the rest of the loan.\" If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact at BBC Action Line.

{"source_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53917432", "target_url": "https://www.bbc.com/afrique/monde-53942290", "text": "By David ShukmanBBC News science editor For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. 1: If it's stuffy, walk away When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be \"airborne transmission\" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According to workplace regulations set up before the pandemic, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, says Dr Hywel Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: \"If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.\" 2: Look up at the air conditioning From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. A study of a restaurant in China blamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was \"pre-symptomatic\" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: \"If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any.\" 3: Ask about the 'fresh air ratio' In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. \"Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,\" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. \"The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building.\" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants. . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. 4: Get the office management to check if there's virus in the filters A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can \"show us where to punch and when to punch\" in tackling infections. 5: Watch out for draughts Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. \"If you open a window, where is the air going to go?\" he asks. \"We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. \"More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences.\" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.", "summary": "Une bonne ventilation pourrait être la clé pour éviter le coronavirus à l'approche de l'automne, alors que les gens passent plus de temps à l'intérieur."}

But the amendments, which must be put to a referendum within 30 days, would lengthen his current term to six years and allow him to stand for one more. They would also give Mr Sisi more power over the judiciary and further enshrine the military's role in politics. In 2013, Mr Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule. Since then, he has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people. Mr Sisi was first elected president in 2014 and was re-elected last year after winning 97% of the vote. He faced no serious competition because several potential rivals dropped out or were arrested. Parliament is also dominated by supporters of Mr Sisi and it has been criticised by the opposition as being a rubber stamp for the president. One MP who campaigned for the constitutional amendments, Mohammed Abu Hamed, told AFP news agency that Mr Sisi was a president who \"took important political, economic and security measures\" and who had to be allowed to \"continue with his reforms\" in the wake of the unrest in neighbouring Libya and Sudan. But Khaled Dawoud, of the liberal al-Dustour party, dismissed the argument as \"absurd\" and told the BBC that the changes represented a \"power-grab\" by Mr Sisi. The internet monitor NetBlocks said Egyptian authorities had partly or fully blocked 34,000 websites in an attempt to restrict access to a campaign website that had reportedly collected 250,000 signatures against the amendments. How could the president stay in power until 2030? Article 140 of Egypt's current constitution, which was approved in a referendum in 2014, currently says that the president serves four-year terms and may only be re-elected once. Under the changes approved by MPs on Tuesday, presidential terms would become six years. A transitional arrangement outlined in article 241 would extend Mr Sisi's current term by two years and allow him to stand for one additional six-year term in 2024. The president would also be permitted to appoint one or more vice-presidents. The post was removed following the adoption of the 2012 constitution. What about the role of the military? The military's economic and civilian activities have already expanded since Mr Sisi became president. It is in charge of major infrastructure projects, and generals occupy key positions throughout the government. Article 200 would be changed to say that, as well as protecting the country and preserving its security, the duty of the military is to \"preserve the constitution and democracy, maintain the basic pillars of the state and its civilian nature, and uphold the gains of the people, and the rights and freedoms of individuals\". The amendment to article 234 would meanwhile enshrine the role of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in approving the minister of defence's appointment. The article had been set to expire at the end of Mr Sisi's second term. How would the judiciary be affected? The amendments to articles 185, 189 and 193 would enshrine an executive body headed by Egypt's president to oversee the judiciary and allow the president to appoint the heads of key courts, including the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Constitutional Court, as well as the public prosecutor. Amnesty International has said this would undermine judicial independence. The amendment to article 190 would largely remove the authority of State Council judges to revise legislation before it becomes law. Article 204 would be changed to grant wider jurisdiction for military courts. They would be able to try civilians not only for attacks against military installations, factories, equipment, zones, borders and personnel, but also any building that is under the protection of the military. Thousands of civilians have been tried in military courts since 2011. Would parliament change too? New articles would re-establish an upper house, which was abolished in 2014. The president would appoint one-third of the 180 members of the new chamber, which would be known as the Senate. The rest would be directly elected. The number of seats in the lower house, the House of Representatives, would also be reduced from 596 to 450, with at least 25% reserved for women.", "summary": "Le Parlement égyptien a approuvé un changement constitutionnel qui permettrait au président Abdel Fattah al-Sissi de rester au pouvoir jusqu'en 2030."}

The cost of raising children in cities has deterred many Chinese couples. The latest move was approved by President Xi Jinping at a meeting of top Communist Party officials. It will come with \"supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources\", according to Xinhua news agency. But human rights organisation Amnesty International said the policy, like its predecessors, was still a violation of sexual and reproductive rights. \"Governments have no business regulating how many children people have. Rather than 'optimising' its birth policy, China should instead respect people's life choices and end any invasive and punitive controls over people's family planning decisions,\" said the group's China team head, Joshua Rosenzweig. Also, some experts were sceptical of the impact. \"If relaxing the birth policy was effective, the current two-child policy should have proven to be effective too,\" Hao Zhou, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told Reuters news agency. \"But who wants to have three kids? Young people could have two kids at most. The fundamental issue is living costs are too high and life pressures are too huge.\" On a rainy, bleak day in Beijing I was out buying a coffee when the news broke. People started looking down at their phones as they beeped and whirred with the headline flashing across their screens - China to allow couples to have three children. This is big news in a country which didn't start suddenly producing more babies when the one-child policy eased off to two. In fact, many are asking how a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn't and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend. Very good questions. One thought is that, among those prepared to have two children, at least some parents will have three. However, I have interviewed many young Chinese couples about this subject and it is hard to find those who want bigger families these days. Generations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they'd rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids. What did the census say? The census, released this month, showed that around 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016, and the lowest number of births recorded since the 1960s. The census was conducted in late 2020 - some seven million census takers had gone door to door to collect information from households. Given the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. It was widely expected after the census data results were released that China would relax its family policy rules. 'Too many big pressures' By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst China's leading media are giving a lot of fanfare to the \"three-child policy\". Newspaper People's Daily, broadcaster CCTV and news agency Xinhua are all posting happy cartoon images of children today on their social media pages and saying that the new policy has \"arrived\". It is already the top talking point on popular social network Sina Weibo - posts mentioning the new policy have already racked up tens of thousands of views, and hundreds of thousands of comments. More than 180,000 users have commented on Xinhua's upbeat post, and the ones with the most likes do not look upon the policy kindly. \"There are too many big pressures in life at the moment,\" one user says, \"Young people are not willing to have kids.\" Many talk about modern day \"workplace dilemmas\" for people leaving on maternity/paternity leave and there not being even \"the most basic reproductive benefits\". And with a shrinking labour market, young Chinese people today accept that they have to work longer hours. Overtime and overwork are endemic. More women meanwhile are choosing to pursue further education and employment, rather than settle down early to start a family. What were China's previous policies? The government's move in 2016 to allow couples to have two children failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \"While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature.\" China's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. The one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide. \"This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources,\" Dr Mu Zheng, from the National University of Singapore's sociology department, said. Can China lift birth restrictions entirely? Ahead of China's latest census, experts had speculated that birth restrictions might be lifted entirely - though it appears as though China is treading cautiously. But others said that such a move could potentially lead to \"other problems\" - pointing out the huge disparity between city dwellers and rural people. As much as women living in expensive cities such as Beijing and Shanghai may wish to delay or avoid childbirth, those in the countryside are likely to still follow tradition and want large families, they say. \"If we free up policy, people in the countryside could be more willing to give birth than those in the cities, and there could be other problems,\" a policy insider had earlier told Reuters, noting that it could lead to poverty and employment pressures among rural families. Experts had warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world. Dr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: \"China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China. The scope of the impact of a population decline would be very wide.\"", "summary": "La Chine annonce qu'elle va autoriser les couples à avoir jusqu'à trois enfants, après que les données du recensement montrent une forte baisse des taux de natalité."}

The study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial. Scientists said the results could mark a \"new era\" in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon. Jan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight. \"The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,\" she said. She said dieting had made her \"miserable\" but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry. 'Effortless' However, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on. She said: \"It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food.\" Semaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses. The drug works by hijacking the body's appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal. The trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without. However, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment. 'New era' Prof Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: \"This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes. \"I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we've not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery.\" She said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19. Semaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available. There were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term. Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug. \"This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects.\" Dr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: \"It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects. \"So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "Un essai international majeur démontre qu'un médicament coupe-faim conduit certaines personnes à perdre plus d'un cinquième de leur poids."}

Jurors will resume deliberations on Harlow's charge on Tuesday. Both men, of George Avenue, Ibstock, Leicestershire, are due to be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court next week. The jury deliberated for just under six hours to find Beadman guilty of false imprisonment. Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire Harlow, who is facing the same charge, has pleaded guilty to meeting Kayleigh following sexual grooming. Her disappearance on 13 November prompted an outpouring of support from the community in her home village of Measham and the wider area. The 15-year-old's body was found in a field outside Ibstock five days after she was last seen outside Ibstock Community College. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries. Kayleigh was kept prisoner at Harlow's home between about 21:00 BST on Saturday 14 November and 03:00 on 15 November, the prosecution told the court. She and Harlow had been exchanging messages via social media. The unemployed former media studies student has admitted attempting to meet two other 15-year-old girls for sexual purposes and had contacted a 13-year-old too. On the evening of Friday 13 November, Harlow and Kayleigh met for the first time. He admitted sexually touching her after she had been drinking heavily. Earlier in the trial, he denied Beadman's barrister's suggestion Kayleigh had escaped after she awoke to find he and Beadman arguing because Harlow had allegedly attempted to rape her while she slept. In the early hours of Sunday Kayleigh was seen leaving the flat. A witness said she was naked from the waist down and Beadman was pinning her to the ground. Beadman, who pleaded guilty to her rape and murder, opted not to give evidence in the trial. He told police he could not remember what had happened because he had been drinking but later confessed to first raping the teenager, then killing her with a brick. He told officers: \"When I drink I just switch. But when I switch I get violent.\" The jury of six men and five women at Nottingham Crown Court unanimously agreed he had kept her prisoner but could not reach a verdict on which they all agreed on Harlow. They will resume deliberations on Tuesday. The pair are due to appear again at the same court on Friday to be sentenced.

The state governor said about 25 people had been wounded but only one person had died. An indefinite 24-hour curfew has been imposed on Lagos and other regions. Protests over a now-disbanded police unit - the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) - have been taking place for two weeks, with demonstrators using the social media hashtag #EndSars to rally crowds. As tensions continued to rise on Wednesday, police in different districts of Lagos fired shots in the air to disperse people defying the curfew, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo reports from the capital, Abuja. Protesters who briefly gathered again at the Lekki toll gate - where Tuesday's shootings took place - were forced out by police, he adds. President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed for \"understanding and calm\". However, plumes of smoke could be seen above Lagos on Wednesday. A reporter for AFP news agency said several buildings were in flames around the Lekki area. A bus station was reported to be on fire in another district while a major TV station - linked to one of the governing party's top politicians - was reportedly set alight by people throwing petrol bombs. The headquarters of the Nigerian Ports Authority was also set on fire, local media said. What do we know about the shooting? Witnesses spoke of uniformed men opening fire in the wealthy Lekki suburb on Tuesday evening. Soldiers were seen barricading the protest site moments before the shooting, BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones reports. Social media footage streamed live from the scene shows protesters tending to the wounded. An unnamed witness told BBC News that shortly before 19:00 local time soldiers \"pulled up... and they started firing directly\" at peaceful protesters. \"They were firing and they were advancing straight at us. It was chaos. Somebody got hit straight beside me and he died on the spot,\" he said. Four witnesses told Reuters news agency that soldiers had opened fire on demonstrators. One of them, Alfred Ononugbo, 55, said: \"They were firing into the crowd. I saw the bullet hit one or two persons.\" The Premium Times newspaper quoted witnesses as saying about 12 people had been killed. In a tweet, Amnesty International Nigeria said it had \"received credible but disturbing evidence of excessive use of force occasioning deaths of protesters at Lekki toll gate in Lagos\". How have the authorities reacted? In a statement on Wednesday, President Buhari did not directly refer to the shootings, but called on people to have patience as police reforms \"gather pace\". A statement issued by his office said the dissolution of the Sars was \"the first step in a set of reform policies that will deliver a police system accountable to the Nigerian people\". \"The presidency wishes to reiterate the full commitment of the Buhari administration to the implementation of lasting police reforms in Nigeria,\" it added. The army has not issued a statement on events in Lekki, but in several Twitter posts it described media reports as \"fake news\". Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who visited hospitals on Wednesday, said about 25 people had been wounded in what he described as an \"unfortunate shooting incident\". He initially said no-one had been killed but later said one person had died in hospital due to \"blunt force trauma to the head\". Contradicting the army, he told the BBC's Newshour programme that the military had been at the scene at the time of the shooting despite public assurances that soldiers would not be deployed until after the start of a curfew at 21:00. \"I think about seven o'clock or thereabouts there was a small unit of the military that went [to Lekki] and we heard that gunshots were fired,\" he said. What other reaction has there been? Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on President Buhari and the army \"to stop killing young #EndSARS protesters\". And former US Vice-President Joe Biden - who is standing against President Donald Trump in next month's election - also urged authorities to end the \"violent crackdown on protesters\". \"The US must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,\" he said in a statement. Nigerian footballer Odion Jude Ighalo, who plays for Manchester United, accused the Nigerian government of killing its own citizens. \"I'm ashamed of this government,\" he said in a video posted on Twitter. Nigeria reacts to harrowing scenes Analysis by Mayeni Jones, BBC Nigeria Correspondent It was a bleak night in Nigeria as social media footage from the shooting poured in, showing gunshots ringing out at the protest site long into the night. This is not the first time the Nigerian army has been accused of shooting unarmed protesters. There have been reports of violent crackdowns on EndSars protesters in other parts of the country. But seeing live rounds used at one of the protest sites that had been peaceful until last night has rattled many. Just last week I stood at the very site of the shooting. The protesters were peaceful, organised, hopeful for the future of their country. But this is no more. Harrowing social media videos showing protesters singing the national anthem as shots ring out in the background have caused outrage. Multiple online accounts say the CCTV and lights were taken out at the toll gate where the protest took place before troops started advancing, leading to total chaos. These details are galvanising a generation already disillusioned with the ruling class. The Nigerian government is running out of time to quell the growing dissatisfaction. How did the unrest begin? Protests began nearly two weeks ago with calls for the Sars police unit, which had been accused of illegal detentions, assaults and shootings, to be disbanded. President Buhari dissolved the unit on 11 October. But the demonstrators called for more changes in the security forces as well as reforms to the way the country is run. Mr Sanwo-Olu has said that criminals have hijacked the protests.", "summary": "Des personnes participant à une manifestation contre les brutalités policières auraient été tuées ou blessées par balle dans la ville de Lagos au Nigeria."}

There are many Senegalese and North African soldiers on the list, but none from what was French Indo-China. Africans played a big role in the liberation of France in 1944. French Junior Defence Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq, presenting the 210-page booklet, said \"the names, faces, lives of these African heroes must become part of our lives as free citizens, because without them we would not be free\". Last month a statue of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who drew up rules for French colonies in the 17th Century, was vandalised. Many statues identified with slavery and colonialism have been knocked down or vandalised in Europe and the US. \"Rather than knocking down, I ask you to build,\" Ms Darrieussecq told mayors. \"Rather than erasing, I ask you to consider turning our public spaces into places to teach.\" She said that \"today very few of our streets are named after these African combatants, so the aim is to build\". She said plaques should explain the role of an African war hero commemorated with a statue or street name. In January, in the southern town of Bandol, a central square was named after five African soldiers who took part in the town's liberation. \"Freedom Square\" was renamed \"African Liberators Square\". More than 400,000 Africans in the Free French Forces took part in the Allies' landings in the south of France in August 1944, codenamed Operation Dragoon. They were involved in heavy fighting to liberate Toulon and Marseille. The landings were crucial to oust Nazi German forces from the south, while the Allies in northern France were pushing south, having landed in Normandy in June. After the Nazi invasion of France in 1940 many Africans in French colonies volunteered for Gen Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces, though many were also drafted into service. About 400,000 came from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and more than 70,000 from Senegal and other sub-Saharan colonies. At a ceremony last August commemorating Operation Dragoon, President Emmanuel Macron praised the Africans who made up more than 80% of the French landing forces. \"Yet who among us today remembers their names, their faces?\" he asked. Sira Sylla, an MP campaigning to get due recognition of Africans' contributions to modern France, welcomed the government initiative. \"Like it or not, their forefathers took part in the liberation of France. The history of our country and history of Africa are linked and it is urgent to spread that knowledge,\" she said. Belated recognition Among the many African soldiers who fought in WW2 are: Addi Ba. Born in Guinea in 1923, he lived in Langeais in the Loire region and fought with the Senegalese Infantry but was captured by the Germans in June 1940. He escaped with some fellow Africans from Neufchâteau in the Vosges and in 1943 helped to set up the Vosges mountains \"maquis\" - part of the French Resistance. The Germans hunted the group and caught Addi Ba, who was jailed in Épinal and tortured but refused to give them information. The Germans shot him in December 1943. A street in Langeais was named after him in 1991. Paul Koudoussaragne. Born in the Central African Republic (CAR) around 1920, he joined the Free French Forces in August 1940 and was sent to fight in the Middle East in 1941. He fought first in Syria, then in the Egypt and Cyrenaica campaigns from December 1941 to July 1942. In the battle of Bir-Hakeim he managed to bring munitions to an artillery spotter post under fire, despite a bullet wound. Gen De Gaulle awarded him the Liberation Cross in Beirut later in 1942. In 1945 he returned to action and was wounded in combat near Royan on the French Atlantic coast. He retired after the war to Bimbo in CAR, where he was a farmer until his death in 1973.", "summary": "Le ministère français des forces armées a fourni aux autorités locales un guide de 100 Africains qui ont combattu pour la France pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, afin que les rues et les places puissent porter leur nom.

Now doctors, teachers and social workers are being offered Sputnik V in a mass inoculation campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin. Its timing, just ahead of a similar launch in the UK, is unlikely to be a coincidence. But Sputnik V is still in the midst of trials to check that it's safe and actually works, making some Russians wary of receiving it yet. And despite a fanfare over the vaccine's grand rollout, there are still problems scaling up production. In a sense, this is no \"launch\" at all. Russian health workers have been getting vaccinated in tandem with the official trials for several months. Teachers have been eligible too, and VIPs including President Putin's own daughter have had the jab. The list is said to total more than 100,000 people. Bold claims \"All of the staff here have been vaccinated,\" nurse Oksana Konstantinova confirms, as she removes a tiny glass bottle of vaccine from the deep freeze at a Moscow clinic. Sputnik V has to be stored at -18C at least in its liquid form. There are plans for a more practical, powder version of the vaccine but it's not yet being made in large amounts. Why did she accept an experimental jab? \"We have to be able to say that the vaccine is safe and necessary in the current situation,\" the nurse explains. \"I was worried a bit. I am human! But I realised it was a fuss about nothing.\" Sputnik's backers claim it offers 95% protection against the coronavirus, putting Russia's offering right up alongside the vaccines of teams in the US and Europe. But here, the data released so far is based on interim results only - after just 39 trial volunteers caught Covid. That haste - coupled with such bold claims - has raised eyebrows. \"We hope the vaccine is effective, but it's difficult to trust some of the figures,\" argues Svetlana Zavidova, whose organisation monitors clinical trials in Russia. She also lists concerns that Sputnik's developers injected themselves with their own vaccine and that the product was registered for use after such limited trials. \"We don't see the point of such a rush, other than announcing how we beat the rest of the world,\" Zavidova says. \"I think there's a struggle between scientists and politicians, and the latter are winning.\" Limited issue Like other countries, Russia presents its trial results to an external panel of experts for analysis. \"I heard the interim reports and can say for sure that Sputnik is safe and can produce a short-term immune response,\" oncologist Dr Alexander Rumyantsev told the BBC. He had the vaccine himself in September and now boasts a large number of antibodies, though he said it was impossible to tell from the trial data how long any protection would last. \"We need more observation. I think we will only know that in spring.\" Around 24% of volunteers experience side effects, the doctor said. \"They were not pronounced, and they didn't create any serious problems.\" But there have been problems for Sputnik of another kind. Its developers used to boast that tens of millions of doses of their vaccine would be rolling off conveyer belts this year, but they've had to scale-back expectations. Even President Putin now expects a modest two million doses of Sputnik this month. The Russian vaccine comprises two entirely different injections - using different \"vectors\" or carriers for the coronavirus each time. Its backers insist that makes it more effective, but it also piles extra pressure on producers. \"Russia has taken on a crazy task,\" Dmitry Morozov says, arguing that biotech firms like his should have been consulted on the practicalities at the very start. \"They basically doubled the work for us. It's like you need to make two cars to actually move forward, but they're both completely different: a Jeep and a mini bus,\" he explains. \"That's a serious challenge. It means we have a far tougher task than most other manufacturers.\" Even so, Morozov is confident his firm, Biocad, can produce \"millions\" of doses of Sputnik. Its test batches are in Moscow now, waiting to be quality-cleared. Another source told the BBC that producers have struggled with the second Sputnik jab in particular. \"The first component is the most stable, we can produce more of it,\" the source said. \"The second is less so and we have to keep strict temperature controls. I think it will soon be resolved.\" Tough sell But even when production lines are up and running, there could be another issue to contend with. We only saw a handful of people getting injected on the first day of \"mass\" vaccination. On Monday, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta described similar scenes at another Moscow clinic. According to the paper, a nurse had to throw some Sputnik V away when she defrosted it and no-one turned up. That's a worry when the country is being hit hard by Covid, reporting close to 30,000 new cases a day. But it seems many Russians may have decided to wait. \"A lot of people don't believe in the vaccine at this point,\" Svetlana Zavidova believes. \"I hope if there's real scientific data, they will change their minds.\"", "summary": "Son nom à lui seul suffit à exprimer les ambitions de la Russie : Spoutnik V, le principal vaccin du pays contre le Covid-19, est censé être un champion planétaire, tout comme son homonyme spatial."}

Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of about 200 parents protesting outside the school, reports said. Kenya passed a law in 2017 to provide free sanitary towels for schoolgirls. However, a parliamentary committee is currently investigating why the programme is yet to be rolled out across all schools. The girl's mother said a teacher had called her \"dirty\" for soiling her uniform and ordered her to leave the class in Kabiangek, west of the capital Nairobi, last Friday. \"She had nothing to use as a pad. When the blood stained her clothes, she was told to leave the classroom and stand outside,\" the mother was quoted as saying in Kenyan media. She said her daughter came home and told her mother what had happened, but then when she went to fetch water she took her own life. Her parents reported the matter to the police but became frustrated by an apparent lack of action, the Daily Nation reported. Together with other parents they staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday. Police moved in and made five arrests when the demonstrators blocked a road and pulled down the school gate, reports said. The school has since been closed. Regional police chief Alex Shikondi said the circumstances of the girl's death were being investigated. The school's headteacher has declined to comment. In Kenya, as in other countries, many girls cannot afford sanitary products such as pads and tampons. A UN report in 2014 said that one in 10 girls in sub-Saharan Africa missed school during their period. Some girls reportedly lose 20% of their education for this reason, making them more likely to drop out of school altogether, the report said.", "summary": "Une écolière au Kenya s'est suicidée après avoir été humiliée en classe pour avoir eu ses règles et avoir taché son uniforme."}

But as well as the ceremonial plaques, sculptures, and buildings there are a few other things bearing Mr Obama's name that you may not have expected. Parasite Baracktrema obamai is the second parasite whose moniker was inspired by Mr Obama. The flatworm species, which has a long, thread-like body, infects Malaysian freshwater turtles and can be fatal. \"This is clearly something, in my small way, done to honour our president,\" said Dr Thomas R Platt, an expert on turtle parasites who discovered the species. He also said he was a distant relative of Mr Obama. Researchers have previously named a hairworm, the Paragordius obamai, found in Kenya, after Mr Obama. The worm was discovered near where Mr Obama's father lived. Fish As part of a tribute to Mr Obama's marine conservation efforts in the Pacific, scientists named a maroon and gold fish found off Kure Atoll at the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off Hawaii. In 2012, researchers named a vibrant blue and orange freshwater darter, Etheostoma Obama, after Mr Obama. The fish is found in the Duck and Buffalo Rivers of the Tennessee River drainage. Lizard The Obamadon, an extinct, foot-long lizard with straight teeth, was named for the president due to his smile. Mountain Mr Obama is among the US presidents to have the distinction of a mountain named in his honour - but in Antigua. The island nation renamed Boggy Peak, its highest mountain, for Mr Obama on his birthday in 2009. Lichen In 2007, researchers named the fungus, Caloplaca obamae, after Mr Obama at the close of his first presidential campaign. Scientists made the distinction in honour of Mr Obama's support for science education. Petrol station An Irish countryside service station located in County Offaly, between Dublin and Limerick, was officially named for the US president. The Barack Obama Plaza includes a petrol station, food court and visitor centre that provides information on Mr Obama's connections to Moneygall. Bread Ahead of Mr Obama's visit to Ireland in 2011, bakers rushed to create Irish \"Brack\" bread - something Americans might refer to as a fruit loaf. Moneygall resident Joseph Kearney delivered fresh orders to Mr Obama's ancestral Irish family members preparing for \"O'Bama's\" visit. Bird A Western Striolated puffbird, known as Nystalus obamai, is also named in honour of the president. The bird is found in western Amazonia. School A Kenyan school in the village of Kogelo, where Mr Obama's father was born and buried, bears the name of Mr Obama. The Senator Obama Kogelo Primary School and Senator Obama Kogelo Secondary School were named in his honour while he was an Illinois politician. Spider A trapdoor spider, Aptostichus barackobamai, was also named for Mr Obama, a known Spider-Man fan. The spider species, which is found in California, is one of 40 that belong to the genus Aptostichus. Other notable species include Aptostichus stephencolberti and Aptostichus angelinajolieae.", "summary": "Alors que Barack Obama achève ses deux mandats de président des Etats-Unis, des bibliothèques, des écoles et des routes sont inaugurées ou rebaptisées au nom du président américain."}

Of those people with antibodies, 40% had no other symptoms. The research only looked at people with mild symptoms, however. Evidence that loss of smell and taste could be signs of coronavirus began to emerge from about April, and they were added to the official list of symptoms in mid-May. Current guidance states anyone who experiences a loss of, or change to their sense of smell or taste should self-isolate and apply for a test. But lead author of the UCL study, Prof Rachel Batterham, says cough and fever are still seen by many as the main symptoms to look out for. She recruited people between 23 April and 14 May by sending out texts via four GP surgeries in London, enrolling those who reported losing their smell or taste in the previous four weeks. All of these participants were tested for antibodies, and four out of five were positive, suggesting a previous Covid-19 infection. The study was constrained by the fact that all its participants had mild symptoms, including or limited to a loss of smell or taste, so they may not be representative of all Covid patients. But its findings emphasise the importance of people looking out for any change to their sense of smell or taste, and self-isolating if they realise they can't smell \"everyday\" items like perfume, bleach, toothpaste, or coffee, Prof Batterham said. While not all coronavirus patients will necessarily lose their sense of smell, if you do lose your sense of smell it is highly likely to be coronavirus, this research seems to suggest. The thing to look out for is a loss of smell without having a blocked or runny nose, Prof Batterham explained. It's thought loss of smell happens with Covid-19 because the virus invades the cells found at the back of the nose, throat and on the tongue. This is distinct from the experience of having a cold where smell and taste might be altered because a person's airways are blocked. King's College London researchers, who run the Covid Symptom Study app, previously estimated 60% of people with coronavirus lost their sense of smell or taste. Although this is considered a milder symptom and unlikely to land someone in hospital, Prof Batterham points out the potential dangers of losing your sense of smell including not being able to detect smoke, leaking gas or food that has gone off. If suffered longer term, it can also have a significant impact on people's quality of life. Thousands of people online have reported worrying experiences including causing fires and not being able to smell the smoke. Some have noticed constantly smelling a rancid \"garbage\" odour or experiencing a metallic taste, while others have found themselves unable to taste food for months after being clear of the virus. The group of people who only lose their smell without experiencing any other symptoms may also pose the \"greatest risk\" to others since they may feel generally well and carry on going about their daily lives, Prof Batterham pointed out. Although the two often go together, loss of or change to smell was more common than loss of taste among people who have recovered from coronavirus, she said. Her research took place at a time when loss of smell and taste were not recognised symptoms of the virus. Follow Rachel on Twitter. How has coronavirus affected you?

Really private things that he shouldn't have known about. If I asked how he knew these things, he'd say I'd told him and accuse me of losing it,\" she says. Amy - not her real name - also began to wonder how he seemed to know where she was all the time. \"Sometimes he would say he saw me at a cafe where I was meeting my friends and say he was just passing by chance. I started to question everything and trust no-one, even my friends,\" she says. For months, these incidents built up, turning an abusive marriage into a nightmare that came to a chilling conclusion after a Halloween family trip. \"We'd been to visit a pumpkin patch and were having a rare good weekend, which basically means my husband hadn't taken anything out on me. Our six-year-old son was playing on the floor and was so happy,\" Amy says. \"My husband passed me his phone to show me a picture he'd taken at the farm and in that split-second I saw an alert pop up on his screen. It read, 'Daily report on Amy's Mac is ready to view.' \"I felt this chill go through me and I stopped breathing for a minute. I had to excuse myself and pretended I needed the bathroom. I had to be there for my son and pretend that I hadn't seen anything. \"The first moment I could, I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware he'd used. That's when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy.\" Stalkerware - also known as spouseware - are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online. On a device, all messages can be read, screen activity recorded, GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing. Tips to avoid being victimised: Don’t leavedevice unattended – most software requires physical access Ditch fingerprintlock - a partner can use your print while you sleep Add security app- antivirus software can also detect spyware and remove it According to cyber-security company Kaspersky, the number of people who have discovered such software on their devices has risen by at least 35% in the past year. Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37,532 devices so far this year. And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the \"tip of a very large iceberg\". \"Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop, not that many people actually protect a mobile device,\" he says. \"This information is coming back from installations of our product on [smartphones]... so this figure doesn't even go close to what the total would be.\" Kaspersky's findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity. India, Brazil, the United States and Germany complete the top five, with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections. Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on. \"It's always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them,\" says Jake Moore, from Eset. \"As a general rule, if you aren't using an app, delete it.\" Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised, she developed a severe mistrust of technology, which she is only just overcoming. Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma. Jessica was another victim of stalkerware. Her ex-husband routinely spied on her through her phone's microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations. It's been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends. Gemma Toynton, from domestic abuse charity Safer Places, says she see this long-term effect a lot in her cases. \"It reduces someone's trust,\" she says. \"It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon, because that's what it's been used for. \"Technology has become, in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet. \"It really does impact your whole life. The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern.\" Amy, who is from the US, is now divorced and lives many miles away from her ex-husband. She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their son's care via written letter only. Put to the test I tested out one of the most popular consumer products, which costs £140 for three months of surveillance. I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone. It took me about an hour and I used the 24-hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems. Spyware companies advertise their services as \"employee monitoring\" or \"parental control\" products. In many countries, including the UK, using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal, so many of the companies' websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this. However, some of the same websites link to articles, seemingly written by associates, recommending the software as a spy tool for \"cheatings wives and husbands\". In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing, I directly told them: \"I want to install this on my wife's phone, will it be secret?\" The customer service-representative responded: \"The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation. I'll be happy to help.\" I also downloaded five of the top cyber-security products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan. All of them gave alerts for \"potentially harmful software\". The Crown Prosecution Service says there aren't specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies. \"They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability,\" she says. \"There is a wink that's given when they send this little disclaimer that says, 'We don't approve of you spying on wives.' They know what their customers are doing though. This software causes real harm.\"", "summary": "Amy déclare que tout a commencé quand son mari semblait connaître des détails intimes sur ses amies."}

Two vessels will conduct sonar surveys off Guernsey, said David Mearns who is coordinating part of the search. There were emotional tributes to the footballer as Cardiff played their first home game since the disappearance earlier on Saturday. Argentine Sala, 28, and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, were travelling from Nantes, where Sala previously played, when the flight was lost. Cushions believed to be from the plane were found on a beach near Surtainville, on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said Geo Ocean III departed at 09:00 GMT on Saturday with investigators on board, and is expected to arrive at the search area at 09:00 on Sunday to start the underwater search, which will last three days. Cardiff City played their first match at home since Sala, the club's record £15m signing, went missing. A minute's silence was held before the game with Bournemouth at 17:30 GMT. Cardiff's match shirts were embroidered with daffodils and players warmed up in t-shirts paying tribute to Sala. Speaking from Guernsey harbour, Mr Mearns said his team would work jointly with a second vessel commissioned by the AAIB. They plan to search an area covering two square miles about 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. It has been based on the flight path before it lost radar contact, said Mr Mearns, a shipwreck hunter. \"The family are devastated and struggling with what has happened,\" he said. \"What we are doing is trying to provide some answers for them.\" An official search following the plane's disappearance was called off after three days with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived. It prompted a privately-funded search to be set up after £324,000 was raised in an online appeal. Sala's family arrived on Guernsey following his disappearance and were taken to see the area that was searched, circling the island of Alderney. Mr Mearns said both vessels would divide the search area in half, looking for \"wreckage\" and a \"debris field\" in a depth of 60-120m (196-390ft). \"We will continue to work until the plane is located,\" he said.", "summary": "Les secouristes ont annulé les recherches de l'avion qui a disparu depuis lundi avec le footballeur argentin Emiliano Sala."}

An epidemic that ravaged parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016 killed more than 11,000 people. What is the WHO complaining about? A statement on Saturday said that on 10 September the organisation had learned of a suspected infection in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's most populous city, in what would be the country's first Ebola case. It said the patient had been to Uganda, shown symptoms of Ebola in August, tested positive and died on 8 September. It said that the woman's contacts had been quarantined. The WHO said it had unofficial reports of two other possible cases. It said: \"Despite several requests, WHO did not receive further details of any of these cases from Tanzanian authorities.\" It added: \"The limited available official information from Tanzanian authorities represents a challenge for assessing the risk posed by this event.\" What has Tanzania said in response? On 14 September, Tanzania said there were no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola in the country. However, it did not directly address the case of the woman mentioned by the WHO and provided no further information. Last week, US Health Secretary Alex Azar criticised Tanzania for its failure to share information on possible cases. Tanzania is heavily reliant on tourism, which could be affected by confirmed cases. What is the latest on the outbreak? It began in the eastern DR Congo in August last year and is the biggest of 10 Ebola outbreaks to hit the country since 1976, when the virus was first discovered. In July, the WHO declared the Ebola crisis in the country a \"public health emergency of international concern\". There have been more than 3,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths. Other nations are on high alert. Four people have died after being diagnosed with the virus in Uganda, which has maintained largely successful screening centres along its border.

President Donald Trump's America First foreign policy has seen the US thumb its nose at multilateral agreements from the Paris Climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal, while China is visibly positioning itself as the new supporter of the United Nations. But growing Chinese influence comes at a price, and if Beijing is devoting more money to fund UN agencies like the World Health Organization then it will want more say as a result. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres spoke of a foundational moment facing the UN - those who built the United Nations knew the value of unity, he noted, since they had lived through war and an earlier pandemic. Anxieties about what the US China rivalry means for global stability abounded at this remote gathering of world leaders. There was no disguising the urgency of French President Emmanuel Macron's tone, as he said in his pre-recorded remarks that today's world can't be left to the rivalry between China and the US. That rivalry, which has seen the two countries lock horns on everything from trade to technology, is becoming increasingly acrimonious - and President Trump dialled up the rhetoric, using his platform on the world stage to rail against what he called the China virus. With less than 40 days to go until the US election, Bejing bashing is central to the Trump campaign. It appears there is a concerted effort under way to deflect criticism of the president's handling of the outbreak by slamming China for exporting the virus. Would a bi-polar world in which the US and China vie for supremacy eventually lead to military conflict? Clearly the UN Secretary General is concerned about what lies ahead, warning of another \"Cold War\". \"We are moving in a very dangerous direction,\" Mr Guterres said. \"Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities. A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geostrategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.\" This open discussion about the consequences of a \"great fracture \" shows how rapidly the world is changing, and how diplomats are scrambling to keep up. China's President Xi Jinping actually declared at the virtual general debate that \"China has no intention to fight either a Cold War or a hot one with any country.\" That statement was telling. The presidency of Donald Trump has heightened tensions with China, to the point where speculation about where all this leads is rife. An experienced diplomat told me on Tuesday that the general debate at the UN was always seen as creative chaos. As world leaders came together and glad handed and met in private, real diplomacy was done. Now, it's just chaos, said this old hand sadly, asking rhetorically who's in charge, and which world leader has more than just narrow self interest at heart. The pandemic has exploited the injustices of the world, observed the UN secretary general. People are hurting, our planet is burning, he said, imploring world leaders to see Covid-19 as a wake up call and a dress rehearsal for the challenges ahead. Yet within an hour of Mr Guterres saying solidarity is self-interest, President Trump declared that all world leaders should follow his example and put their countries first. If he is re-elected, his unilateralism will become more pronounced, and the United Nations will probably be further marginalised by Washington. Would the US commitment to NATO weaken too? Were Joe Biden to be elected president, the tension between Washington and Beijing might be lessened, but the fundamental US China rivalry would remain. The world is realigning, and the question now is how the old multilateral order adapts - and who will lead it.", "summary": "Les Nations unies célèbrent leur 75e anniversaire dans un contexte où l'ordre mondial de l'après-guerre semble remis en cause."}

She was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living. She had attributed her longevity to her genetics and a diet of three eggs a day, two of them raw. Ms Morano was the oldest of eight siblings, all of whom she has outlived. She died at her home in the northern city of Verbania. Her life not only spanned three centuries but also survived an abusive marriage, the loss of her only son, two World Wars and more than 90 Italian governments. 'Good genes and eggs' Ms Morano had admitted that her longevity was partly down to genetics: her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary. But it was also down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs - two raw - each day for more than 90 years. It was a regime she took up as a young woman, after the doctor diagnosed her with anaemia shortly after World War One. She had cut down to just two eggs a day, and a few biscuits recently. Her doctor of 27 years, Carlo Bava, had told AFP news agency that she rarely ate vegetables or fruit. \"When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.\" 'I didn't want to be dominated' Ms Morano also credited her longevity to her decision, in 1938, to kick out her husband - a year after her baby boy died at just six months old. The marriage had never been healthy, she said. She had been in love with a boy who was killed during World War One, and had no interest in marrying someone else. But, she told La Stampa newspaper in an interview when she was a spritely 112 that she was left with little choice. \"He told me: 'If you're lucky you marry me, or I'll kill you'. I was 26 years old. I got married.\" Eventually, it became too much. Though they separated in 1938, they remained married until he died in 1978. Ms Morano, who worked until she was 75, chose never to marry again. \"I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,\" she told the New York Times. She had only taken on a full-time carer a couple of years ago - but had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years.

The tanker is said to have crashed after its brakes failed. Fuel explosions are common in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. Petrol is transported via badly maintained roads and vehicles. The incident on Thursday occurred at about 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, one of the main motorways into the city. A representative from the Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) told the BBC that the tanker had lost control as it approached a bridge, and ended up falling on its side. Petrol then began pouring from the tanker and a fire erupted. The blaze quickly spread from vehicle to vehicle. Images later showed black smoke rising from the road and the shells of several burnt-out cars. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said he was \"very sad to learn of the tragic loss of lives\". \"Sadly, this seems to be one of the greatest tragedies we have seen in recent times,\" he said in a statement.

Disaster waiting to happen By Sam Olukoya, BBC News, Lagos By Friday morning the full scale of Thursday's tragedy was still visible as rescue workers clear the road of the burnt-out remains of the vehicles. An acrid smell still hangs in the air. It's a gory scene many Nigerians are all-too familiar with. Oil tankers have been involved in some of Nigeria's worst road accidents. Many of these tankers were conveying imported fuel from the Lagos port for distribution around the country. Even though Nigeria is the world's sixth largest exporter of crude oil, the country imports virtually all its fuel because its refineries are not working due to years of mismanagement. The Lagos port remains the main entry for the fuel that serves Nigeria's almost 200 million people. It is a disaster always waiting to happen in a country where fuel distribution is in the hands of often reckless oil tanker drivers. Most of them are driving tankers imported from Europe that are not roadworthy. While Nigerians mourn the victims of this latest accident, many know it may not be the last, if efforts are not made to get good drivers and vehicles for Nigeria's fuel distribution business.", "summary": "Un camion-citerne a pris feu dans la plus grande ville du Nigeria, Lagos, tuant au moins neuf personnes, selon les autorités."}

Hitler spent the first few weeks of his life in a flat in the 17th-Century building in the town of Braunau am Inn. The fate of the property has been the subject of a lengthy dispute. For decades, the government rented it from its former owner in an attempt to stop far-right tourism. It was once a day-care centre for disabled people, but this ended when owner Gerlinde Pommer objected to plans to make it more wheelchair-friendly and then refused all government offers to buy it or carry out renovations. A plan to turn it into a centre for refugees in 2014 also came to nothing. The government took possession of the house in 2016 under a compulsory purchase order, for a price of 810,000 euros ($897,000; £694,000). There has been widespread debate and disagreement in Austria over the fate of the building. Some have called for it to be torn down, while others argued it should be used for charity work or as a house of reconciliation. In his statement on Tuesday, Mr Peschorn said the house's \"future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism\". Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, where his father had been posted for work, on 20 April 1889. The family stayed in an apartment in the building for a few weeks after his birth before moving to another address in the area. They left the town for good when Hitler was three years old. He returned briefly in 1938, on his way to Vienna, after he annexed Austria to Nazi Germany. Under Hitler's rule (1933-45), Nazi Germany began World War Two, pursuing a genocidal policy that resulted in the deaths of some six million Jews, and tens of millions of other civilians and combatants.

Whenever I would share a photo or a selfie on social media, he would get upset about who's liking my photo, who's commenting on it,\" Ms Harikumar told the BBC. Since she didn't want to make him angry, she trimmed her friends' list, unfriended her exes and restricted access to male friends. \"Even when he was not present, I was thinking for him - before putting a post, I was trying to anticipate how he would react? Soon, I was putting the same restrictions on my life offline too. I was walking on eggshells.\" But that didn't help - he still found things to get angry about. \"One day, he got upset by a random tweet that someone had put out saying 'I'll do anything for a person with a nose stud'. A friend with a sizeable number of followers tagged me and commented, 'Then you should look at Indu.' \"I had not seen the tweet, but my partner sent me a message saying 'you have pimps in high places',\" she says, adding that it was not the only abuse she'd faced online. Ms Harikumar's latest crowd-sourced Instagram art project - LoveSexandTech - draws from her own personal experiences and those of other women of \"online abuse\". It's supported by Take Back the Tech, a global campaign to make digital space safer for women. Online abuse is pervasive globally and a lot of it is directed at women. They are trolled for their politics or opinions, many often complain of receiving threats of rapes and sexual assault. In 2017, Amnesty International polled 4,000 women from eight countries and found that 76% of women who were abused on social media restricted their use - 32% said they had stopped expressing opinions on some issues. In India too, the report said, that increasing access to the internet had resulted in more women facing online abuse for participating in public life and sharing their opinions on social media platforms. Campaigners say online abuse has the power to \"belittle, demean, intimidate and eventually silence women\". But the nameless, faceless trolls are one thing, a much bigger problem is how does one deal with abuse from their loved ones? That is what LoveSexandTech is documenting - how gender-based violence in intimate relationships leads to a shrinkage of the space women occupy online. Ms Harikumar says when she first put out a post in August asking women to share their stories about \"restrictions, surveillance and control placed by intimate partners\", she didn't think she would get many responses. She initially called her project Love, Sex and Violence but then \"I realised that in India, a lot of violations are not even considered violence, especially the emotional ones\". So, she spelt it out in greater details, explaining that \"this could be anything from the threat to make a chat you shared with them public or with friends, threatening to leak your nude photos or leaking them, causing you emotional, physical or sexual harm for talking to someone online or posting something that they don't approve of, or adding spyware to your devices\". Within days, Ms Harikumar says, lots of women responded with their stories of having faced \"gaslighting, control, slut-shaming, emotional violence and manipulation\". \"I didn't think I'd get such a lot of stories,\" she says, adding that many women said they had suppressed their trauma for long and found that sharing their stories was \"cathartic\". At the same time, they wanted their stories to serve as a warning to others who found themselves in a similar situation. One woman, who wrote in saying she was \"very conscious of her body\", spoke about her shock on finding out that her lover had shared her nude photo online without her consent. \"Three weeks after he'd shared it, he showed it to me saying 'hope you take it in the right spirit'. He was pleased that so many men said they desired me sexually. \"He said, 'These men can only desire you, but I alone can have you.' I called him a pervert. He said he did it because he wanted me to feel good about my body. But I felt so violated.\" Another wrote in saying she stopped posting selfies because every time she posted one, her boyfriend would berate her, telling her it was her way of seeking validation. Yet another said her partner badgered her until she shared her email password with him saying \"you're hiding something or you're talking to other men\". And another woman said her partner used her thumb to unlock her phone as she slept and later shamed her over a video she had watched online. Almost all the women, Ms Harikumar says, narrated experiences similar to her own - that in an attempt to make their relationship work, they'd stopped talking to their exes, deleted them from their friends' list, and stopped posting selfies. They had also removed photos showing cleavage, or where they were smoking or drinking. \"They were deleting their history in an attempt to appear good. Most women take refuge in the 'good girl narrative'. It's universal - it keeps them safe. We are told women can only be of two kinds - Mother Mary or a slut. \"So, we think if we are good, things will pan out okay. We often blame ourselves when things go wrong.\" But what is heartening, she says, is that the women who \"sent in their stories said they'd realised that they were being abused and stood up to their abusers\". One woman wrote in about how she stood up to her ex-boyfriend when he threatened to send her photos to her dad. \"I'll tell him your daughter is a slut,\" he said. Another said her ex-boyfriend threatened to share her nudes online when she broke up with him. He backed down when she threatened to call the police on him. \"The worst thing is if you don't stand up to your abuser, then more than feeling hatred for them, you feel anger towards yourself. You blame yourself for not standing up for yourself,\" Ms Harikumar says. Through LoveSexandTech, she says, she is trying to document stories of women acknowledging the abuse, standing up to their abusers, and taking back control of technology to reclaim the virtual space that is rightfully theirs.", "summary": "Il y a quelques années, lorsque l'artiste indienne Indu Harikumar est tombée amoureuse, elle a pensé que c'était l'amour parfait."}

He tried calling back but nobody answered. He didn't know it but his phone had been compromised. As a Rwandan exile living in Leeds, Mr Rukundo was already privacy conscious. He searched for the number online and found the dialling code was from Sweden. Strange, he thought. But he soon forgot about it. Then the number called once more. Again nobody picked up. There were also missed calls from other numbers he did not recognise and he began to get worried about his family's safety, so he bought a new phone. Within a day, the unknown number called again. \"I tried to answer and they hung up before I heard any voice,\" Mr Rukundo told the BBC. \"Whenever I called back, no-one answered. I realised something was wrong when I started seeing files missing from the phone. \"I spoke to my colleagues at the Rwanda National Congress and they too had similar experiences. They were getting missed calls from the same numbers as me.\" The Rwanda National Congress is a group that opposes the Rwandan regime. It was not until May, when Mr Rukundo read reports that WhatsApp had been hacked, that he realised what had happened. \"I first read the story about the WhatsApp hack on the BBC and thought, 'Wow, this could explain what's happened to me,'\" he said. \"I changed my phone and realised my mistake. They were following my number around and putting the spy software on each new device by calling the same number.\" For months, Mr Rukundo was convinced that he and his colleagues were some of the estimated 1,400 people targeted by attackers exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp. But it was only confirmed to him this week following a call from Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. For six months, the organisation has been working with Facebook to investigate the hack and find out who was affected. Researchers there say: \"As part of our investigation into the incident, Citizen Lab has identified over 100 cases of abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe.\" Mr Rukundo's profile as an outspoken critic of the Rwandan regime is consistent with the sort of people who were targets for this spyware. It was allegedly built and sold by the Israel-based NSO Group and sold to governments around the world. Hackers used the software to spy on journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and diplomats. Mr Rukundo says he has not had any calls since the original hack, but the experience has made him and his family feel paranoid and scared. \"Honestly, even before they confirmed this, we were gutted and terrified. It looks like they only bugged my phone for around two weeks but they had access to everything,\" he told the BBC. \"Not only my activity during that time but my whole email history and all my contacts and connections. Everything is watched, the computers, our phones, nothing is safe. Even when we talk, they could be listening. I still don't feel safe.\" Mr Rukundo fled Rwanda in 2005 when critics of the government were being arrested and jailed. He says he fought to have his wife released after she was kidnapped and detained for two months on a family visit in 2007. Facebook, the owner of WhatsApp, is attempting to sue the NSO Group. The NSO Group denies any wrongdoing. In court documents, Facebook accuses the company of exploiting a then-unknown vulnerability in WhatsApp. The app is used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries. The service is popular for its end-to-end encryption, which means messages are scrambled as they travel across the internet, making them unreadable if intercepted. The filing at the US District Court of Northern California describes how the spyware was allegedly installed. The powerful software known as Pegasus is an NSO Group product that can remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from mobile devices, by sharing all phone activity including communications and location data with the attacker. In previous spyware attacks, victims have been tricked into downloading the software by clicking on booby-trapped web links. But with the WhatsApp hack, Facebook alleges that it was installed on victims' phones without them taking any action at all. The company says that between January 2018 and May 2019, NSO Group created WhatsApp accounts using telephone numbers registered in different counties, including Cyprus, Israel, Brazil, Indonesia, Sweden and the Netherlands. Then in April and May, the victims were attacked with a phone call over WhatsApp, it is claimed. The filing says: \"To avoid the technical restrictions built into WhatsApp Signaling Servers, defendants formatted call initiation messages containing malicious code to appear like a legitimate call and concealed the code within call settings. \"Disguising the malicious code as call settings enabled defendants to deliver it to the target device and made the malicious code appear as if it originated from WhatsApp Signaling Servers.\" The victims would be completely unaware that they had been bugged. In some cases the only thing they noticed were mysterious missed calls in WhatsApp logs. The document states that Facebook: NSO Group has been accused of supplying the spyware that let the killers of journalist Jamal Khashoggi track him down. NSO Group denies involvement in that incident and says it will fight these latest allegations. \"In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" the company said in a statement to the BBC. \"The sole purpose of NSO Group is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\"", "summary": "En avril, Faustin Rukundo a reçu un mystérieux appel sur WhatsApp d'un numéro qu'il n'a pas reconnu."}

Journalists Fellipe Abreu and Henrique Hedler visited two Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshops, in the capital Accra and the southern city of Kumasi, to meet the carpenters making custom-made coffins. The shops are named after Seth Kane Kwei, who some say first designed fantasy coffins in Ghana. With Ghana being one of the world's largest cocoa producers, families in rural areas collect and save their hard-earned money to bury the deceased in custom-made cocoa pods. Coffins like this can cost up to $1,000 (£780) - a huge amount for the farmers, most of whom earn less than $3 a day. Generally, the coffin designs reflect the occupation or status of the deceased. In this case \"the chilli pepper carries a symbolic meaning that goes well beyond the life of a farmer\", says workshop manager Eric Adjetey, who's been in the business for 50 years. The red colour and spiciness represents the personality of that person. \"He was hot and temperamental, a person you don't want to mess around with.\" Coffins in the style of a Mercedes Benz are popular - this one is for a wealthy man who owned the German-made car, and his grave will be dug to fit it. \"This is one of the most commonly used coffins. It represents the person's high social status,\" says coffin maker Steve Ansah. You may also like: Most people call the pieces of art fantasy coffins, but they are locally called Abeduu Adekai, which means \"proverb boxes\". This is because there is a symbolic meaning behind each design. Aeroplanes are also among the popular designs. This one is for a child. It symbolizes his successful journey to the afterlife. Sometimes community members chip in to help with the costs of making a coffin. In recent years, the real estate sector has boomed in Ghana. This coffin is for a landlord who was widely appreciated by his community for building and renting homes to them. \"Generally, it's the responsibility of loved ones and family members to buy the coffin for the deceased. But they also have to pay for the ceremony, including buying food and drink, and clothing for the deceased.\" \"The ceremony happens from Thursday to Monday. On Thursday the family gets the coffin; on Friday the body is brought from the mortuary; on Saturday the funeral takes places, while on Sunday people go to church. On Monday family members count the money that was invested and donated,\" Mr Adjetey says. Carpenters carve the coffin, then sand it to create a uniform surface ready to be painted. A local singer will be buried in this microphone-shaped coffin. \"We don't know the person's size so we ask the family, or even rely on photos,\" says Mr Ansah, the carpenter. In recent years, other carpenters have started making custom-made coffins to meet the booming local demand. The palanquin and queen is actually not a coffin, it was custom-made for an art gallery in Philadelphia in the US. Customers in more than 20 countries have bought these coffins over the last decades. The coffin designs have also attracted interest from woodworking students in South Korea, Russia, US and Denmark, who have come to Ghana to learn the trade. Local carpenters often use simple handmade tools to sand the wood and carve the wood into a coffin shape.

Instead, the 67-year-old retired nurse died. \"It was horrible,\" her grieving daughter-in-law Thalita Rocha told the BBC. \"It was a catastrophe. Many elderly patients began to deteriorate and turn blue.\" In an emotional video that went viral on social media, she described what was happening at Policlínica Redenção in the northern Brazilian city of Manaus. \"We're in a desperate situation. An entire emergency unit has simply run out of oxygen... A lot of people are dying.\" Brazil has the world's second-highest Covid death toll with more than 221,000 fatalities. In Manaus, the health system has collapsed twice during the pandemic and deaths doubled between December and January. Now there are fears the lack of oxygen supplies seen there could unfold elsewhere in Brazil and even in other parts of Latin America, where a second wave of Covid-19, in many countries, is proving to be worse than the first one. In Peru, some hospitals have been unable to meet the demand brought by a steep rise in cases in recent weeks. As a result, patients' relatives have had to hunt for oxygen in the black market. In some cases, they come back with nothing. A black market is also thriving in Mexico, where more than 155,000 have died in the pandemic. To make things worse, there have been reports of thieves taking oxygen cylinders from hospitals and clinics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) one in five Covid-19 patients will require oxygen. In severe cases, this rises to three in five. The organisation says some hospitals have seen demand for oxygen increase between five and seven times above normal levels because of the influx of patients with severe and critical disease. The most dramatic situation in the world is in Brazil, where nearly 340,000 oxygen cylinders are needed every day, according to the Covid-19 Oxygen Needs tracker. The online tool helps estimate the scale of the challenge for policymakers and was developed by the Covid-19 Respiratory Care Response Coordination partnership which includes Path and Every Breath Counts. Also according to the tracker, Mexico and Colombia each need more than 100,000 cylinders daily. So how does a hospital run out of oxygen? Oxygen has been considered an essential medicine by the WHO since 2017, but Lisa Smith, from Path's market dynamics program, says ensuring adequate supply depends on many \"components\" falling into place. This includes not only sources of production, but also training to enable medical staff to monitor and manage oxygen levels. Medical oxygen is produced in large quantities at plants and delivered to hospitals in two ways: either in bulk in liquid tanks or as pressurised gas in cylinders containing smaller volumes. Liquid oxygen is the cheapest and best technology available but it requires hospitals to have the right infrastructure to pipe oxygen to the patient's bedside. This is common in developed countries such as the US and those in Europe. Cylinders do not require pipes and can be delivered to clinics without a sophisticated infrastructure. However, their distribution on a smaller scale means they are less cost-effective, in addition to being cumbersome to transport and handle, which also carries an increased risk of cross-contamination. Another source of production is on-site oxygen plants, which produce oxygen to be piped or compressed into cylinders. The WHO says it is currently trying to map how many such plants exist in the countries. After Manaus reached crisis point, oxygen donations were sent from the federal government and other states - as the local providers said they were unable to increase production - and across the border from Venezuela. But even transporting them became a problem. Jesem Orellana, an epidemiologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, said the risk of shortage continued and was exacerbated by global demand. According to Path, medical oxygen accounts for just 5-10% of the world's oxygen production. The rest is used in various industries, such as mining, chemical and pharmaceutical. \"We need to think about oxygen as much as we think about electricity, water or other essential utilities,\" says Ms Smith. \"This can't be something that we're only concerned about when it's bad, because when it's bad, people will die.\" In the meantime, there are concerns that the strain of Covid-19 on oxygen supplies could have a knock-on effect for the treatment of other diseases. \"Covid has shown us just how essential it is in countries where there is no vaccine against Covid, no medicines,\" says Leith Greenslade, who leads the Every Breath Counts Coalition. \"Often, it's down to whether you get oxygen or not, whether you live or die.\" Additional reporting by BBC News Brasil's Vinicius Lemos in São Paulo", "summary": "Avant que la clinique ne manque d'oxygène, Maria Auxiliadora da Cruz avait montré des signes encourageants de progrès contre le Covid-19."}

But after the stock market took a bad tumble in March last year and dealt his pension savings a blow, he decided that he should, as he puts it, \"take a more active role in managing my money\". As a dual national with British and American citizenship, he had no difficulty in setting up an account with US trading platform Robinhood, which has found itself at the centre of the GameStop furore. And, encouraged by friends, he started checking out Reddit's chat thread wallstreetbets. \"I thought, 'This is crazy,'\" he told the BBC. \"Lots of people losing lots of money.\" \"I didn't give it much thought until my friend said, 'You should check out GameStop.' And I realised that some of the people on Reddit do some really impressive work in researching those stocks.\" Risky position Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. And some of the research on Reddit indicated that positions taken by short-sellers accounted for more than 100% of existing GameStop shares, Alex says. \"People had done research showing what a risky position those hedge funds were in. And we thought, 'We can exploit that. This is an opportunity.'\" In the ensuing mania, amateur investors drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Alex did well out of the deal, investing $1,000 in GameStop shares and making $2,000 profit on top of that. But he was one of the fortunate ones who got out in time. \"The theory was that as the price continued to go up, the people who shorted the stock would be forced to buy those shares at whatever price to close their short,\" he says. But as the activity drew regulatory attention this week, retail investors found themselves suddenly shut out by their trading platforms, unable to keep buying shares in GameStop and certain other companies. \"They assume we retail investors can't manage our risk, whereas hedge funds have taken a huge risk, an unbelievable risk, and they're just allowed to carry on, business as usual,\" says Alex. Although Alex emerged financially unscathed, he is still smarting at what he sees as injustice. \"There's a huge gap between ordinary middle-class, working-class people versus hedge funds that have billions,\" he says. \"Other people are hurting from this a lot more than me.\" 'Not a free market' Eighteen-year-old Myron Sakkas,of Coventry, who is studying at Warwick University, lost £30 on GameStop shares, which he owned for \"a couple of hours\" and sold when he saw what was happening.

But for now, he is disillusioned by what he sees as \"market manipulation\" directed against people like him. For him, there was a definite target in the GameStop share wars: as he puts it, \"the people that were responsible for [the financial crisis of] 2008 and were never held responsible\". \"We understand that there are risks, but this wasn't an actual crash. It was caused by people protecting corporate interests and normal people lost again. \"When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,\" he told the BBC. \"They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money.\" Myron says he has been locked out of his account and is unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the £1,000 he has in it and call a halt. \"Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,\" he says. \"I've got other stuff to do.\" 'It doesn't seem right' On social media, investors rallied their fellow traders, urging them to hold onto shares to avoid further losses, while attacking the platforms for the restrictions. Melissa Holdren, a 43-year-old nurse who lives in the US state of Massachusetts, was so angry about the clampdown by the trading platforms that it spurred her to buy into one of the companies affected. She used her account at Fidelity, a major brokerage known for its mutual funds, to purchase about $500 worth of shares in AMC Entertainment, which like GameStop has had its share purchases restricted by some brokerages. It was a first for the 43-year-old nurse, who has always relied on big companies to manage her retirement investments for her. \"I find it very questionable that a private corporation could one-way block the purchases of stock,\" she says. \"It doesn't seem right. If you're worried about market volatility why are you only blocking one side of the transactions?\" Melissa, whose grandfather made his living as an independent stock trader, says she knows she could lose money if AMC's stock falls. But she is hoping her small investment will help the AMC movie theatre chain survive - while taking a stand against Wall Street. \"In general we need to rethink a lot of our financial structures,\" she says. \"After the 2008 crash... it became made it clear that a lot of the financial market was divorced from reality in a way that I don't think is healthy\", she said. \"To be specifically concerned with what's going on on Reddit right now and not be concerned about that larger picture I think is specious.\"", "summary": "Jusqu'au début de la pandémie, Alex Patton n'avait jamais pensé qu'il pouvait devenir un trader amateur."}

Some of those targeted \"appeared to be underage\", the report by intelligence company Sensity said. But those running the service said it was simply \"entertainment\". The BBC has tested the software and received poor results. Sensity claim the technology used is a \"deepfake bot\". Deepfakes are computer-generated, often realistic images and video, based on a real template. One of its uses has been to create faked pornographic video clips of celebrities. But Sensity's chief executive Giorgio Patrini said the shift to using photos of private individuals is relatively new. \"Having a social media account with public photos is enough for anyone to become a target,\" he warned. Telegram bot The artificial intelligence-powered bot lives inside a Telegram private messaging channel. Users can send the bot a photo of a woman, and it will digitally remove her clothes in minutes, at no cost. The BBC tested multiple images, all with the subjects' consent, and none were completely realistic - our results included a photo of a woman with a belly button on her diaphragm. A similar app was shut down last year, but it is believed there are cracked versions of the software in circulation. The administrator running the service, known only as \"P\" said: \"I don't care that much. This is entertainment that does not carry violence. \"No one will blackmail anyone with this, since the quality is unrealistic.\" He also said the team looks at what photos are shared, and \"when we see minors we block the user for good.\" But the decision on whether to share the photo with others is up to whoever used the bot to create it in the first place, he said. Defending its relative level of harm, he added: \"There are wars, diseases, many bad things that are harmful in the world.\" He has also claimed he will soon remove all of the images. Telegram has not responded to a request for comment. 'Paedophilic content' Sensity reported that between July 2019 and 2020, approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had fake naked images of them shared publicly. Its investigation found that some of the images appeared underage, \"suggesting that some users were primarily using the bot to generate and share paedophilic content.\" Sensity said the bot has had significant advertising on the Russian social media site VK, and a survey on the platform showed that most users were from Russia and ex-USSR countries. But VK said: \"It doesn't tolerate such content or links on the platform and blocks communities that distribute them.\" Telegram was officially banned in Russia until earlier this year. \"Many of these websites or apps do not hide or operate underground, because they are not strictly outlawed,\" said Sensity's Giorgio Patrini. \"Until that happens, I am afraid it will only get worse.\" The authors of the report say they have shared all their findings with Telegram, VK and relevant law enforcement agencies, but have not had a response. Nina Schick, author of the book Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse, said deepfake creators were all over the world, and that legal protections were \"playing catch-up\" with the technology. \"It's only a matter of time until that content becomes more sophisticated. The number of deepfake porn videos seems to be doubling every six months,\" she said. \"Our legal systems are not fit for purpose on this issue. Society is changing quicker than we can imagine due to these exponential technological advances, and we as a society haven't decided how to regulate this. \"It's devastating, for victims of fake porn. It can completely upend their life because they feel violated and humiliated.\" Last year the US state of Virginia became one of the first places to outlaw deepfakes The current UK law around fake nude images has recently been criticised for being \"inconsistent, out-of-date and confusing\" in a university report. Despite progress on issues like revenge porn and upskirting, \"there remain many glaring gaps in the law\", says Lucy Hadley of the Women's Aid charity. While these statistics show how widespread deep-fake images can be, it is not currently a specific offence. The government has instructed the Law Commission to review the law around the issue in England and Wales. Its findings are due in 2021.", "summary": "De fausses images de nus de plus de 100 000 femmes ont été créées à partir de photos partagées sur les réseaux sociaux et publiées en ligne."}

Now Mr Lyon and his wife have their own company in Brisbane and he says he would be perfectly happy if two of his employees fell in love. \"It wouldn't bother me in the slightest,\" he says, \"as long as it didn't affect their work.\" Mr Lyon contacted the BBC after reading that McDonald's had fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he had a relationship with an employee. The US fast food giant said the relationship was consensual, but Mr Easterbrook had \"violated company policy\" and shown \"poor judgement\". The issue has shed light on the difficulties that staff can face if they find romance at work, especially if one is more senior than the other. 'Hammer dropped' In Mr Lyon's case, he was an operations manager at a firm making doors and windows. He met the future Mrs Lyon when she joined his team as a project co-ordinator. After three or four months, they got together at an office function. \"I always liked her and she made it known that she liked me as well,\" he said. \"It went from there.\" At the time, he was 41 and she was 14 years younger. They initially kept the relationship secret, but eventually made it known that they were an item. \"You don't believe it's an issue for other people, but it transpires that it is, and you don't see why, because it doesn't impact your work,\" he says. \"You spend a lot of time with people at work, so you get to know them quite well.\" After the couple had been seeing each other for about three months, he was called in and, as he puts it: \"Then the hammer dropped.\" He lost his job, but she kept hers. \"She was pretty upset, but there's not much you can do. You've just got to keep going.\" Mr Lyon says there was no clear workplace code in place about dating colleagues. He describes the decision as \"very arbitrary\" and says it represents \"a very archaic view of the world\". \"Should managers be banned from dating subordinates? Not if it is consensual,\" he says. \"You can't choose where you find love, so why penalise both parties by firing one of them?\" Human passions According to various studies, between a quarter and a third of all long-term relationships start at work. But of course, not all liaisons between co-workers are long-term. Some are flings, affairs, one-night stands - whatever you want to call them. And a number of high-profile cases serve as a reminder of just how tricky life can get when human passions collide with corporate culture: At the same time, the sexual harassment allegations against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein have made HR departments wary of any sexual activity between staff, especially in the US. However, Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says only a minority of employers have specific stand-alone policies on relationships at work. \"Most employers tend to take a different approach,\" he says. \"They will have policies on dignity and respect at work and preventing bullying and sexual harassment, setting out clear policies for dealing with complaints about inappropriate behaviour.\" Mr Willmott points out that under the Human Rights Act in the UK, employees have a right to privacy and a family life, so firms need to strike a balance. \"If you have a very prescriptive approach, it can suggest that you don't trust your employees to act as adults in the workplace,\" he says. Amorous advances Of course, there is the potential for conflicts of interest if staff are not careful. \"If one of the parties in the relationship is responsible for the other's appraisals, pay reviews, promotion opportunities and even work allocation, then there is danger of favouritism and from team members, perceived bias,\" says Rebecca Thornley-Gibson, partner at City of London law firm DMH Stallard. \"There may also be issues where the more junior employee feels as though they cannot say no to amorous advances, and this creates a real risk of later sexual harassment claims against the manager and employer.\" Stopping relationships is not likely to be practical for employers, she says, but having policies to minimise any fallout from the relationship should be considered. \"This will involve having in place and communicating workplace policies on conduct at work, equality and diversity policies with a clear zero-tolerance towards sexual harassment, and also requiring employees to declare relationships that are likely to result in a potential conflict.\"", "summary": "L'homme d'affaires australien Gary Lyon continue de trouver \"bizarre\" d'avoir perdu son poste de cadre supérieur pour être tombé amoureux d'une jeune collègue."}

The lovers, who were in their early thirties, hailed from Okija in south-eastern Anambra state, where slavery was officially abolished in the early 1900s, as in the rest of the country, by the UK, Nigeria's colonial ruler at the time. But descendants of freed slaves among the Igbo ethnic group still inherit the status of their ancestors and they are forbidden by local culture from marrying those Igbos seen as \"freeborn\". \"God created everyone equally so why would human beings discriminate just because of the ignorance of our forefathers,\" the couple said. Many Igbo couples come across such unexpected discrimination. Three years ago Favour, 35, who prefers not to use her surname, was preparing for her wedding to a man she had dated for five years, when his Igbo family discovered that she was the descendant of a slave. \"They told their son that they didn't want anything to do with me,\" said Favour, who is also Igbo. At first, her fiancé was defiant, but the pressure from his parents and siblings soon wore him down and he ended their romance. \"I felt bad. I was so hurt. I was so pained,\" she said. Prosperous but 'inferior' Marriage is not the only barrier slave descendants face. They are also banned from traditional leadership positions and elite groups, and often prevented from running for political office and representing their communities in parliament. However, they are not hindered from education or economic advancement. The ostracism often pushed them to more quickly embrace the Christianity and formal education brought by missionaries, at a time when other locals were still suspicious of the foreigners. Some slave descendants are today among the most prosperous in their communities, but no matter how much they achieve, they are still treated as inferior. In 2017, 44-year-old Oge Maduagwu founded the Initiative for the Eradication of Traditional and Cultural Stigmatisation in our Society (Ifetacsios). For the past three years, she has been travelling across the five states of south-eastern Nigeria, advocating equal rights for descendants of slaves. \"The kind of suffering that the black people are going through in America, the slave descendants here are also going through the same,\" she said. Ms Maduagwu is not a slave descendant, but she observed the inequality while growing up in Imo state and was moved to tackle it after watching the devastation of her close friend who was prevented from marrying a slave descendant. During her trips, Ms Maduagwu meets separately traditional persons of influence and slave descendants, then mediates dialogue sessions between the two groups. \"Men sat down to make these rules,\" she said. \"We can also sit down and remake the rules.\" Descendants of slaves among the Igbo fall into two main categories - the ohu and the osu. The ohu's ancestors were owned by humans, while the osu's were owned by gods - people dedicated to community shrines. \"Osu is worse than slavery,\" said Ugo Nwokeji, a professor of African studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who thinks the osu were wrongly classified as slaves by the missionaries. \"Slaves could transcend slavery and became slave masters themselves but the osu for generations unborn could never transcend that.\" Nigeria's Igbo heartland: Discrimination against the osu does tend to be worse. While the ohu are marginalised as outsiders - with no known places of origin or ageless ties to the lands where their ancestors were brought as slaves - breaking taboos about relations with the osu is accompanied, not just by fear of social stigma, but of punishment by the gods who supposedly own them. Favour's fiancé was told by his father that his life would be cut short if he married her, an osu. \"They instilled fear in him,\" she said. \"He asked me if I wanted him to die.\" 'Grassroots engagement' Such fears have made it difficult to enforce laws against discrimination which exist in the Nigerian constitution, plus a 1956 law by Igbo lawmakers specifically banning discrimination against ohu or osu. \"Legal proscriptions are not enough to abolish certain primordial customs,\" said Anthony Obinna, an Catholic archbishop in Imo state, who advocates for an end to the discrimination. \"You need more grassroots engagement.\" In her advocacy, Ms Maduagwu educates people on the various ways in which traditional guidelines on relating with the osu have been breached, \"without the gods wreaking any havoc\". \"Today, we are tenants in their houses, we are on their payroll, we go to borrow money from them,\" she said. Such association with the osu would have been unthinkable in the past. No official data exists on the number of slave descendants in south-eastern Nigeria. People tend to hide their status, although this is impossible in smaller communities where everyone's lineage is known. Some communities have only ohu or osu, while some have both. In recent years, increasing agitation from ohu and osu has led to conflict and unrest in many communities. Some slave descendants have started parallel societies with their own leadership and elite groups. You may also be interested in: About 13 years ago, the osu in Imo state formed a group called Nneji, which means \"from the same womb\". Among the benefits that Nneji offers its thousands of members is arranging marriages between their adult children in different parts of the world, saving them the potential heartbreak of relationships with \"freeborn\". \"People come to you when they want a favour from you,\" said Ogadinma, a septuagenarian from a wealthy osu family, whose husband is a patron of the Nneji. \"But those same people, when your children want to marry their children, they complain that the person is osu.\" Archbishop Obinna, who has been criticised for officiating at the weddings of what he describes as \"mixed couples\", said: \"I have had to safeguard some of the couples from the violence of their parents and relatives.\" Ogadinma, who also asked me not to use her surname to protect her family, faced discrimination when she ran for political office about 10 years ago. Petitions poured in from people who said that she was \"unsuitable\" to contest - and the national leader of her party, who was Yoruba, found it difficult to support her, convinced that she stood no chance. \"He told me plainly: 'There is something Igbo people say that you are, which will not allow your people to vote for you.'\" Discrimination based on slave caste is not common among the Yoruba or Hausa, Nigeria's two other major ethnic groups. But it has been reported among some ethnic groups in other West African countries, such as Mali and Senegal. Ms Maduagwu's Ifetacsios group now has four staff and about a dozen volunteers. The work has been slow and hard, but a handful of traditional rulers have embarked on the process of abolishing the inequality in their communities. She says she was initially shocked by the attacks on social media from people opposed to her activism. \"I had to join a lot of Igbo groups to spread the message and a lot of them insulted me and told me that their tradition will remain.\" Nollywood factor Such attitudes even among the educated and enlightened are perpetuated by African literature such as late Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Ogadinma believes. \"He was a person dedicated to a god, a thing set apart - a taboo for ever, and his children after him,\" Achebe, who was Igbo, wrote of the osu in his 1958 classic. \"He could neither marry nor be married by the freeborn… An osu could not attend an assembly of the freeborn, and they, in turn, could not shelter under his roof... When he died he was buried by his kind in the Evil Forest.\" Ogadinma worries that Nigerian students around the world who read the novel as part of their curriculum subconsciously adopt traditional beliefs about the osu. \"If every generation of Nigerian children is reading about this osu, don't you think it will affect their thinking?\" she said. Nollywood also plays a part, according to Aloysius Agbo, an Anglican bishop in Enugu state, who advocates for an end to the discrimination. Nigerian films have their dedicated TV channels, including the wildly popular Africa Magic. \"Beliefs that we already accepted as superstitious are now coming back as real truths because of what we watch on Africa Magic,\" said Bishop Agbo. \"They do it as showcasing our culture but they are not conscious of the impact on society.\" But with the recent Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests around the world, Ms Maduagwu hopes that more Igbo people will be inspired to change their attitudes. \"If more people will reflect that the agonising journey of the black Americans began here, the BLM protests will affect our work positively,\" Ms Maduagwu said. \"Africans need to look inwardly to see what is happening in their homeland.\" Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani is journalist and novelist based in Abuja", "summary": "Dans une tragédie qui rappelle Roméo et Juliette, un couple au Nigeria s'est suicidé au début du mois après que leurs parents leur ont interdit de se marier parce que l'un d'eux était un descendant d'esclaves."}

The Chang'e-5 mission is China's third successful Moon landing in seven years. Ms Zhou was in charge of the rocket connector system - described as a pivotal role. The young astronaut has been a trending topic on Weibo since Chinese state media highlighted her as one of the women involved in the successful launch of the Chang'e-5 lunar probe on 23 November. Her story in particular has resonated with the public given her young age. Social media users have been celebrating her \"brilliance\" and referring to her as a \"source of pride\" for the country. Several people jokingly reflected on their own achievements, commenting how far behind in life they were in comparison. The huge amount of interest in the Guizhou Province native has not appeared to have had much of an effect on her, however. According to news site Duocai Guizhou Net, Ms Zhou declined repeated requests for interviews as she does not wish to let fame get in the way of her work. The aim of the Chang'e-5 - named after the Chinese moon goddess - is to gather lunar rocks and soil to help scientists learn more about the moon's formations. If successful, it would be the first in more than 40 years to bring lunar samples back to Earth, and will make China the third country to do so after the United States and the Soviet Union. The mission is part of Beijing's push to become a space superpower, with the Chinese state media casting the \"space dream\" - as President Xi Jinping calls it - as one step in the path to \"national rejuvenation\". For China, space exploration is seen as a way to display its growing technological might, as well as to demonstrate itself as a force to be reckoned with on the world stage. Prof Ouyang Ziyuan, one of the country's top scientists, told China's official newspaper People's Daily back in 2006: \"Lunar exploration is a reflection of a country's comprehensive national power.\" Last year, China became the first country to successfully land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the moon. In the next few decades, it plans to build a research station on the Moon and send people to Mars. Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst Most Chinese know the story of the mythological Chang'e, the Chinese goddess of the moon. It's a story not dissimilar to Romeo & Juliet - about a woman who drinks an immortality potion, accidentally leaving none for her husband, and weightlessly, flying to the moon so she can stay close to him until he dies. It is told every year during China's Mid-Autumn/Moon Festival, and so people can't hear the word \"Chang'e\" without conjuring up romantic images of a moon goddess. For this reason, China's mission to the moon was calling out for a strong female figure. And so pictures of 24-year-old Zhou Chengyu have been all over state media, with comments about how she is a \"frontline soldier in the field of aerospace\" and a \"big sister\" that young Chinese can look up to. China has been increasingly trying to highlight strong female figures in the country. The country's top leadership is extremely male-dominated, but in November, national newspaper Global Times invited netizens to comment on the year's achievements by women like medical scientist Chen Wei, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, and UFC fighter Zhang Weili. But many in China feel that the role of women in the country is still underplayed, in many industries. This was a big talking point in September, when a TV drama highlighting women's roles in China's Covid-19 fight was widely viewed as sexist.", "summary": "Une femme de 24 ans, commandant de l'espace.

The mother of two found out she was pregnant a few weeks later, after moving from her native Bahia to Minas Gerais, a nearby state, for work. \"I didn't know what to do,\" recalls Paloma. \"The only thing I was certain of was that I didn't want this child.\" Brazil has strict laws on abortion. Terminations are only allowed in cases of rape, when the mother's life is at risk or when the foetus has the defect anencephaly - a rare condition that prevents part of the brain and skull from developing. While Paloma was entitled to an abortion by law, like many women in Brazil, she was not entirely clear on her rights. She worried she would have to report the rape to the police in order to access a legal abortion - a tactic commonly used to steer women away from the procedure. But she feared retaliation from her rapist. \"I was really worried about the safety of my children,\" she explains as her decision to save up for a clandestine termination. Clandestine abortions are risky: when performed without sound medical oversight, they can lead to complications and endanger women's lives. If found out, women can also face up to four years in jail. But Paloma did not know where else to turn and started saving the 3,700 reais ($660; £515) she needed for the clandestine procedure - a sum that is over three times Brazil's minimum monthly salary. A doctor was going to fly in from Rio de Janeiro, over 900km (560 miles) away from her new home in Minas Gerais, to perform the termination. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic paralysed Brazil, shutting airports, bus stations and health centres. By late April, Paloma was over 23 weeks pregnant. \"When everything closed, it became really difficult to travel - it all became so complicated,\" she recalls. With the process dogged by delays, Paloma turned to the internet in search of options one last time. She stumbled upon Milhas pela Vida das Mulheres, a network helping women access safe abortions. The group helped her understand her rights and pointed her to one of the few legal abortion clinics still operating during the pandemic. For Paloma, it was a fortuitous turn of events. \"I was going to risk my life and I may not have been alive today,\" she says of the clandestine abortion she was planning to have. Curbed access Many Brazilian women have not had the same luck as Paloma during the pandemic. Early on, the crisis sharply curtailed access to legal terminations as many abortion clinics shuttered. Data collected by activists suggests that, of the 76 registered clinics providing legal abortion across Brazil, only 42 remained open during the pandemic. Abortion in Latin America One of them is Nuavidas, the health hub in Uberlândia assisting victims of sexual violence where Paloma's abortion was performed. \"The pandemic became an excuse to unravel the rights of women,\" says obstetrician Dr Helena Paro, the co-ordinator of Nuavidas. Sandra Leite is the co-ordinator of a centre for female victims of violence at Recife Women's Hospital, which also remained open during the pandemic. She says the pandemic made it more difficult for vulnerable women to reach a clinic. During quarantine, \"women had more difficulty leaving the house\" to seek help, she says. \"And in some cases, their attackers were inside the house with them, so they couldn't seek healthcare.\" She says the centre where she works saw a decline in patients, even though it was one of the few to remain open. But she says that now that lockdown restrictions have eased, demand for legal abortions has increased. \"We're seeing that women have suffered more violence while in isolation at home with their aggressors,\" Ms Leite says. Arbitrary limits At Dr Paro's clinic, the number of women seeking legal abortions has doubled recently. And many women - like Paloma - are arriving with more advanced pregnancies, likely because they could not seek or access help during the pandemic. \"At times, these women have had to travel long distances to access this right,\" Dr Paro says. \"And that's often why they're arriving with more advanced pregnancies.\" This could pose yet another barrier for women. Abortions after 22 weeks are controversial and Brazil's health ministry advises against them, citing heightened risks for the mother's health. Dr Paro says that while the 22-week limit is \"not based in science\" nor enshrined in Brazilian law, most clinics refuse to carry out the procedure beyond that point. Dr Paro's clinic is one of just a couple of facilities across Brazil that perform abortions beyond 22 weeks. She calls the 22 weeks an \"arbitrary limit\" which she argues many doctors use as \"an excuse to refuse an abortion that they are already against\". \"So if a woman passes [22 weeks], she will have huge difficulty finding an abortion clinic in Brazil today\" to perform a termination, Dr Paro explains. Further blow Even before Covid-19 struck Brazil, abortion rights were coming under attack. With few clinics across the vast country, most women already struggled to access legal abortions, says Gabriela Rondon, a researcher and lawyer with Anis, an organisation promoting women's rights. In the poorer north, there are just two clinics for a region of over 17 million people. \"Many women don't have a clinic nearby, especially women in rural areas,\" Ms Rondon says. \"And there's also a lack of information - oftentimes, women are not told they have this right.\" She adds that in practice, many clinics say they offer the service but instead \"employ a series of barriers, which either delay accessing an abortion or make it impossible\". When women do reach a clinic offering legal abortions, they are often treated with hostility or aggressively questioned. Some are turned away by doctors who refuse to carry out abortions on \"conscientious\" grounds. Women seeking a termination are now facing a new hurdle too. In August, the government released new guidelines instructing clinics to report cases of rape to police - even when victims do not want to. Ms Leite believes the guidance will discourage women who have been raped from seeking abortions they are entitled to by law. \"All of this work that was done over the years - today we're seeing it crumble.\" You may want to watch:", "summary": "Paloma venait de rassembler assez d'argent pour un avortement clandestin lorsque la pandémie de coronavirus est venu confiner une grande partie du Brésil."}

Liechtenstein is not the only European country to recover Nigerian state funds, with Switzerland so far returning some $700m. Earlier this year, the US froze some $458m hidden by Abacha in bank accounts in Jersey and France. Abacha seized power shortly after the 1993 elections were annulled and went on to become one of Nigeria's most notorious military rulers, accused of stealing billions of dollars from the oil-rich nation.", "summary": "Le Liechtenstein va rendre 167 millions d'euros au Nigeria, que l'ancien dirigeant militaire Sani Abacha aurait détournés dans les années 1990, selon le ministère des finances du pays africain."}

The 76-year-old's time at the top has been accompanied by a long period of peace and big developmental changes for which many are grateful. But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents. During the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of him stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\" For this revolutionary the harvest is still not over. My introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out. The piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings. It is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity. Presidential press-ups He is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure. Many young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language). But the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around. In his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the last election, he has been traversing the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets. And with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni has been keen to show his vitality. Last April, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November. \"If your father loves you, he has to empower you. In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern. The economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power. Presidential age limits overturned One of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty. \"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says. \"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent… he is an Africanist.\" 14 January 2021 18.1mpeople have registered to vote 11candidates are running for president 1of the candidates is a woman, Nancy Kalembe 5elected terms so far for Yoweri Museveni 50% plus 1votes needed for a candidate to avoid a run-off election 529MPs will also be elected Nevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005. Indeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm. Journalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life. \"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote. But something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits. He had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age. And then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building. Many saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life. It is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president. Fewer challenges to authority The significance of patronage extends right through society. It sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution. But his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years. \"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council. While acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\". Despite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority. The judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government. When judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities. For example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges. \"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple. When it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment. Find out more about the Ugandan elections: The media has also had its independence threatened. On the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni. \"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala. But outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds. But perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered. Opposition supporters shot dead As it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents. Kizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, once Mr Museveni's physician, first ran against him in the 2001 election. He has been detained and prosecuted on numerous charges, including rape and treason, but has never been convicted. Now that Bobi Wine, a singer whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is mounting a serious challenge to the president's rule, he has become the latest politician to face the wrath of the men in uniform. The MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped. On the campaign trail for this election, the police have arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups. During two days of protests in November following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces. Sticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face. Through his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself. Whereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath.", "summary": "Les Ougandais de moins de 35 ans - soit plus des trois quarts de la population - n'ont connu qu'un seul président."}

But experts have questioned whether it has undergone the necessary testing. The Venezuelan government, which has received billions of dollars in loans from Russia, said it would be willing to take part in clinical trials. Call for volunteers \"In the coming days, we'll be asking for volunteers to get vaccinated,\" President Maduro announced on Sunday. Russian scientists had said early-stage trials of their vaccine were a success - although the vaccine's approval by regulators comes before the completion of a larger study involving thousands of people. Mr Maduro's statement indicates that Venezuela does not have the volunteers yet, suggesting that Health Minister Carlos Alvarado jumped the gun when he said 10 days ago that Venezuela had offered Russia \"500 volunteers to participate in vaccine trials\". The Venezuelan government has also said that it was ready to participate in testing of Chinese and Cuban vaccines against Covid-19. More about coronavirus vaccines: China and Cuba, along with Russia, are staunch allies of Nicolás Maduro, whose government has been increasingly isolated after more than 50 nations, including the US and UK, have recognised his rival Juan Guaidó as the interim president. Mr Guaidó, who leads the National Assembly - the only institution in Venezuela to be controlled by the opposition - declared himself acting president in January 2019 after the election which had returned Mr Maduro to power was widely deemed to be neither free nor fair. Mr Maduro, who has the support of the security forces, has remained in the presidential palace and largely in control of the country, but US sanctions have left his government reliant on loans from Russia and his other remaining allies. After Russia announced it had registered the Covid-19 vaccine, which it has named Sputnik V, Mr Maduro congratulated it on its achievement. He also said on that he would be the first to get inoculated. \"The first one to be vaccinated will be me. I'm going to get the vaccine, I'm going to set an example,\" he said on 16 August. However, speaking on Sunday, he did not say whether he would be among the 500 Venezuelan volunteers. Venezuela has fewer than 50,000 registered cases of coronavirus and 381 deaths, a much lower toll than other countries in the region. But immunologists say the true figure could be much higher as many Venezuelans do not get tested for fear of being stigmatised after the government blamed returning migrants for the spread of Covid-19.

Opposition political parties have joined together to organise demonstrations, but theirs has not been the decisive voice that has repeatedly brought tens of thousands out on to the streets in a display of public anger unprecedented for decades - and which has now forced Mr Keïta and his ministers to negotiate. The real mobiliser - the figure who wields the critical crowd pulling power - is an imam, Mahmoud Dicko. He is the central player in this challenge to a president who looks complacent and bereft of energy and ideas in the face of the huge problems that continue to pile up for Mali, despite the presence of close to 15,000 international troops and constant injections of external aid. Imam Dicko is no novice emerging from a discreet life of spiritual leadership in the mainly Muslim nation. Power stretches to Timbuktu He has been a major player in public life for at least a decade, but today more than ever he is demonstrating his clout. In April 2019 he organised protests that forced the sacking of then prime minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maïga. This year's huge protest, on 5 June during Friday prayers, was confined to the capital Bamako and Sikasso, a city in the south. But two weeks later crowds were also out in Kayes in the west, Ségou in south-central and even in the ancient desert city of Timbuktu, on the fringes of the Sahara. And the movement could spread further still. It is Imam Dicko's mobilising power that has given negotiating muscle to his conventional political allies. On Tuesday leaders of Mr Keïta's governing camp sat down for talks with M5, the opposition alliance. But two days previously they had first met the imam, aware that he has the popular reach that may be decisive. 'Reverence for mysticism' International mediators too - from the UN peacekeeping mission to Mali, the European Union (EU) and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) - have also taken care to sound out Imam Dicko. He came to prominence in 2009 as head of the High Islamic Council, leading a campaign of mass protest that forced Mali's then President Amadou Toumani Touré to water down a reform of family law that would have bolstered the rights of women. This confirmed his role as a prominent religious conservative. Born in the mid-1950s in the Timbuktu region, Imam Dicko was originally a teacher of Arabic, who studied in Saudi Arabia and became the religious leader of the mosque in Badalabogou, a leafy riverside suburb of Bamako. He was also secretary of the main government religious organisation until the end of the one-party regime and establishment of democracy almost three decades ago. Despite his Saudi education, Imam Dicko never espoused the kingdom's austere and fundamentalist Wahabi interpretation of Islam. He is really an advocate of traditionalist West African Islam, conservative in his view of family issues but a strong defender of Mali's pre-Muslim cultural roots and pluralistic religious culture and reverence for mysticism. Timbuktu, for example, is known as \"the city of 333 saints\". Imam Dicko has always opposed both the imposition of harsh physical punishments in the name of Islam and the ideology of violent jihad. When Islamist militants took over the north of Mali in 2012, he tried to reach a solution through talks, even meeting jihadist commander Iyad Ag Ghaly. And when the militants abandoned dialogue and launched a new offensive, threatening to break through to the south and advance towards Bamako, Imam Dicko welcomed France's military intervention of January 2013, arguing that its soldiers were rescuing Malians who were \"in distress\" after being abandoned by fellow Muslim countries. Formed his own Islamist movement Yet for Imam Dicko, welcoming the French intervention that saved Bamako from the jihadists never meant also buying into some wider liberal modernity agenda. He has always defended social conservatism, sometimes in graphic language. Yet he has always stuck to his conservatism. He said the militants responsible for a 2015 attack on the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako had been sent by God to punish Malians for homosexuality, imported from the West. And his nationalist sentiments show through when he accuses France of ambitions to re-colonise his country. In that he is like many compatriots - delighted to be rescued back in 2013 but now tiring of a French military operation that has still not managed to shut down the jihadist armed groups. Today it is this populist appeal that makes him such an influential player in the current political crisis. Back in the 2013 election he endorsed Mr Keïta, who was running for president on a waffly slogan of restoring national pride after the crisis of the previous two years. Both that contest and the next, in 2018, saw Mr Keïta crush his much more technocratic challenger, Soumaïla Cissé. But today the president is under political siege while Mr Cissé is a hostage in the hands of jihadist militants, after being kidnapped on the rural campaign trail for parliamentary elections this March. More about Mali's battle against jihadis As for Imam Dicko, he abandoned President Keïta in 2017 and last year stepped down from the High Islamic Council to form his own Islamist political movement, the Coordination des Mouvements, Associations et Sympathisants (CMAS). He has been involved in attempts to develop a new dialogue with Ag Ghaly and other jihadist leaders still pursuing the armed struggle, an avenue that Mr Keïta is also attempting to pursue. 'Standard bearer of nationalism' But Imam Dicko's political rift with the president remains profound. His opposition allies are secular and the current protests are fuelled by anger at all the things that have gone wrong rather than any broad popular appetite for transforming Mali into an Islamic republic. Besides the relentless security crisis across the north, there have been a string of corruption scandals, while a teachers' strike had already shut many schools long before the virus lockdown. There seems little chance that Mr Keïta, re-elected in 2018 with a solid mandate, will be prepared to just quit. But he might agree to retreat into a more titular role, while the opposition joins a unity government that moves real power out of his hands. Whatever happens, terms limits bar the president standing again in 2023. Could that leave the field open for Imam Dicko to emerge as the standard bearer of a nationalist tradition exasperated with the deal-making of the conventional political class?", "summary": "En dépit des inquiétudes suscitées par le coronavirus, des foules immenses soutiennent une campagne de manifestations de masse dans tout le Mali.

His organisation was set up after the Ebola epidemic of 2014, when a vaccine was developed, but too late to have any impact on the outbreak. With more than $750m (£571m) from governments and organisations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, it is funding promising new vaccine technologies. In particular, CEPI wants vaccines that can be produced quickly. \"In most circumstances that we have an epidemic, speed becomes really, really important,\" Mr Hatchett says. Traditionally, vaccines are made by taking the original virus or bacteria and disabling it in some way. The idea is to degrade the microbe so that it is no longer a health threat, but can still trigger a response from immune system. The body can then use that immune response if it ever comes into contact with the real infection. That kind of approach has been terrifically successful, saving millions of lives. The trouble is that developing and manufacturing vaccines that way is slow and expensive. Frederic Garzoni is one of many scientists hoping to change all that. He spent years in France working on proteins, examining and tweaking the building blocks of bodies. But in 2016 he came across something he thinks is very special. A protein structure that self-assembles into a football-like molecule, that can be easily manipulated and be produced in large quantities, and can perhaps be used to vaccinate against a host of diseases. More Technology of Business \"I thought that is the best protein I have seen in 15 years. I'm quitting my job and I'm going to focus on this,\" he said. Mr Garzoni, and others, are manipulating all sorts of microbes, often at the level of DNA, to make particles that spur the immune system into action. His research has been helped by powerful tools, including cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a procedure that lowers samples to extremely low temperatures and then bombards then with electrons. The resulting pictures render almost atomic detail, allowing scientists to identify useful properties, that would have been unknown before cryo-EM came along. At the University of Bristol, those images have been combined with powerful cloud-computing services provided by US tech giant Oracle, which allow detailed pictures to be created more quickly and cheaply than ever before. With that kind of detail, researchers can identify all sorts of useful properties. There are dozens of different research groups developing new technologies to create vaccines in different ways. Jon Cuccui is an associate professor of microbiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His research has focused on vaccines to tackle bacterial infections. The approach has been to use a safe strain of the escherichia ecoli bacterium as a molecular factory to produce a sugar-protein complex, that can train the host to recognise many dangerous infections. \"You end up with an infinite quantity of vaccine, that is scaleable... and therefore much cheaper to produce,\" he said. Several vaccines produced using this technology are already in clinical trials. Mr Cuccui says the ability to quickly determine the genetic blueprint of an organism and then tweak that blueprint has made a big difference to his research. \"We can go and target an organism and develop a prototype vaccine at a much faster rate than we could 10 to 20 years ago.\" The long road to vaccine approval Once scientists have developed a promising vaccine, they conduct pre-clinical trials on mice and larger animals. That stage alone can take years of research. But if the treatment is promising then it will be tested on humans. Being able to develop and manufacture vaccines more cheaply is the goal of Mr Hatchett's organisation, CEPI. \"We don't want to just develop high-price vaccines that can only be afforded by the one percenters in the developed world... the epidemic diseases we are focused on are much more likely to emerge in lower and middle-income countries,\" he says. Giant pharmaceutical companies are some of the most important operators in the vaccine business. GSK is one of the biggest players in the field, making vaccines that protect against 21 diseases. \"This is a new golden age of vaccines as far as I'm concerned,\" says William \"Rip\" Ballou, head of US vaccine research at pharmaceuticals giant GSK. He is particularly excited about a technology, called self-amplifying mRNA (SAM), which starts with part of the genetic code of a virus, converting that into messenger RNA (molecules which carry instructions for the body about how to build proteins). Once injected into the body, the molecule can use the body's own systems to trigger an immune response to the original virus. Potentially it allows GSK to find candidate vaccines more quickly, which could be vital when responding to an outbreak. It could also revolutionise the way vaccines are manufactured. At the moment each vaccine has its own dedicated production line, but SAM could see the same equipment used to make different vaccines - which would be much cheaper and faster. \"This is really mind blowing technology,\" says Mr Ballou.", "summary": "\"Les maladies infectieuses évoluent beaucoup plus rapidement que nous et beaucoup plus rapidement que nos défenses''."}

But WHO vice-head Mariangela Simao said it was a \"very worrying trend\". Earlier WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said \"vaccine nationalism\" could lead to a \"protracted recovery\". Speaking at the Davos Agenda - a virtual version of the global summit - he said vaccine hoarding would \"keep the pandemic burning and... slow global economic recovery\", in addition to being a \"catastrophic moral failure\" that could further widen global inequality. What is the EU doing? The European Union is introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. The so-called transparency mechanism gives EU countries powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. \"The protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,\" the European Commission said. The controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt. However, the EU has been forced to backtrack on plans to impose restrictions on the export of vaccines across the border on the island of Ireland after outcry from Dublin and London. The EU insists its controls are a temporary scheme, not an export ban. Why is this happening now? The news comes with the EU in a very public dispute with drug-maker AstraZeneca over supplies, and under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution. Earlier on Friday the Commission made public a confidential contract with AstraZeneca, the UK-Swedish company behind the Oxford vaccine, to bolster its argument that the firm has been failing to fulfil its promises to deliver to the bloc. The contract stipulates that the pharmaceutical company would commit its \"best reasonable efforts\" to manufacture and distribute doses. AstraZeneca has blamed the delays on production glitches at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the late signing of contracts. Under the EU's new rule, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU. Its 27 member states will be able to vet those export applications. Vaccines produced by Pfizer in Belgium are currently being exported to the UK, and the EU insists that some of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in England is destined under contract for EU citizens. The EU is also in a supply dispute with Pfizer, which is set to fall short of the contracted vaccine volume for the EU by the end of March. Pfizer says the reason for that is the urgent expansion of its facility in Puurs, Belgium. Who is exempt from the export controls? The EU is allowing some 92 exemptions from the export control regime, including: vaccine donations to Covax, the global scheme to help poorer countries; and exports to Switzerland, countries in the western Balkans, Norway and North Africa. Other Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon and Israel are also exempt. But on Saturday WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the BBC vaccines should be given to all vulnerable groups and health workers across the globe before each country starts giving the jabs out more widely. This would mean wealthy nations, such as the UK, halting immunisations at home once priority groups had been vaccinated and instead helping with vaccinations elsewhere. \"We're asking all countries in those circumstances to do that - hang on, wait for those other groups. Rather than rushing to vaccinate one country, we need to be doing the lot and we need to be doing it together,\" she said. So far 95% of all vaccinations had taken place in just 10 countries, Ms Harris said, while only two low and middle income countries had even begun immunisation programmes. The EU is contracted to receive the following vaccine doses: Pressure grows as nations grow impatient The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says some EU governments are beginning to show impatience with Brussels, which had hoped its vaccination purchasing scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. The Commission's laboured negotiating process, the tardy approval of vaccines by the EU's medical regulator and delays now in vaccine deliveries have left EU citizens demanding answers and action, our correspondent says. Markus Söder, the Bavarian premier and Germany's possible future chancellor, told ZDF television on Friday that it was his impression that the commission \"ordered too late, and only bet on a few companies, they agreed on a price in a typically bureaucratic EU procedure and completely underestimated the fundamental importance of the situation.\" On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, describing it as \"quasi-ineffective\" for the over-65s. The claim was rejected by Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor who was part of the team behind the vaccine. \"I suspect this is a bit of demand management from Mr Macron,\" Sir John told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. Asked if he thought Mr Macron was trying to reduce demand for the jab, he added: \"Well, if he didn't have any vaccine the best thing you could do is reduce demand.\" The politics of vaccines in the EU Earlier this week the EU indicated this proposal was coming down the track. It would be a \"notification system\" officials said. Nothing more than a way of showing transparency. That has now turned into an export control policy, partly because of Germany's insistence that EU governments should be the ones to decide whether EU-based companies can export vaccines elsewhere. EU officials tell me that it's also been partly triggered by the deep suspicion of the \"vague justification\" given by AstraZeneca this week, when their chief executive insisted that the production problem was down to \"lower productivity\" at its Belgian plant. This new system of export control could well affect British vaccine deliveries. Pfizer currently dispatches doses from the Puurs site here to the UK. In future, Pfizer would have to fill in an export form and wait up to 48 hours for their export request to be accepted or rejected by the Belgian government. That decision would be based on whether the company could prove that taking that batch of vaccine to the UK would not affect the existing EU agreement.", "summary": "L'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) critique l'annonce par l'UE de contrôler l'exportation des vaccins produits au sein du bloc européen.

In the Catholic Church, a blessing is given by a priest or other minister in the name of the Church. On Monday, Pope Francis approved the response by the CDF, saying it was \"not intended to be a form of unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite\". Some parishes in recent months, including in Germany and the US, have started giving blessings to people in same-sex relationships as a way to welcome gay Catholics to the church, Reuters news agency reported. The CDF's response was in answer to the question posed to it: \"Does the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?\". It replied: \"Negative\". The CDF noted that marriage between a man and a woman is sacrament and therefore blessings cannot be extended to same-sex couples. \"For this reason, it is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex,\" it said. What has the reaction been? In defiant response, people posted photos from their same-sex weddings - including Chasten Buttigieg, husband of 2020 US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.

LGBTQ people are wonderfully made by God. We are born this way and perfectly so, regardless of what the Vatican or any other religious authority might claim.\" And Francis DeBernardo, executive director of gay Catholic group New Ways Ministry, said the Vatican's statement was \"not surprising, but still disappointing\".

Police had been called to check on the boy, who had ADHD, after his online posts prompted fears for his safety. A month after the shooting the county prosecutor announced the officer, Clayton Jenison, would not be charged. The FBI's Kansas City, Missouri, field office is working with the US Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and US attorney's office in Kansas on the inquiry. FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton said in a statement on Thursday that they would \"collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner\". Police dashcam video shows John reversing the family's van slowly out of the garage and down the driveway as officers arrive at the property in the city of Overland Park. An officer shouts: \"Stop!\" The vehicle continues to back out and Officer Jenison, standing from the side, fires two shots. The van reverses wildly in a sharp circle back towards the officer, before slowing almost to a stop. The officer steps aside and fires 11 more shots. The vehicle rolls forward and comes to a halt in a neighbour's front garden across the road. Severance payment A month after the shooting, Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced that his investigation had found the shooting was justified because the officer was determined to have feared for his life. Officer Jenison resigned weeks after the shooting and received a severance payment of $70,000 (£55,000). The boy's mother, Sheila Albers, sued Overland Park for violating her son's constitutional rights, and the city last year settled the wrongful death lawsuit for $2.3m. In a statement quoted by the Kansas City Star on Thursday, Ms Albers said: \"The FBI investigation highlights the failure of Overland Park and District Attorney Steve Howe to be transparent in their investigations and be accountable to their constituents. \"We are thankful to the FBI and the US Attorney for the district of Kansas for reopening the case and shed light on what Overland Park and our DA have been able to keep hidden.\" Sean Reilly, a spokesman for the city of Overland Park, said they would \"fully co-operate\" with the FBI inquiry. There was no immediate comment from the Overland Park Police Department or the Johnson County district attorney's Office. Transparency and accountability On the day he died, John told his parents he did not want to join them for dinner. After his family went out, the teenager made posts on social media that led friends to fear for his mental health. They called emergency services to check on his welfare. Mrs Albers told KCUR in Kansas City last year: \"We left the house at about 5:10 and John was dead by 5:50. \"If you were there to prevent a suicide, why would you draw your gun?\" Mrs Albers has since set up an advocacy group called JoCo United to press for more transparency and accountability from Johnson County officials and improved mental health services.", "summary": "Le FBI va enquêter sur les tirs mortels sur un adolescent alors qu'il faisait marche arrière pour sortir du garage familial dans l'État du Kansas, aux États-Unis."}

It is now being used to identify people at borders, unlock smart phones, spot criminals, and authenticate banking transactions. But some tech firms are claiming it can also assess our emotional state. Since the 1970s, psychologists say they have been able to detect hidden emotions by studying the \"micro expressions\" on someone's face in photographs and video. Algorithms and high definition cameras can handle this process just as accurately and faster, tech firms say. \"You're already seeing it used for commercial purposes,\" explains Oliver Philippou, an expert in video surveillance at IHS Markit. \"A supermarket might use it in the aisles, not to identify people, but to analyse who came in in terms of age and gender as well as their basic mood. It can help with targeted marketing and product placement.\" Market research agency Kantar Millward Brown uses tech developed by US firm Affectiva to assess how consumers react to TV adverts. Affectiva records video of people's faces - with their permission - then \"codes\" their expressions frame by frame to assess their mood. \"We interview people but we get much more nuance by also looking at their expressions. You can see exactly which part of an advert is working well and the emotional response triggered,\" says Graham Page, managing director of offer and innovation at Kantar Millward Brown. More controversially, a crop of start-ups are offering \"emotion detection\" for security purposes. UK firm WeSee, for example, claims its AI tech can actually spot suspicious behaviour by reading facial cues imperceptible to the untrained eye. Emotions, such as doubt and anger, might be hidden under the surface in contrast to the language a person is using. WeSee says it has been working with a \"high profile\" organisation in law enforcement to analyse people who are being interviewed. \"Using only low-quality video footage, our technology has the ability to determine an individual's state of mind or intent through their facial expressions, posture, gestures and movement,\" chief executive David Fulton tells the BBC. \"In future, video cameras on a tube station platform could use our tech to detect suspicious behaviour and alert authorities to a potential terrorist threat. \"The same could be done with crowds at events like football matches or political rallies.\" But Mr Philippou is sceptical about the accuracy of emotion detection. \"When it comes simply to identifying faces, there are still decent margins of error - the best firms claim they can identify people with 90%-92% accuracy. \"When you try assess emotions, too, the margin of error gets significantly bigger.\" That worries privacy campaigners who fear facial recognition tech could make wrong or biased judgements. \"While I can imagine that there are some genuinely useful use-cases, the privacy implications stemming from emotional surveillance, facial recognition and facial profiling are unprecedented,\" says Frederike Kaltheuner of Privacy International. Straightforward facial recognition is controversial enough. When revellers attended BBC Radio 1's Biggest Weekend in Swansea in May, many will have been unaware that their faces were being scanned as part of a huge surveillance operation by South Wales Police. The force had deployed its Automated Facial Recognition (AFR) system, which uses CCTV-type cameras and NEC software to identify \"people of interest\", comparing their faces to a database of custody images. One man on an outstanding warrant was identified and arrested \"within 10 minutes\" of the tech being deployed at the music festival, says Scott Lloyd, the AFR project leader for South Wales Police. But human rights group Liberty points out that the tech has yielded large numbers of \"false positive\" matches at other events, such as the Champions League final in Cardiff last year. And in July, Cardiff resident Ed Bridges - represented by Liberty - began legal action against the force, arguing that AFR violated people's privacy and lacked proper scrutiny, paving the way for a High Court battle. But the technology is becoming more reliable, says Patrick Grother, head of biometric testing at the National Institute of Standards & Technology, a US federal agency that conducts research into facial recognition. He attributes the recent technological progress to the development of \"convolutional neural networks\" - an advanced form of machine learning that enables a much greater degree of accuracy. \"These algorithms allow computers to analyse images at different scales and angles,\" he says. \"You can identify faces much more accurately, even if they are partially obscured by sunglasses or scarves. The error rate has come down ten-fold since 2014, although no algorithm is perfect.\" WeSee's Mr Fulton says his tech is simply a tool to help people assess existing video footage more intelligently. He adds that WeSee can detect emotion in faces as effectively as a human can - \"with around 60%-70% accuracy\". More Technology of Business \"At the moment we can detect suspicious behaviour, but not intent, to prevent something bad from happening. But I think this is where it is going and we are already doing tests in this area.\" This sounds a step closer to the \"pre-crime\" concept featured in the sci-fi film Minority Report, where potential criminals are arrested before their crimes have even been committed. A further concern for civil liberties organisations? \"The key question we always ask ourselves is: Who is building this technology and for what purposes?\" says Privacy International's Frederike Kaltheuner. \"Is it used to help us - or to judge, assess and control us?\"", "summary": "La technologie de la reconnaissance faciale devient de plus en plus sophistiquée, et certaines entreprises affirment qu'elle peut même lire nos émotions et détecter des comportements suspects."}

And Castro connected with a few leaders, particularly Amílcar Cabral from Guinea-Bissau,\" Olivia Ahmad, the curator of the exhibition at the House of Illustration, told the BBC. Cabral led the fight against Portuguese colonial rule in Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde islands, but was assassinated in 1973, a year before Guinea-Bissau became independent. Ms Ahmad says more Tricontinental Conferences were planned, but never happened so Ospaaal's publishing arm became an important way to keep in contact and share information - and posters were folded up and put inside its publications. Latin America's most recognisable revolutionary, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, was \"probably the most depicted across the whole output of Ospaaal\", she says. \"But there are recurring ones of these African leaders being celebrated in the same way and commemorated as well.\" Guevara infamously went to what is now Democratic Republic of Congo in 1965 on a failed mission to foment revolt against the pro-Western regime four years after the assassination of Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba. Lumumba's killing, four months after he had being elected the country's first democratic prime minister, was widely blamed on US and UK intelligence agencies. \"The portraits are particularly interesting because they have all these pop art influences that you might not expect to see, so they are kind of celebrating people but in a genuinely celebratory way - rather than having a sort of like lumpen socialist-realist aesthetic,\" says Ms Ahmad. The works showcased in Designed in Cuba: Cold War Graphics exhibition were produced by 33 designers, many of them women - who made some of those most enduring images. A poster about Guinea-Bissau showing a woman holding a machine gun is by Berta Abelenda Fernandez, \"one of the women who made some of the most iconic designs for Ospaaal\", says Ms Ahmad. It is one of the recurring motifs - women with guns - showing them taking an active role and the Tricontinental magazine had \"quite a lot of contributions from women and articles about women as well on guerrilla fronts\", Ms Ahmad says. Castro played a major role in Angola, unlike Cuba's secret operations in Africa in the 1960s, where he saw an opportunity to exert his brand of international solidarity to make a difference on a global scale. Ahead of Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, Castro sent elite special forces and 35,000 soldiers to support the Marxist MPLA movement to stop apartheid South African troops installing pro-US movements to power. According to Alex Vines of the think tank Chatham House, at least 4,300 Cubans are thought to have died in conflicts in Africa, half of them in Angola alone where the civil war did not end until 2002. The posters carrying messages of solidarity to liberation fighters usually did so \"using bold visual metaphors or quite simple visual propositions\", says Ms Ahmad. They tended to have captions at the bottom, usually in four languages - English, Spanish, French and Arabic - \"to help them be more universal because they were intended for circulation rather than to be seen in Cuba\", she says. Ospaaal oversaw a huge publishing operation, which involved a lot of paper and ink. Olivio Martínez Viera, a designer who was at Ospaaal from almost the beginning, said there were often material shortages that meant they had to be quite creative. Viera \"talks really fondly about that time, about Ospaaal being a real nurturing space for experimentation and having the freedom to create these really direct visual metaphors like the Mozambique\" design of a dagger plunging through a hand, says Ms Ahmad. Much of Ospaaal's output was directed towards the fight against white-minority rule in South Africa, which did not end until 1994 when anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela was elected president. Teishan Latner's book Cuba Revolution in America shows a satirical advert for South African Airways included in Tricontinental's July-August 1968 issue promising \"an unforgettable vacation in the land of APARTHEID, where Africans are massacred, where prisons overflow with patriots fighting against white racists, where thousands of Blacks work as slaves in the gold mines, where miles and miles of land are used for concentration camps\". The images on the Ospaaal posters were just as blunt: After Mandela was imprisoned by the apartheid authorities in 1964, it was illegal to photograph or republish a photo of him in South Africa. This poster came out in 1989, a year before his release after 27 years in jail. The artists producing the posters were mainly based in Havana and were trying to understand the political context for real people often using press photographs, says Ms Ahmad. \"They are very graphically interesting… trying to sympathise with all these geopolitical messages. I think most are hits and then some of them are slightly questionable.\" It is not always clear what some of the stylised sculptures were based on. \"I think they're basically just trying to relate contemporary struggle in a long history,\" says Ms Ahmad. Ospaaal closed this year saying its work was done. \"I think the context for those international movements has really changed, so you can see why,\" says Ms Ahmad. But the curator says Ospaaal's work and diversity of output has been impressive and its ability to sum up complex messages in an engaging way. \"Also it's interesting to see what is essentially propaganda executed with humour and often levity,\" she says.

The labels would help people indulge less, exploratory studies suggest. The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits to fight obesity. According to the researchers from Loughborough University, who looked at 14 studies, this type of labelling could cut about 200 calories from a person's daily average intake. About calories This may not sound like much but, they say in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, it would have an impact on obesity levels across the country. More than two-thirds of adults in the UK are overweight or obese. Lead researcher Prof Amanda Daley said: \"We are interested in different ways of getting the public to make good decisions about what they eat and also trying to get the public more physically active.\" And labelling food with \"exercise calories\" made it easier for people to understand what they were eating and nudge them into making better choices. Prof Daley said many people would be shocked to realise how much physical exercise would be required to burn off calories from certain snacks and treats. \"We know that the public routinely underestimate the number of calories that are in foods,\" she said. \"So if you buy a chocolate muffin and it contains 500 calories, for example, then that's about 50 minutes of running. \"This definitely isn't about dieting. \"It's about educating the public that when you consume foods, there is an energy cost, so that they can think, 'Do I really want to spend two hours burning off that chocolate cake? Is the chocolate cake really worth it?'\" 'Triggering' risk The Royal Society for Public Health would like to see the labelling introduced as soon as possible and says it is a move many consumers would also welcome. It says: \"This type of labelling really does put an individual's calorie consumption in the context of energy expenditure and knowing how out of kilter we can be partly explains the record levels of obesity we face. \"Small changes can make a big overall difference to calorie consumption, and ultimately weight gain.\" Prof Daley hopes a large food chain or company will be willing to try the new labels on their products so the system can be given a \"real life\" trial. But concerns have been raised about labelling food in this way. Tom Quinn, from the eating disorder charity Beat, said: \"Although we recognise the importance of reducing obesity, labelling food in this way risks being incredibly triggering for those suffering from or vulnerable to eating disorders. \"We know that many people with eating disorders struggle with excessive exercising, so being told exactly how much exercise it would take to burn off particular foods risks exacerbating their symptoms.\"", "summary": "Les emballages alimentaires devraient indiquer la quantité d'exercice qu'une personne devrait faire pour brûler les calories contenues dans le produit acheté, selon des chercheurs britanniques."}

The writer and performer, who became the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, followed in the footsteps of such famous names as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. \"I really wanted to use my words to be a point of unity and collaboration and togetherness,\" Gorman told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme before the ceremony. \"I think it's about a new chapter in the United States, about the future, and doing that through the elegance and beauty of words.\" Gorman's reading was widely praised. US broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey tweeted that she had \"never been prouder to see another young woman rise\". Also on Twitter, Joanne Liu, the former head of aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières, described the poem as \"the most inspiring 5:43 minutes for the longest time\". Former First Lady Michelle Obama praised Gorman's \"strong and poignant words\" adding: \"Keep shining, Amanda!\" US politician and rights activist Stacey Abrams said the poem was \"an inspiration to us all\". Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted that Gorman had promised to run for president in 2036 and added: \"I for one can't wait.\" Illinois poet laureate Angela Jackson said the recitation was \"so rich and just so filled with truth\". \"I was stunned that she was so young and so wise,\" Jackson told the Chicago Sun-Times. Gorman said she \"screamed and danced her head off\" when she found out she had been chosen to read at President Biden's swearing-in ceremony. She said she felt \"excitement, joy, honour and humility\" when she was asked to take part, \"and also at the same time terror\". And she added that she hoped her poem, completed on the day supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, would \"speak to the moment\" and \"do this time justice\". Born in Los Angeles in 1998, Gorman had a speech impediment as a child - an affliction she shares with America's new president. \"It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be,\" she said in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times. \"When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds [and] be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience.\" Gorman became LA's youth poet laureate at 16. Three years later, while studying sociology at Harvard, she became National Youth Poet Laureate.

The findings, in Molecular Psychiatry, come from a review of 41 studies published within the last eight years. A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood. Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy? Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Mood food Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky. There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have. 'More trials needed' Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended \"a heavy dose of caution\". \"Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,\" he said. \"The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct.\" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on \"mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol\". \"It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. \"If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol. \"If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies.\" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.

And it very nearly didn't as the subzero conditions played havoc with the electronics and clouds moved in. But after several delays and as the Sunday afternoon light waned, Stardust finally lifted off, becoming the first commercial launch of a rocket powered by bio-derived fuel. Sascha Deri, who invented the biofuel, is cagey about what it's made of, but says it can be sourced from farms around the world. The founder and chief executive of bluShift Aerospace, he and his team have spent more than six years refining the formula and designing a modular hybrid engine, which is also unique. \"We want to prove that a bio-derived fuel can serve just as well, if not better in some cases, than traditional fuels to power rockets and payloads to space,\" he says. \"It actually costs less per kilogram than traditional rocket fuel and it's completely non-toxic. And it's a carbon-neutral fuel which is inherently better for our planet and more responsible.\" Stardust is a small rocket, just 20ft (6m) long and weighing 550lbs (250kg). But because it's relatively cheap to fly and doesn't need the high-tech infrastructure of larger rockets, it will help make space research accessible to more people. Students, researchers and businesses will be able to conduct experiments and test products with greater control and frequency. \"Right now there are freight trains to space like SpaceX and ULA - and there are buses to space, like medium size rockets,\" says Deri. \"They're taking thousands of kilograms to space. But there's no space launch service allowing one or two payloads to go to space. There's no Uber to space. We want to be the Uber service to space.\" For the first launch, the payload included a high school experiment and tests on an alloy called nitinol made by Kellogg Research Labs in Salem, New Hampshire. Founder Joe Kellogg says nitinol is a shape memory material that is used in medical devices such as stents. It is also used to protect rocket payloads from vibrations. \"We're very heavily involved in space and trying to get into the larger missions like the lunar missions and the Mars missions that are coming up. Our long-term goal is to build whole rockets out of nitinol,\" he says. \"We think we can make them lighter and more energy efficient.\" While Stardust flew just one mile into the sky before parachuting back to Earth, a second planned rocket will be suborbital and a later version called Red Dwarf will enter polar orbit. Polar orbits offer more exposure to land than equatorial orbits. And Maine is geographically suited to such launches which makes it attractive to the growing space satellite communication industry, says Terry Shehata, executive director of Maine Space Grant Consortium which is funded by the US space agency Nasa. By some estimates, small satellite launch services could generate $69bn (£50bn) within the next decade. bluShift alone expects to create 40 new jobs in five years through launching tiny satellites known as cubesats. Maine already has the infrastructure to support the industry, says Shehata. At the height of the Cold War, Loring Air Force Base at Limestone was the nation's front line of defence. B-52 bombers armed with nuclear warheads constantly circled the skies on high alert to deter any threat from Russia. Stardust launched from the base's three-mile runway of reinforced concrete and was temporarily housed in a hangar built for fighter jets. The base closed in 1994, with devastating economic effects on the region. Other former bases include Brunswick Landing which could become Mission Control for a statewide spaceport complex. \"Maine has the right resources, we have the people, we have the geographical advantage of being able to launch into polar orbit. All we need to do is believe in ourselves that we can do this,\" says Deri.

According to the Official Charts Company in the UK, the sale of cassettes in the first half of 2020 increased by 103% compared to the same time period the previous year.

Ms Le Pen, leader of the National Front (FN), is accused of incitement to hatred and discrimination. The vote followed a move by a committee of MEPs to remove her immunity. The request to do so came from the chief prosecutor's office in Lyon, the city where, in December 2010, Ms Le Pen told FN supporters that the sight of Muslims praying in the street was similar to the Nazi occupation in World War II. In her speech, broadcast by French media, she said that first France had seen \"more and more veils\", then \"more and more burkas\" and \"after that came prayers in the streets... I'm sorry, but some people are very fond of talking about the Second World War and about the occupation, so let's talk about occupation, because that is what is happening here... There are no tanks, no soldiers, but it is still an occupation, and it weighs on people\". Ms Le Pen took 17.9% of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election last year. 'Dissident' Praying in the streets was banned in Paris in 2011 in response to growing far-right protests. And in the same year France became the first EU state to ban public wearing of the face-covering Islamic veil (niqab). By some estimates as many as six million French people, or just under 10% of the population, are Muslims, most of them from France's former North African colonies. Speaking to the French broadcaster LCI on Tuesday Ms Le Pen defended her remarks, saying she would lose her parliamentary immunity \"because I'm a dissident\", adding: \"I'm not at all afraid of it, I'm scornful of it\". She described the move against her as \"intimidation\" and said she had \"dared to say what all the French people think\". Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was formerly the FN leader and has several convictions for racism. The European Parliament stripped him of his immunity in 1997 and he was later fined by a German court for minimising the Holocaust. He had dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as \"a detail\" in World War II history. Under European Parliament rules, immunity covers MEPs for any opinions they express within the parliament. But the rules say that \"immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found in the act of committing an offence and shall not prevent the European Parliament from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its members\". The Labour MEP Mary Honeyball, who sits on the parliament's legal affairs committee, told the BBC: \"Quite rightly, Marine Le Pen will now face prosecution following today's vote. It's taken a long time, but she must now defend her actions in a French court and follow the proper legal procedure which almost nobody else in France has immunity from. She is not above reproach.\" And another committee member, Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim, said Ms Le Pen \"is, and always will be, a polarising politician who seeks only to divide rather than unite\". \"It is disappointing that she tries to hide behind her EU immunity as she espouses anti-EU and anti-immigration sentiments. Using Nazi occupation in France as a comparison to Muslims praying on the street is appalling, insulting and highly inflammatory,\" he said.", "summary": "La justice française a demandé fin mars au Parlement européen la levée de l'immunité de Marine Le Pen, la candidate du Front national à la présidentielle et député européenne."}

Mr Gon Coulibaly had only just returned from France where he had received two-months' heart treatment. President Ouattara said the country was in mourning. He said Mr Gon Coulibaly had become unwell during a weekly cabinet meeting and was taken to hospital where he later died. \"I pay tribute to my younger brother, my son, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who was for 30 years my closest partner,\" the president said. \"I salute the memory of a statesman of great loyalty, devotion and love for the homeland.\" Mr Gon Coulibaly's death creates huge uncertainty over the election. He had received a heart transplant in 2012 and had travelled to Paris on 2 May for the insertion of a stent. He returned last Thursday saying: \"I am back to take my place by the side of the president, to continue the task of developing and building our country.\" Mr Gon Coulibaly was among the favourites to win the presidential election. An article in Le Monde on Monday quoted one foreign observer as saying: \"If Gon Coulibaly were unfit, Ouattara would have no choice but to run as a candidate because there is no plan B. \"This matter has so far remained taboo because the president has clearly shown his willingness to leave and indicated who his choice was to succeed him.\" Mr Ouattara's decision in March not to run stunned the country. At the time, the BBC's James Copnall wrote from the main city, Abidjan, that there was praise from politicians as Mr Ouattara broke the normal mould for the region of trying to remain in power.

In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter. The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy. China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook. The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis. While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. Analysis: Wider implications? By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent China's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth. But still, we should be worried. Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world. It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us. Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy. Slowdown warnings Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market. Earlier this month Apple warned weakness in China would hit its sales. Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US. China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption. Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy. Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 \"but held up better than many feared\". \"Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year.\"", "summary": "La croissance de l'économie chinoise a été la plus lente depuis 1990.

In 1619, a ship arrived in an English settlement in what is now the US state of Virginia, carrying some 20 captured Africans. It's the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans in an area that would go on to become part of the United States. They had been seized by English pirates off the coast of Mexico, from a Portuguese slave ship. The Portuguese vessel had been carrying about 350 Africans, taken from what is now Angola. Many had died during the voyage because of the terrible conditions they endured. The English pirates went on to sell the Africans they had seized to colonists in Virginia, who needed labour. It's a matter of historical debate what exactly happened to them once they were sold. But formal systems of slavery and racial separation did become established in later years as the number of Africans brought over to America began to grow. Were they the first slaves taken to the Americas? Some experts say the significance of 1619 should not be over-emphasised because, by then, Africans were already being used on tobacco plantations in the English-run colony of Bermuda. It's also believed there were Africans on expeditions to both North and South America by English and Spanish maritime adventurers in the 16th Century. And Portuguese traders had been taking slaves to their colonies since the 15th Century. How is this anniversary being marked? The US Congress has established a special commission to mark 400 years of African-American history this year. Ms Pelosi's delegation to Ghana includes senior black members of the Congress. After visiting some of the sites from which enslaved people were shipped across the Atlantic, Ms Pelosi said it was \"a sobering testament to humanity's capacity for great evil.\" Ghana has declared 2019 The Year of Return, with programmes aimed at encouraging people of African descent to visit and even settle.

Teeth-whitening can only be performed legally in the UK by professionals registered with the GDC. One beauty school claimed to have provided \"thousands\" of candidates with illegitimate qualifications, an undercover investigation found. Failure to comply with the requirement to be registered can result in a criminal record and an unlimited fine. Untrained beauticians using teeth-whitening kits have been known to cause tooth loss, burns and blisters. Dr Ben Atkins, president of the Oral Health Foundation, said: \"When things go wrong in dentistry, they can really go wrong. \"I've been that dentist with the full back up service when the patient's had that heart attack. \"It would be catastrophic for the patient and the person who's been trained and told it's legal to do it.\" Last year 732 cases of illegal-teeth whitening were reported to the GDC, a 26% increase from 582 in 2018 - though the figure was higher in 2016. The dentists' regulatory body relies on reports from customers, so the real number could be much higher. The GDC said it had launched 126 prosecutions against illegal teeth whiteners since 2015. It lacks the powers to prosecute those performing training, such as those filmed by BBC London. The BBC uncovered several companies offering just a few hours of training for fraudulent qualifications. Two undercover BBC researchers attended a course with the London School of Nails and Beauty that lasted five hours. Attendees were told they could earn \"from £80 upwards per session\" after receiving a certificate, which they were told would allow them to set up their own business to treat customers. School principal Cha McDonald said the process was \"legal\" as customers would be asked to carry out parts of the procedure themselves. She claimed \"thousands\" of people had undergone training at the school. A spokesperson for the General Dental Council said: \"Handing an individual a tooth whitening tray and advising them on application, amongst other things, could constitute the giving of 'advice or attendance' and in those circumstances would be a criminal offence.\" Emergencies were not covered at all during the training attended by the BBC and when asked what to do in an emergency, Ms McDonald advised the BBC researchers posing as students to \"call an ambulance like everybody else\". The BBC asked the London School of Nails and Beauty why it was providing training that could open candidates to prosecution but there was no response. The British Dental Association (BDA) said \"sham\" schools preyed \"on vulnerabilities of beauticians and others\". People attending these schools were putting themselves at risk of ending up in jail or being fined, according to Dr Len D'Cruz from the BDA. One beautician who had undergone similar training said: \"I may as well have burnt the money I spent. \"I was struggling as a beautician as it was and I nearly went bankrupt. \"I think as a direct result I lost all my confidence. I went through anxiety and suffered depression.

So the polling was done before the US president gave the order to kill Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani. Here are some key findings. Views on Trump... Only 29% of the countries surveyed by Pew expressed confidence in Mr Trump last year, in keeping with how his presidency has been viewed since its infancy in 2017. Pew notes that this lack of confidence is in part due to opposition to the president's foreign policy. Mr Trump's policies on tariffs, climate, immigration and Iran are all largely unpopular globally. His negotiations with North Korea's Kim Jong-un garnered the most support, with a median 41% approval across the 33 countries polled. ... and views on America Unlike Mr Trump, the US remains favourable in the eyes of the world, generally speaking, Pew found. \"Favourable opinion of the US declined dramatically when Trump took office and remains significantly lower than during the Obama era,\" Pew reported. But in the last year, there have been some increases in favourable views of the US, which Pew says \"may be driven at least in part by increased favourability among supporters of right-wing populist groups in some nations\". Overall, Israel has the highest rating of the US in Pew's survey, with 83% of those polled viewing the US in a favourable light. In Mexico, the Middle East and Northern Africa, views of the US are mostly negative. In Turkey, just one in five reported a favourable opinion of the US. How Trump stacks up against other leaders It appears none of the five leaders have received particularly high marks overall, but Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel saw the highest of the group. The US president received the highest negative ratings of the group, though Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping were also seen in a negative light. \"Trump is more popular among people on the political right, yet even among these respondents, confidence in Trump rises to 50% or higher in only six nations,\" according to the report. So which countries love Trump the most? While overall, it seems the world lacks confidence that the US president will make the right choices, Mr Trump does find support in some countries. Mr Trump is popular in the African nations surveyed despite his past missteps - including reportedly calling African states \"shithole countries\". Kenya and Nigeria, which view Mr Trump favourably, are both among the top recipients of US economic aid, according to the Security Assistance Monitor. Pew also notes sub-Saharan African nations have typically expressed favourable opinions of the US. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was the first sub-Saharan African leader invited to the White House in 2018. The Trump administration also sold 12 US military aircraft to Nigeria in a reversal of an Obama-era policy. Mr Trump's support in the Philippines is less surprising, considering his praise for his Philippine counterpart Rodrigo Duterte. In 2017, Mr Trump was criticised for telling Mr Duterte he was doing an \"unbelievable job on the drug problem\" in his country. Since coming into office in 2016, Mr Duterte has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drug trade, which critics allege undermines human rights. Mr Trump's favourability in Israel is also expected; the US president has a close relationship with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and the US has long been supportive of Israel. The Trump administration has gone controversially further in that support - moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognising Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which was seized from Syria in 1967. How the world has viewed US presidents For most countries, there is a clear lack of trust in Mr Trump's international policy in comparison to his predecessor, but the trends, as tracked by Pew since 2002, do appear to have a partisan pattern. President George W Bush, the Republican who preceded Democrat Barack Obama, saw similarly low trust ratings throughout his tenure.", "summary": "Le président Donald Trump est un personnage polarisant chez lui - mais comment s'en sort-il à l'étranger ?

What does royal protocol say? The rules about who gets to be a prince and also be referred to as his royal highness (HRH) come from a letter patent issued by King George V in November 1917. Letters patent are legal instruments which may take the form of an open letter from the monarch. They may be used for royal declarations or the granting of titles such as peerages. In the 1917 letter, George V declared that the great-grandchildren of the monarch would no longer be princes or princesses, except for the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. In our current situation, that means that Prince George, the eldest son of Prince William, automatically became a prince, but not Archie, even though they are both great-grandsons of the Queen. Under this protocol, Prince George's siblings - Charlotte and Louis - would not have received the title either. But in December 2012, the Queen also issued a letter patent which said that all of Prince William's children would be entitled to be princes or princesses and get the HRH title. Also, being a prince or princess only goes through the male line, which means that the children of Princess Anne did not get those titles despite being the Queen's grandchildren. What about Archie's title? According to the 1917 letter, Archie is entitled to become a prince - but not yet. The children of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, would have to wait until Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, became king, at which point they would be the grandchildren of the monarch and hence entitled to be princes or princesses. That is why Prince Andrew's daughters - Beatrice and Eugenie - were princesses from birth, for example. The Duchess of Sussex was clearly aware of the protocol. She referred in the interview to a \"George V or George VI convention\" that would mean her son Archie would become a prince \"when Harry's dad becomes king\". But she went on to say that she had been told when she was pregnant that \"they want to change the convention for Archie\" so he would not become a prince. She did not give any more details about this and Buckingham Palace has not commented on her claims. \"I saw that Meghan mentioned that there were plans to narrow eligibility and I imagine that this is a reference to the Prince of Wales's stated view that the size of the royal family needs to be reduced,\" said Bob Morris from the Constitution Unit at UCL. \"However, he has not so far as I know given details of how it should be accomplished.\"", "summary": "Dans son interview avec Oprah Winfrey, Meghan, la duchesse de Sussex, raconte que lorsqu'elle était enceinte, il y avait des conversations sur le statut de son futur enfant, notamment sur le titre qu'il devrait recevoir."}

The tourist resort is brimming with Italian restaurants, pizzerias, delis and gelato shops - billboards advertise in Italian, restaurant menus offer after-dinner liquors such as Limoncello and Amaro. Most people speak Italian - from the Kenyan housekeeper where I stayed and the tuk-tuk drivers who ferried me around, to the waiters and the fisherman hanging around on the beach. It is the town's lingua franca. As you walk around the charming old Swahili streets, you hear its lyrical sound all around you, along with the sight of dozens of tanned Italians. The supermarket in the heart of Malindi is run by an Italian and is full of imports, from wine, pasta, jars of olives and capers - and it has a cold counter with a fine selection of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, salami and Italian ham. And, most exciting for me, the Grisbì buttery biscuits filled with heavenly lemon cream. Racial politics When I headed to the beachfront, I was confronted by an elderly Italian crowd at the Osteria beach restaurant. Two women clad in bright bikinis and chic sunglasses walked over, shouting \"Ciao, Ali, Ciao, Ali\" as one the waiters ran to fuss over them. \"Buongiorno signora,\" he said, as he made up their beach beds. Next to them an Italian couple tanned themselves with their skin turning to a Dorito-chocolate shade. I often had to do a double-take to make sure I was in Malindi and not Palermo or Naples. It felt like it could be any beach I've visited in Italy - the only difference being the humidity, palm trees and the salty sweet scent of the Indian Ocean. When I tried to nab an empty beach bed by a large palm tree, a waiter came running over to tell me the spot was always reserved for an Italian couple. It has to be said that it felt very peculiar to be there as a black traveller, even one learning Italian. In one of the town's cafés I had to raise my hand several times to be noticed - and even from Italians, usually so friendly at home, there was little warmth. There are many subtle ways black tourists are rendered invisible - something that is not unique to Malindi in Africa. And racial politics has reared its head in Malindi, with some coastal communities feeling that Italians get a free pass given how much they own in the town. There has even been anger at times at the impunity Italians are perceived to enjoy, with many locals believing they are not even investigated if there's crime. Space and tourism The history of the Italians in Malindi goes back to the opening of the Italian-run Broglio Space Centre off Kenya's coast. The first Italians to arrive in the town were engineers and scientists, who loved what they found. Word soon spread about Malindi's miles of pristine beaches, abundance of seafood and good-natured inhabitants. By the 1970s the community began to take shape, with many settling in Malindi and pursuing opportunities in the tourism industry. They opened hotels, restaurants, built beach villas and became economically integral in the town. Broglio Space Centre: The town had its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s when tourism boomed and estimates suggest 4,000 Italians lived in the town and 30,000 visited annually. But a shadier side to Malindi also emerged with allegations that the underage sex trade was rampant, as was the drugs trade and even whispers of the Italian mafia's presence. Still the tropical paradise with its hint of noir flourished until a slump began with Italy's financial crash of 2008. Then terror attacks by Somali militants started in Kenya - and the kidnapping of a foreign tourist a little further up the coast in 2011 by Somali pirates changed things. Many Italians sold up and left, far fewer came to visit. And it is something that Kenyans there regret, despite their occasional grumbles about Italians. Today Malindi feels like a town that has seen better days and locals struggle to eke out a living, made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic. But it is still a blissful place to relax and enjoy if you can visit, and while tucking into a delicious plate of crab linguine, I felt transported back in time if not place.

Ms Markle, 36, a Protestant, will be baptised into the Church of England and confirmed before the wedding. A spokesman for the prince said the pair would make sure the wedding \"reflects who they are as a couple\". Jason Knauf said Prince Harry, 33, and Ms Markle were \"leading the planning process for all aspects of the wedding\" and were working through ideas on how members of the public could \"feel part of the celebrations\". \"This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters of the bride and groom,\" he added. Mr Knauf described Windsor as a \"very special place\" for the couple, saying they had spent time there together since meeting in July 2016. He also revealed that the American actress intends to become a British citizen and will work towards it in the coming years. St George's Chapel was the venue for a service of prayer and dedication after Harry's father, the Prince of Wales, married the Duchess of Cornwall at the Windsor Guildhall in 2005. It was also chosen for the wedding of Harry's cousin, Peter Phillips, and Autumn Kelly in 2008, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex in 1999. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said St George's Chapel held many happy childhood memories for Prince Harry, and while a more intimate venue than Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral, was grand enough for royal wedding. Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, and Ms Markle announced their engagement on Monday. Mr Knauf said it was \"an incredibly happy day\" for the couple and they were \"overwhelmed by support from the UK and around the world\". Bogart left behind Their 16-month relationship began when they met on a blind date in London arranged by a mutual friend. The couple gave their first joint TV interview to the BBC's Mishal Husain on Monday - revealing the proposal came as they made roast chicken at home earlier this month. They also discussed Ms Markle's pet dogs and Mr Knauf revealed that while one of them, Guy, was legally allowed to stay with her in the UK, the other, Bogart, would not be joining her. The prince and Ms Markle will carry out their first official engagement together in Nottingham on Friday. They will go on a walkabout and visit the Nottingham Contemporary which is hosting a Terrence Higgins Trust World Aids Day charity fair, and Nottingham Academy to meet head teachers. Their spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations, and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. She is to become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Speaking during a visit to the Foundling Museum in London on Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge said both she and Prince William hoped the couple \"enjoy this happy moment\". An intimate and private venue By Adam Whitty, BBC News, Windsor St George's Chapel is shrouded in darkness tonight, the 15th Century gothic building shielded by the walls of Windsor Castle. However, on a cold and dark night, there is a real atmosphere of warmth and light in Windsor with the knowledge this town will be the centre of the world in six months' time. A shop worker (whose tills will surely be ringing relentlessly in the build up to the big day) said the day would be like a \"fairytale\" for Windsor and the country as a whole. A woman called Elaine, who used to volunteer in the chapel for a number of years, said St George's offered a much more intimate experience for an occasion like this. \"We just think of ourselves as really lucky,\" she said. \"It's going to be an incredible atmosphere on the day.\" The couple announced plans for a spring wedding on Monday, but by choosing May, have avoided a potential clash with the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's third child and the Queen's appearance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London and Windsor - both of which are in April. Downing Street has said there are no plans for a bank holiday to mark the wedding, after the possibility was mooted on social media.

The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. \"Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola.\" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. The oil connection One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President João Lourenço has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family. 29 millionpopulation 27-yearcivil war, fought from independence to 2002 $4,170average income, but this masks big disparities 30%of population live in poverty - less than $1.90/day 2ndbiggest oil producer in Africa. Also major diamond producer The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills. One asks for €472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for €676,339.97 - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired. \"Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred.\" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: \"All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors.\" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006. The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining €63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than €750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost €9m of interest owing. But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. \"There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings.\" Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. The diamond connection It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a €5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: \"In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m.\" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Who is Isabel dos Santos? Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more: Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost. Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The land connection The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: \"I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering.\" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled. The telecoms connection The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend €350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner. The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: \"This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel.\" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies. But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the \"very serious and concerning allegations\". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. \"PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. \"So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'\" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. \"In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry. \"We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.\" Panorama: The Corrupt Billionaire is available on BBC iPlayer in UK.", "summary": "Des documents ayant fait l'objet d'une fuite révèlent comment la femme la plus riche d'Afrique a fait sa fortune en exploitant son propre pays."}

Most of the time it is either a meaningless tweak or the virus alters itself in such a way that it gets worse at infecting us and the new variant just dies out. Occasionally it hits on a new winning formula. There is no clear-cut evidence the new variant of coronavirus - which has been detected in south-east England - is able to transmit more easily, cause more serious symptoms or render the vaccine useless. However, there are two reasons scientists are keeping a close eye on it. The first is that levels of the variant are higher in places where cases are higher. It is a warning sign, although it can be interpreted in two ways. The virus could have mutated to spread more easily and is causing more infections. But variants can also get a lucky break by infecting the right people at the right time. One explanation for the spread of the \"Spanish strain\" over the summer was simply people catching it on holiday and then bringing it home. It will take experiments in the laboratory to figure out if this variant really is a better spreader than all the others. The other issue that is raising scientific eyebrows is how the virus has mutated. \"It has a surprisingly large number of mutations, more than we would expect, and a few look interesting,\" Prof Nick Loman from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium told me. There are two notable sets of mutation - and I apologise for their hideous names. Both are found in the crucial spike protein, which is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells in order to hijack them. The mutation N501 (I did warn you) alters the most important part of the spike, known as the \"receptor-binding domain\". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. \"It looks and smells like an important adaptation,\" said Prof Loman. The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. The concern was that antibodies from the blood of survivors was less effective at attacking that variant of virus. Again, it is going to take more laboratory studies to really understand what is going on. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"We know there's a variant, we know nothing about what that means biologically. \"It is far too early to make any inference on how important this may or may not be.\" Mutations to the spike protein lead to questions about the vaccine because the three leading jabs - Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford - all train the immune system to attack the spike. However, the body learns to attack multiple parts of the spike. That is why health officials remain convinced the vaccine will work against this variant. This is a virus that evolved in animals and made the jump to infecting people around a year ago. Since then it has been picking up around two mutations a month - take a sample today and compare it to the first ones from Wuhan in China and there would be around 25 mutations separating them. Coronavirus is still trying out different combinations of mutations to properly nail infecting humans. We have seen this happen before: The emergence and global dominance of another variant (G614) is seen by many as the virus getting better at spreading. But soon mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunized. If this does drive the evolution of the virus, we may have to regularly update the vaccines, as we do for flu, to keep up.

The engineers involved say the impact is achieved by adding different-sized particles of calcium carbonate. Buildings of all types are one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions. According to the World Green Building Council, the lighting, heating and cooling of buildings is responsible for around 28% of global CO2. That's because the heating and cooling of buildings is mainly powered by coal, oil and gas - In Europe, around 75% of this energy need comes from fossil fuels. For decades, researchers have been trying to come up with ideas to increase the efficiency of cooling and heating. A number of reflective paints have been developed for the outside of homes and offices that would reflect away sunlight and reduce the temperatures inside. As yet, none of these products have been able to deflect enough of the Sun's rays to make the building's temperature lower than the ambient conditions. Now, researchers in the US say they have developed a white paint with strong cooling properties. \"In one experiment where we put a painted surface outside under direct sunlight, the surface cooled 1.7C below the ambient temperature and during night time it even cooled up to 10C below the ambient temperature,\" said Prof Xiulin Ruan, from Purdue University in Indiana, who's an author on the study. \"This is a significant amount of cooling power that can offset the majority of the air conditioning needs for typical buildings.\" So how does the new paint work? According to the researchers, the key has been to add calcium carbonate to the mix. The scientists found that by using high concentrations of this chalky substance, with differing particle sizes, they were able to develop a product that reflected 95.5% of sunlight. \"Sunlight is a broad spectrum of wavelengths,\" said Prof Xiulin Ruan. \"We know that each particle size can only scatter one wavelength effectively so we decided to use different particle sizes to scatter all the wavelengths. This is an important contributor eventually resulting in this very high reflectance.\" The researchers say the paint may have a broad range of applications - particularly in data centres, which require large amounts of cooling. Since the paint lacks metallic components, it is unlikely to interfere with electromagnetic signals, making it suitable for cooling telecommunications equipment. There are a number of steps to go through before this product will be available commercially, as it needs to be tested for its long-term reliability and efficiency. But the researchers are optimistic; patents have been filed and there is strong interest from major manufacturers.

But a US study over 25 years indicates that moderate carb consumption - or switching meat for plant-based protein and fats - is healthier. The study relied on people remembering the amount of carbohydrates they ate. 'Gaining widespread popularity' In the study, published in The Lancet Public Health, 15,400 people from the US filled out questionnaires on the food and drink they consumed, along with portion sizes. From this, scientists estimated the proportion of calories they got from carbohydrates, fats, and protein. After following the group for an average of 25 years, researchers found that those who got 50-55% of their energy from carbohydrates (the moderate carb group and in line with UK dietary guidelines) had a slightly lower risk of death compared with the low and high-carb groups. Carbohydrates include vegetables, fruit and sugar but the main source of them is starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals. The NHS Eatwell Guide provides details on how to achieve this kind of healthy, balanced diet and reduce the risk of serious illnesses in the long term. Researchers estimated that, from the age of 50, people in the moderate carb group were on average expected to live for another 33 years. This was: The findings were similar to previous studies the authors compared their work with, which included more than 400,000 people from more than 20 countries. The scientists then compared low-carb diets rich in animal proteins and fats with those that contained lots of plant-based protein and fat. They found that eating more beef, lamb, pork, chicken and cheese in place of carbs was linked with a slightly increased risk of death. But replacing carbohydrates with more plant-based proteins and fats, such as legumes and nuts, was actually found to slightly reduce the risk of mortality. Dr Sara Seidelmann, clinical and research fellow in cardiovascular medicine from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who led the research, said: \"Low-carb diets that replace carbohydrates with protein or fat are gaining widespread popularity as a health and weight-loss strategy. \"However, our data suggests that animal-based low carbohydrate diets, which are prevalent in North America and Europe, might be associated with shorter overall life span and should be discouraged. \"Instead, if one chooses to follow a low carbohydrate diet, then exchanging carbohydrates for more plant-based fats and proteins might actually promote healthy ageing in the long term.\" 'Not enough to focus on nutrients' The authors speculate that Western-type diets that restrict carbohydrates often result in lower intake of vegetables, fruit, and grains and lead to greater consumption of animal proteins and fats, which have been linked to inflammation and ageing in the body. Prof Nita Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: \"A really important message from this study is that it is not enough to focus on the nutrients, but whether they are derived from animal or plant sources. \"When carbohydrate intake is reduced in the diet, there are benefits when this is replaced with plant-origin fat and protein food sources, but not when replaced with animal-origin sources such as meats.\" However, there are limitations to the study. The findings show observational associations rather than cause-and-effect and what people ate was based on self-reported data, which might not be accurate. And the authors acknowledge that since diets were measured only at the start of the trial and six years later, dietary patterns could have changed over the subsequent 19 years. 'High fibre intake' Prof Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, also pointed out that the use of a food questionnaire in the study led to people underestimating the calories and fat they had eaten. \"One explanation for the finding in this and the other US studies is that it may reflect the higher risk of death in the overweight/obese, who may fall into two popular diet camps - those favouring a high-meat/low-carbohydrate diet and those favouring a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet,\" he added. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \"This provides further evidence that low-carb diets could be incredibly damaging to our long-term health. \"High-fibre starchy carbohydrates should provide about half of our energy, including fruit and vegetables, while reducing intake of higher fat meat and dairy.\" Follow Alex on Twitter.", "summary": "Selon une étude, un régime pauvre en glucides pourrait réduire l'espérance de vie de quatre ans."}

The 46-year-old lives abroad, saying she moved from Angola because her life had been threatened. She runs a huge business empire with stakes in companies in Angola and Portugal, where she has shares in cable television firm Nos SGPS. The court ordered the freezing of Ms Dos Santos' Angolan bank accounts and the seizure of her stake in local companies, including telecoms giant Unitel and bank Fomento de Angola (BFA), the state-owned news agency reported. In a statement, she said she condemned what she described as a \"politically motivated attack\" against her. \"I discovered that a trial had been held in total secrecy in Angola and the decision taken to issue a freezing order on my assets. There were no lawyers from my side present, nor the directors of my companies. We were only informed about it after the decision had been taken behind our backs. \"I have spent the last 24 hours trying to give assurances to my staff and all the families affected by this order that we must not give in. I will use all the instruments of Angolan and international law at my disposal to fight this order and ensure the truth comes out.\" Ms Dos Santos gained a high public profile in 2016, when her father controversially appointed her as the head of Angola's state-owned oil firm Sonangol. She was sacked from the post in 2017 by Mr Lourenço, her father's handpicked successor. Her brother, José Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial in Angola on charges of corruption. The prosecution alleges that he and his co-accused helped spirit $500m out of the country during his time as head of Angola's Sovereign Wealth Fund. They have pleaded not guilty. Serious about reforms? By Andrew Harding, BBC Africa correspondent The court order was read out on state television - a powerful gesture in a country where, for decades, the Dos Santos family had seemed untouchable. Now, the fate of the vast business empire of Isabel dos Santos, the eldest daughter of the former president, is in doubt. Two years ago, Mr Dos Santos stepped down after 38 years in power. And to the surprise of many, his successor turned against the family, promising a major crackdown on corruption. Since then, billions of dollars in stolen assets have been recovered from abroad. Angolans are waiting to see if one alleged kleptocracy will simply be replaced by another or whether, as many hope, this vast oil-rich but impoverished nation is now serious about reforms and justice.", "summary": "Un tribunal angolais a ordonné la saisie des actifs et des comptes bancaires d'Isabel Dos Santos, la fille milliardaire de l'ex-président José Eduardo dos Santos."}

Another cruise ship where dozens of cases have been confirmed remains in quarantine off Japan. The outbreak has killed 910 people, all but two in mainland China. The coronavirus has now killed more people than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). In 2003, that epidemic killed 774 people in more than two dozen countries. In the Chinese province of Hubei alone, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, more than 800 people have died, according to regional health officials. More than 40,000 have been infected worldwide, the vast majority in China. Why was the ship quarantined? The World Dream was put in quarantine on Wednesday after it emerged that three passengers who had sailed on a previous voyage were later found to have contracted the virus. Chief port health officer Leng Yiu-Hong said all crew members - some 1,800 people - had tested negative for coronavirus, and that everyone would be allowed to disembark without the need to self-quarantine after leaving. On Sunday, Hong Kong's health minister said 468 people had been ordered to stay at home, in hotel rooms or government-run centres, one day after officials implemented a mandatory two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving from mainland China. In mainland China, millions of people were preparing to return to work after an extended Lunar New Year break, imposed in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. However, a high number of companies and businesses will remain closed and many people are expected to work from home. In Hebei province, which surrounds the capital Beijing, state media reported schools would remain shut until at least 1 March, while many parts of Hubei province remain on lockdown. Other areas are under severe travel and gathering restrictions. What else is happening? Several more cases were confirmed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been in quarantine in the Japanese city of Yokohama for nearly a week, the Kyodo news agency reports. Authorities said on Saturday 64 people had been infected on the ship, which is carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew. On Saturday, the chief of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was still concentrated in Hubei, and that it appeared that the number of cases had stabilised slightly over the previous four days. Dr Tedros, who previously praised the Chinese government for its measures at the epicentre of the outbreak, reiterated that the slowdown was \"an opportunity\" to contain the virus. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, China's ambassador to the UK said it was still \"very difficult to predict when we're going to have an inflection point\", but that the \"isolation and quarantine measures have been very effective\". Liu Xiaoming called the disease \"the enemy of mankind\", but said it was \"controllable, preventable, curable\" and told people not to panic. Meanwhile, concerns were growing about the whereabouts of Chinese lawyer and blogger Chen Qiushi, who had posted online videos including of conditions inside hospitals and people queuing up for masks in Wuhan, in Hubei province. Mr Chen, whose content was being widely shared, has been missing since Thursday. There are unconfirmed reports that he may have been forced into quarantine. In an interview with the BBC last week, he said he was not sure how long he would be allowed to continue to report on the outbreak, saying: \"The censorship is so strict, people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content\". His disappearance comes amid widespread anger and grief across China over the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn fellow medics about the virus in December but was told by police to \"stop making false comments\" and investigated for \"spreading rumours\". China has been criticised for its initial handling of the outbreak and accused of trying, in some cases, to keep news of it secret. But Ambassador Liu put the blame of Dr Li's case on local authorities, saying: \"[Dr Li] will be remembered as a hero... and for his brave contribution\". In other developments: Last month, the WHO declared a global health emergency over the new outbreak.

Two of the babies, one boy and one girl, are in a stable condition in a hospital in San Luis Potosí state. But the second boy is receiving treatment for a respiratory condition. A spokesperson for the state's Health Safety Committee said contagion in multiple births had not been detected anywhere globally and so the case would be investigated. A very small number of newborn babies have been known to pick up the virus after birth, but health officials say they do not believe this is what happened in this case. State Health Secretary Mónica Liliana Rangel Martínez said: \"It would be impossible for them to have been infected at the moment of birth.\" However, the parents are currently being tested, with authorities saying they may have been asymptomatic. Mexico has recorded more than 185,000 coronavirus cases and 22,584 deaths since the country's first case on 28 February. Coronavirus in newborns The triplets - born prematurely on 17 June in Mexico - all tested positive for coronavirus on the day of their birth. Coronavirus in newborns is unusual, but not unheard of. Babies can catch the virus after birth if they have close contact with anyone who is already infected. Coronavirus might also be passed on in the womb from mother to baby via the placenta. US researchers from Yale School of Medicine recently reported the first known case of placental infection with coronavirus. When infection does occur, the risk to mother and baby is often low - although some reports suggest it might increase the likelihood of babies being born early. There is no evidence that the virus causes miscarriage or affects how your baby develops in pregnancy, but, as a precaution, pregnant women are advised to be strict about avoiding close social contact to reduce their chance of getting coronavirus. If they do become infected, most mums-to-be will have mild or moderate symptoms and recover. Babies may show no signs of the illness at all. If you are caring for a baby, you can reduce their risk of getting the virus by keeping your hands clean with regular hand washing.", "summary": "Au Mexique, des triplés nouveau-nés ont été testés positifs au coronavirus, un cas \"sans précédent\", selon les autorités sanitaires locales."}

Everyone's choice is different - weighing up the risk of potential side effects against the chance of contracting coronavirus and perhaps becoming seriously ill, or even dying. We don't know enough to be able to plug the data into a calculator and get a simple, exact answer tailored to you. But here's the best information we currently have on the possible risks and benefits. The events are so rare, we need to start off with a huge number of people to make sense of them. So, let's take a figure of 10 million imaginary people. What are the risks of blood clots with the AZ vaccine? Regulators are continuously combing through the details of the rare clots that have occurred to work out how many might be caused by vaccination. Assuming the worst - that they all are - we can do some ballpark calculations to get a sense of the risks. Based on the figures announced on Wednesday by the UK medicines regulator, if 10 million imaginary people were given the AZ vaccine you might expect to see 40 of these clots - with about 10 clots having fatal consequences. Ten deaths out of 10 million people vaccinated is a one-in-a-million chance. That's roughly the same risk as being murdered in the next month or - if you get in a car and drive for 250 miles - the risk of you dying in a road accident on that journey. How does that compare to the normal risk of these clots? Roughly 40 men and 100 women in our imaginary group of 10 million might expect to have one of these clots in any given year without vaccination, with more seen in younger people. That's about 12 a month - so seeing a larger number in just a few weeks after vaccination is part of the picture of higher risk. One review of this condition says that about three-quarters of those people would go on to make a good recovery, but a small number, say one or two people, might die within a month of the clot. The European medicines regulator has said that by mid-March, they might have expected to see between one and two cases of this clot in people under 50 given the vaccine, but they had seen 12 - about nine times higher than they would expect. How does that compare to the risks of clots from the pill? These clots happen more often to pregnant women or people taking female hormones. In general, if you're on the pill the risk is about six times higher than if you're not. So the risks of having a clot for those taking a contraceptive pill seem, at first glance, to be in a similar ballpark to the risks potentially linked to the AZ vaccine, but we can't know for sure with the data we have. To be really sure, we would need to compare them directly in a single study. And whether or not you take a medicine depends on the benefits, as well as the risk. What are the benefits of taking the vaccine? If you delayed vaccinations for our 10 million people by a week, about 16,000 might catch coronavirus, based on current levels of the virus. If they were all older adults, say 60-year-olds, maybe 1,000 would end up in hospital and 300 of them might be expected to die, far more than the 10 deaths from clots after vaccination that we mentioned earlier. But for younger adults the risks of hospitalisation or death are considerably lower. Given the same number of infected 40-year-olds, 16 might be expected to die. And the number of expected fatalities would be even lower for people in their 20s and 30s. So for younger age groups the choice over whether to have the AZ vaccine is not as clear cut, especially when there are so many uncertainties in all these figures. But death isn't the only issue. About a quarter of people who end up in intensive care with Covid have some form of clot resulting from the virus. And long Covid is more likely to affect 30-year-olds than 70-year-olds. On average, just over 2,000 of our group would still be dealing with Covid symptoms three months later, and more than half of them would be limited in their daily activities by those symptoms. While there's no simple number for everyone, for most people with a high risk of catching Covid or dying from Covid, the current data suggests very strongly \"your chances of remaining alive and well will go up if you take the vaccine and will go down if you don't\" as JCVI member Adam Finn explains. But it does change for younger people. England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty says: \"The closer you get to someone who's right down at 20, and otherwise blameless in their health, the more you have to think through these really very rare side effects - the risk/benefits might get closer to parity.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article said that the annual incidence of CVT in the general population was 40 per 10,000,000 instead of 140 per 10,000,000.", "summary": "Pour la plupart des personnes à qui l'on propose actuellement le vaccin Oxford-AstraZeneca, les avantages l'emportent clairement sur les risques."}

Born in New York in 1916, he rose to prominence during Hollywood's \"golden age\", earning his first Oscar nomination for the 1949 film Champion. He was also the father of Oscar-winning actor Michael Douglas. His son Michael said in a statement: \"It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today.\" \"To the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies... but to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad,\" it read in part. \"Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad - I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\" Michael's wife and Kirk's daughter-in-law, Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones, posted a photo of the two together, writing: \"I shall love you for the rest of my life. I miss you already.\" An icon who defied convention Analysis by Peter Bowes, BBC News, Los Angeles When I met Kirk Douglas in 2008 he was a sprightly 91. He talked about his advancing years and the impact a stroke, in 1996, had on his skills as an actor. \"I couldn't talk at all,\" he told me. \"So what does an actor do who can't talk? He waits for silent pictures to come back! That's a corny joke,\" he chuckled. Douglas was particularly proud of his role in ending the Hollywood blacklist, when he defied the ban on working with filmmakers with alleged communist ties or sympathies. He said he drew on \"the impulsive qualities of younger Kirk\" in making his decision to give the blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo a screen credit under his own name for his work on Spartacus. We discussed his passion for working with young people. He had started writing a blog to encourage young Americans to vote in that year's presidential election. Douglas and his wife donated millions of dollars to charitable causes and helped build hundreds of school playgrounds. He said their philosophy was: \"Before you die, try to do something for other people.\" Douglas was prolific as a film actor, with more than 90 credits to his name - ranging from the 1940s to the 2000s. He is perhaps best-known for Spartacus, a Stanley Kubrick film which won four Oscars and was so popular that its iconic \"I am Spartacus\" scene entered the pop cultural lexicon. Douglas was himself nominated for an Oscar three times - for Champion (1949), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), and Lust for Life (1956). He eventually won the honorary award in 1996 in recognition of his 50 years in the industry. He faced difficulties in his personal life. He narrowly survived a helicopter crash in 1991 that left two people dead. Five years later, he suffered a major stroke that affected his speech. And in 2004, his son Eric died at the age of 46 of an accidental drug overdose. In his later years, he turned his attention to charity. He donated millions of dollars to charitable causes and helped fund an Alzheimer's unit at a retirement home in Los Angeles. World-famous director Steven Spielberg, who knew Douglas personally, told the Hollywood Reporter that he made a \"breathtaking body of work\". \"Kirk retained his movie star charisma right to the end of his wonderful life and I'm honoured to have been a small part of his last 45 years,\" Spielberg said. After the news of his death broke, fans gathered at his star set in the ground on the Hollywood walk of fame. \"He was one of the last Hollywood legends of the golden era. That's it.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari signed the landmark agreement at the African Union (AU) summit in Niger. The first step is to cut tariffs for goods from countries within the bloc but the timeframe to do this is yet to be announced. The AU says that the African Continental Free Trade Area - called AfCFTA - will create the world's largest free trade area. It also estimates that implementing AfCFTA will lead to around a 60% boost in intra-African trade by 2022. Only 16% of international trade by African countries takes place between African countries, according to research by the African Development Bank in 2014. At the moment some of that intra-Africa trade ranges from fresh fish from the Seychelles to petrol from Angola. Why is it a big deal that Nigeria signed up? By Mayeni Jones, Nigeria correspondent AfCFTA hit a hurdle last year when Nigeria pulled out days before the country was due to sign the agreement. Nigeria is Africa's biggest economy and has long been a regional leader so, when it stalled, observers questioned if the African trade bloc would ever actually happen. President Muhammadu Buhari said he needed further consultations in Nigeria. Since then, the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiation says it has consulted with 27 groups, including trade unions. Nigeria has a lot to gain from increasing access to its goods and services to a wider African market. But many of those consulted also feared increased regional integration would lead to unfair competition for jobs and the goods they produce. With Nigeria signed up, AfCFTA's dream of increasing intra-Africa trade, which currently lags behind the volume of trade the continent does with Europe, is now one step closer. Now that AfCFTA can offer access to the enormous Nigerian market, they are in a much stronger position to negotiate with regional bodies in other parts of the world. Why was Eritrea left out? Eritrea did not participate in the negotiations because of their conflict with Ethiopia, according to the Commissioner for Trade and Industry of the AU Commission Albert Muchanga. He adds that now the two countries are at peace and Eritrea has asked the AU to go through the agreement with them. \"So over time they are going to come on board\" he said. What are free trade agreements? Free trade agreements are designed to cut trade tariffs between member countries. Tariffs are a form of tax, like a border tax. They are placed on goods coming into a country for a range of reasons, sometimes to try and protect a home-made product. The purest free trade agreement (FTA) removes all border taxes or trade barriers on goods. They get rid of quotas too, so there is no limit to the amount of trade you can do. FTAs also help make a country's exports cheaper and give easier entry to other markets. They come in all sorts of forms and with different rules but in short, they make trade between countries as liberal as possible and allow for more rules-based competition.", "summary": "Le Nigeria, la première économie africaine, a signé l'accord de libre-échange visant à accroître les échanges commerciaux entre les pays africains."}

Techniques used included consistent bedtimes, avoiding caffeine and getting plenty of morning sunshine. The researchers say their approach may seem obvious, but could make an important difference to people's lives. Everyone has a body clock whose rhythms follow the rising and the setting of the sun. It is why we sleep at night. But some people's clocks run later than others. Morning-led \"larks\" tend to wake early, but struggle to stay up in the evening; night owls are the opposite, preferring a lie-in and remaining active late into the night. The problem for many night owls is fitting into a nine-to-five world, with the morning alarm waking you up hours before your body is ready. Being a night owl has been linked to worse health. Scientists studied 21 \"extreme night owls\" who were going to bed, on average, at 02:30 and not waking until after 10:00. Their instructions were to: After three weeks, people had successfully shifted their body clocks two hours earlier in the day, the analysis by the University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Monash University showed. The results, in the journal Sleep Medicine, showed people still got the same hours of shut-eye. But they reported lower levels of sleepiness, stress and depression, while tests showed their reaction times also improved. \"Establishing simple routines could help night owls adjust their body clocks and improve their overall physical and mental health,\" said Prof Debra Skene from the University of Surrey. \"Insufficient levels of sleep and circadian [body clock] misalignment can disrupt many bodily processes, putting us at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes.\" One of the main cues the body uses for syncing with the passage of the sun is light - hence advice to expose the body to more during the day and less at night. Having inconsistent sleeping and waking times can also disrupt the body's internal clock (known as a circadian rhythm). The techniques deployed may seem like obvious sleep hygiene advice, but each is used to help train the body clock. What the researchers did not know was whether those hard-wired to sleep late would respond to the change of habits. \"What isn't obvious is, when you have these extreme night owls, can you do anything about that?\" Dr Andrew Bagshaw, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC. \"These are relatively simple things anyone can do that makes an impact, and that to me is surprising. \"Being able to take a decent chunk of the population and help them feel better without a particularly onerous intervention is quite important.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "Changer ses habitudes de sommeil peut modifier votre horloge biologique et vous aider à améliorer votre bien-être, selon des chercheurs anglais et australiens."}

By the next morning, her friends and neighbours in the capital, Nairobi, had begun to avoid her, fearing she had become infected with coronavirus. It is unclear who leaked the information that she had organised to have the patient tested - but both her name and number were leaked on social media. The patient ended up being negative, but that news never filtered out - the damage was done. She began to receive phone calls from strangers - some wanting to know where she worked - and anxious friends wanting to find out her status. \"Out there it was like I was already a Covid suspect. It really affected me. The story was even on the media. It was on TV,\" Ms Mwabili told the BBC. One neighbour shouted to her: \"I hear you are the one catching coronavirus patients.\" An acquaintance told her husband that she really pitied him \"because of what has happened to your wife\". \"Do you imagine, up to today that lady friend has never bothered to call me to find out how I'm doing after that incident,\" she said. She is not the only Kenyan who has faced coronavirus-linked stigma. Even some of those who have recovered have found it hard to be accepted back into their communities. Recently Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe spoke about someone who had fully recovered but was not allowed to re-join their local choir. The ministry says others have found that after leaving hospital even their families have been stigmatised. Cyberbullying survivors And the fear is pervasive. One man I contacted to find out about life in a quarantine centre refused to answer my questions as he feared the stigma he would be subjected to afterwards. He had been sent to the facility as a precautionary measure for 14 days after some people in the apartment block in which he lived tested positive for coronavirus - though he never contracted the virus. You may also be interested in: Even before the country registered its first coronavirus infection, an MP's xenophobic Facebook message went viral in February as he called for his constituents to avoid nationals from China, where the virus originated. In April, Brenda Cherotich, among the first coronavirus patients to recover, was interviewed on television about her experiences. Officials wanted her to be the beacon of hope, to show that people could survive the illness - instead she was subjected to cyberbullying. Not long after that, a 27-year-old man in the coastal city of Mombasa was \"condemned to death by medics\" who abandoned him in his hour of need fearing he had Covid-19, his father told The People Daily newspaper. 'I was scared to go out' For the nurse, Ms Mwabili, it all started when Davis Muturi walked into private Catholic Church-run hospital where she worked at the end of March. The 40-year-old chef had returned from the US a week before. He had gone into self-isolation on his return, asking his family to move in with relatives as a precaution. \"I had a one-month-old baby who I had never seen, and my wife was shocked and worried that I was sending the family away and did not want to see them. But after explaining, she understood that it was for the good of the family,\" he told the BBC. After seven days, he went to the hospital for a test because he was scared by reports on social media about the virus - and he wanted to be sure he didn't have it. \"The way they put it is like everyone who came into the country was already affected,\" he said. But after he did the test his name and phone number were also leaked - with people alleging online that he had coronavirus. Even though he had tested negative, he was afraid of leaving his house - scared he would be accused of deliberately trying to infect other people. He contacted Ms Mwabili to see if she knew how their information had been shared: \"She told me that her colleagues were even asking her why she was not isolating herself. But I was not even positive.\" Leaked police memo Ms Mwabili can only point to a visit by the police on the evening of Mr Muturi's check-up. The officers had wanted information about suspected Covid-19 patients as part of an ongoing investigation into an escape from a coronavirus quarantine centre. It seems a police memo about their visit was leaked. \"I don't know exactly how it leaked with my name and details, as well as that of my client,\" she said. The hospital has complained about the leak, and police say the matter is under investigation. Ms Mwabili says what made it more challenging was after the leak, she went down with tonsillitis for a week. \"When I resumed at work, some of my colleagues were asking, 'Did you go on quarantine?'... You can just suspect what was going through their minds.\" More than a month later, Ms Mwabili says she is a stronger person after going through the experience. It has made her more determined to do her job well as \"each person, whether positive or negative, needs our services\". For Mr Muturi, the moment he learnt that he was Covid-19-free, he could not wait to meet his new baby. \"That very day, they came back immediately, I couldn't let my family stay for another night away from me.\"", "summary": "Une infirmière kenyane s'est sentie exclue de sa communauté et harcelée après avoir pratiqué un test Covid-19 sur un patient alors qu'elle était en service de nuit."}

Is your mother a butcher? Did God use his last piece of clay on you because you have large breasts and a big behind.' \"It's a lot for us to take in when we walk out here (in the streets),\" says the 22-year-old. But over time, Ms Yusuf has learnt to fight back and she is helping other women in Kibera claim their voices back in situations where some women say they feel powerless. Using chalk and markers, in a campaign dubbed \"Chalk Back\", Ms Yusuf and other girls and women are writing down their experiences of street harassment. The campaign, they hope, will spur conversations around the damaging nature of street sexual harassment. \"Nowadays, when the men insult me, I stop and ask them to their faces, why they are insulting me. However, for underage girls fighting back may be harder,\" she says. \"That's why campaigns like these are important. More of us need to push back and tell people it is not okay to speak to women this way.\" Shocking messages \"Respect my body,\" one message on the road screams. Others, written in Swahili, reveal more disturbing messages. \"Unaringa, wewe ni vajo\" (You think you are too good for us, yet you're still a virgin). \"Chura hii\" (slang for prostitute, which also means frog in Swahili).

Sometimes we're even likened to animals. \"It affects one's self esteem. When I sit by myself, I wonder: 'Am I really as worthless or as ugly as that person has said I am?'\" But it's not just the emotional cost of street harassment that is the problem. No-go areas for women According to the UN, the lack of conclusive and comparative national data and policies on street harassment within countries is one among many of the challenges when it comes to combating the problem and ensuring the safety of girls and women in public spaces. A 2019 Plan International street harassment survey of five cities revealed that less than one in 10 of the women and girls interviewed reported their experiences to the authorities. This is because women were unsure of what exactly authorities could do, and whether street harassment could be termed as a \"serious\" crime. Experts agree that street harassment continues to curtail women's participation in public spaces socially and economically.

The data centre she worked in was hot, so she asked for another one. However, she says the Google subcontractor refused to give her one. That moment sparked a chain reaction that led to an announcement last week. Google signed a statement saying the company's workers had the right to discuss pay and conditions with each other. It might seem bizarre that even needed to be said. But in actual fact it was the culmination of Shannon's battle with the company. Her story is one of management overreach, a story that shines a light on managerial practices that have become synonymous with Big Tech. Shannon finished her history degree in 2018 and started working at a Google data centre in South Carolina the following February, earning $15 (£10.90) an hour. \"You're fixing the servers, which includes swapping out hard drives, swapping motherboards, lifting heavy batteries, they're like 30lb (13.6kg) each,\" she says. \"It's really difficult work.\" Google's offices are famed for being creative, alternative and fun - with table tennis tables, free snacks and music rooms. However, what Shannon describes sounds less idyllic. \"People aren't playing games all day like you see in the movies… the data centre is completely different,\" she says. Shannon was a contractor at Google. That means that although she worked in a Google data centre, she was actually employed by a subcontractor called Modis, part of a group of companies owned by another firm, Adecco. That complex arrangement has become increasingly common at Google. About half of the people who work for the company are reportedly employed as contractors. It also makes working out who actually carries the can for managerial mistakes complex. But we'll get to that later. Shannon says when the pandemic hit, the work got harder. The minimum number of jobs per shift increased. But there was a sweetener. \"Around the time of May 2020, Google announced that they were going to handle the pandemic in an honourable way. They said that they were going to give bonuses to every employee, including contractors, who work in person,\" she says. \"The time came that we were supposed to get that bonus and it never appeared in any of our bank accounts. We started getting concerned like, you know, I really could use this extra money.\" It was around this point that she says employees started talking to each other about the bonus, and how much they were entitled to receive. \"We started asking each other about pay, but any time it came up in front of management we were told not to talk about it.\" Shannon says she was even sent a message by a manager saying: \"It is never ok to discuss compensation with your peers\". She shared it with the BBC. Shannon did eventually receive her bonus, but says she had become disillusioned. She had hoped to get a full-time job at Google. However, she noticed a culture of \"perma-temps\", temporary staff who she says would never get made staff, no matter how much they tried. Frustrated by management, Shannon reached what she says was her breaking point. \"It's very hot in the data centres - about 85F (29.5C). So Google issued me a water bottle, but the cap on it broke.\" She says the same thing happened to her colleague, a full-time Google employee. However, Shannon says although her colleague was given a new bottle, she wasn't. She went home and typed up a Facebook post. Eventually, she says she had \"had enough\". \"The next day, I was at work, I got called into a conference room with all, for the most, the managers present. And they told me that my Facebook post was in violation of the non-disclosure agreement, and that I was a security risk and needed to hand over my badge and my laptop immediately, and be escorted off site.\" The Alphabet Workers Union was set up in January 2021 for Google workers. It is not recognised by the National Labor Relations Board, an independent government agency, and is sometimes referred to as a \"minority union\". The vast majority of Google workers aren't members, but Shannon was and the union took up her case. In February, they filed two cases on her behalf under unfair labour practice laws. One that she had been suspended illegally - for talking about supporting a union. The other that her managers had asked her, illegally, not to discuss her wages. Last month Google, Modis and the Alphabet Workers Union reached a settlement. Shannon's suspension was overturned. Google signed a document saying its employees \"have the right to discuss wage rates, bonuses, and working conditions\". It was a victory for both Shannon and the newly-formed union. \"People who work in warehouses and data centres for these trillion dollar companies are tired of even their smallest rights being trampled on. And they're realising that the companies aren't listening to their workers. So we're going to make them.\" Last week, Amazon workers in Alabama voted on whether they should unionise. Amazon is desperate to avoid workers unionising. The result is expected soon. It's the latest battle between Big Tech and some workers who feel, to put it mildly, unloved. \"I think that one of the biggest things that people can learn is that not all Google employees make six figures… and even on the lowest level at Google, they have so much power - so much more power than they realise,\" said Shannon. And as for Google? Well it didn't admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and didn't admit to being a \"joint employer\" of contract staff. The BBC put Shannon's story to Google but it said it had nothing further to add. Adecco has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Shannon doesn't want to return to a Google data centre, and ultimately wants to do a PhD in history. But she has already contributed to the history books, a rare win by an employee against a tech giant. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Kylie Jenner - who when the series started was just nine-years-old - is now 21 and a billionaire. With an estimated fortune of $1bn (£760m), according to Forbes magazine, the make-up mogul is by far the wealthiest member of the ubiquitous Kardashian clan, which is led by matriarch and \"momager\" Kris Jenner. However, the rest of her siblings aren't exactly scrabbling around the back of the sofa for loose change. Kim Kardashian West is a multi-millionaire thanks to her own beauty line, perfumes and her \"kimojis\"; Kendall Jenner is an international fashion model; Khloe Kardashian has her own jeans business Good American and eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian has benefitted from product endorsements and collaborations with fashion retailers. Blurring the personal and the professional coupled with their astonishing reach on social media platforms has proved lucrative. The sisters' combined following totals 537 million, allowing them to squeeze millions of dollars from exploiting pop culture. Alexander McKelvie, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, also believes the show is carefully scripted. \"If you were to analyse the show, you would think it is very spontaneous,\" he said. \"But it is most likely scripted and planned and very curated to provide a clear and compelling message about what the producers and the Kardashian family want to have revealed about them.\" How have the Kardashians made their millions? This season of Keeping up with the Kardashians is focused squarely on a \"scandal\" involving Khloe Kardashian, her former partner Tristan Thompson and an alleged \"hook-up\" with Kylie Jenner's best friend, Jordyn Woods. In the show, Khloe laments: \"It just sucks it had to be so public. I'm not just a TV show. Like, this is my life.\" Around the time the alleged tryst emerged, the price of the Jordy Lip Kit, which was a liquid lipstick and lip pencil that was part of a wider collaboration between Kylie and Jordyn, was discounted by 50%. It soon sold out. In an interview with The New York Times, Kylie Jenner said she didn't know the price has been cut, adding: \"I would never do something like that\". But the fact is, the scandal shifted units. \"Essentially, their entire lives are on display the entire time and I think that it does make them appear more relatable to certain consumers,\" said Alison Gaither, beauty analyst at market research company Mintel. In that first episode, audiences also see Khloe at a photo shoot for her jeans company, Kim and Kylie discussing a perfume collaboration and Kim's husband, the rapper Kanye West, getting in on the act by talking about his own projects. Coinciding with all this was the launch of Kourtney Kardashian's own lifestyle blog Poosh - a bit like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop website but with considerably more flesh on display. Like most things Kardashian, Poosh was announced via Kourtney's Instagram account, as was Khloe's jeans business last year, and the social media platform was central to the success of Kylie's cosmetics business. Ms Gaither said: \"What they've done the best is really leverage their social media following to create a brand that their followers actually want, especially when we think of Kylie Jenner.\" When Kylie first launched her lip kits back in November 2015, she was able to market to millions of fans directly through her Instagram account which meant she was able to dispense with the cost of marketing and get an instant reaction on what people did or didn't like. Lewis Sheats, assistant vice provost of entrepreneurship at North Carolina State University, said: \"If you think 20 years ago for an entrepreneur to get feedback from 20 customers they might actually have to invite them in or build a product and get it in their hands or stand on a street corner and survey them. \"On a social media platform, they can reach hundreds of thousands of people within seconds and get feedback on a concept.\" Have the Kardashians always made money? Some of the deals that the family struck in the early days of their fame, in particular involving older siblings Kourtney, Kim and Khloe, haven't always been smooth-sailing. The sisters became the faces of a make-up brand called Khroma Beauty through a licensing agreement. But after launching in 2012, the line was soon pulled from stores amid copyright infringement claims. It rebranded as Kardashian Beauty, but even then the legal problems continued. It was only very recently that the family was able to extricate itself from the situation. They also launched the Kardashian Kard, a pre-paid credit card aimed at teenagers and parents who wanted to track their spending. It was soon scrapped, however, after Connecticut's former attorney general Richard Blumenthal said he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the card's high fees \"combined with its appeal to financially unsophisticated young adults\". Even now, not everything they touch turns to gold. Kendall Jenner's stint as the face of Pepsi collapsed in a storm of anger after she starred in an advert that some claimed trivialised the Black Lives Matter movement. Pepsi pulled the advert the day after it aired. Mum of three (soon to be four) Kim Kardashian West provoked the ire of the US Food and Drug Administration when she promoted an anti-morning sickness medicine. And members of the family have garnered significant backlash for taking money to promote weight loss products. Ex-Radio 1 presenter Jameela Jamil, who has a campaign around body positivity, described Kim Kardashian West as a \"terrible and toxic influence on young girls\". Where next for the family? The family's current television contract runs until this year and at this stage it isn't clear if the series will continue. Viewing figures for the last season of the show waned as the 1.3 million who tuned in for the premiere dropped to 851,000 by the end of its run. If the programme is nearing its end, would the family still have the same degree of success without it? \"They would certainly not get as much free advertising,\" said Professor McKelvie. \"But they've been successful in finding other ways to remain in the media by creating fake conflicts, whether they are self-made or not, that is free advertising.\"", "summary": "La série de télé-réalité \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" vient de revenir pour sa 16ème saison, synonyme de nouvelles disputes familiales mais aussi de mise en avant de leurs gammes de produits."}

Hoarding by wealthy nations, funding shortfalls, regulations and cold chain requirements have slowed the process of rolling out the vaccines. \"The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure and the price will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the poorest countries,\" warned WHO head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus. Calls for equity have been growing. Close to 40 million doses have been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries, compared to just 25 doses given in just one of the lowest-income countries, according to Dr Tedros. \"Not 25 million, not 25,000, just 25,\" he said, without saying which country. So far, none of the main, Western vaccines has yet been administered in Africa, almost two months after the first doses were rolled out in Europe. A coalition of organisations and activists dubbed The People's Vaccine Alliance found that \"rich nations representing just 14% of the world's population had bought up more than half (53%) of all the most promising vaccines.\" That included all of Moderna's vaccines for 2021 and 96% of Pfizer's expected production. Canada topped the chart, according to the data by analytics company Airfinity, \"with enough doses to vaccinate each Canadian five times\". Much of that demand has to be met before lower income countries can have a turn. 'Don't look for super profits' In Africa, the situation rekindles memories of the 1990s, when antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV/Aids was made in the United States. Even though the continent had a much bigger population of people infected with HIV, it took at least six years before the life-saving treatment could be available for Africans. Twelve million people died in Africa from Aids-related complications in a decade, even as mortality in the US dropped drastically, according to analyses by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. UNAids Executive Director Winnie Byanyima has been at the forefront of those calling for fairness from Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers. \"We're not asking them to make loses,\" she told the BBC. With the ARVs, it was pressure from people living with HIV and champions of the right to life that got governments to allow for the production of generic treatments which were much more affordable. \"The price [of antiretroviral treatment per person] dropped from $10,000 per year [per person] to just $100 per year.\" She wants the same approach for the Covid-19 vaccine,urging the pharmaceutical industry \"not to be driven by the desire for super profits\". They can still make profits even if they share their formulae, she added. 'Queue-jumping' The WHO head is also calling for equity: \"Even as they speak the language of equitable access, some countries and companies continue to prioritise bilateral deals, going around Covax, driving up prices and attempting to jump to the front of the queue,\" he said. The Covax facility is an initiative of the WHO and the Vaccine Alliance to equitably distribute Covid-19 vaccines across the world. \"Most supply of the leading vaccines was pre-ordered by wealthy nations even before the safety and efficacy data was made available,\" said Dr Richard Mihigo, head of immunisation and vaccine development at the WHO Africa office. Asked why Covax didn't do the same, he said securing funding was the first task the initiative engaged in. So far, $6bn has been raised out of a target of $8bn for 92 middle- and low-income countries, according to Thabani Maphosa of the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. So far, the facility has secured two billion doses for this group of countries, which includes all of Africa. Some 600 million are for the continent. The African Union has made arrangements for member states to apply for $7bn funding from lenders, which would cover up to 270 million vaccines, according to its current chairperson, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. 'Mammoth operation' But it is not just the purchase of vaccines that needs funding. Countries have also been ramping up their cold chains as they prepare for their arrival. These are especially important for the Pfizer vaccine, which must be kept at -70C. The UN children's agency, Unicef, which usually deals with distribution of childhood vaccines, will be handling the logistics of delivering Covid-19 vaccines under the Covax facility. The agency is preparing to transport at least twice its usual capacity - what it calls \"a mammoth and historic logistical operation\". More about coronavirus in Africa: But before it can be done, countries need to have ready infrastructure to receive and administer the doses. Benjamin Schreiber, who is coordinating the Covax facility for Unicef, says he is \"worried that we haven't resourced the roll-out and the preparation enough\". \"What we're seeing in the roll-out in some of the high-income countries is that it's complicated, it needs to be resourced and properly planned, and there haven't been enough global resources to lower-income countries,\" he told the BBC. In spite of the shortfalls, he paints a more optimistic picture of the continent's ability to introduce new vaccines. \"Africa has a lot more experience than many other regions - we've done so many vaccine introductions over the last 10 years and there's good expertise to organise targeted vaccination campaigns.\" He adds that some countries that have dealt with Ebola also have expertise and ultra-cold chain experience and infrastructure. Even before the pandemic hit, the organisation says it has been supporting cold-chain infrastructure in low-income countries, including the installation of 70,000 fridges, half of which are solar-powered. The country-by-country status was not immediately available. Mr Maphosa from Gavi said countries were currently submitting documents to the facility to inform it of their readiness to roll out vaccines. Only one vaccine approved by WHO But even if they were ready, regulatory issues still stand in the way. Under the Covax facility, only WHO-approved vaccines can be bought. So far, only Pfizer's has been listed for emergency use by the WHO. The process to approve Moderna and Astrazeneza vaccines is ongoing. \"Vaccines that are being recommended for emergency use need absolutely to meet minimum standards for safety and efficacy,\" said Dr Mihigo. More developed countries such as the US and EU states have regulatory agencies that \"complement\" WHO's work and could therefore roll out vaccines without the body's approval. However, in the developing world, many countries rely on the WHO to do the due diligence, adds Dr Mihigo. That assurance of quality has a direct impact on people's willingness to take vaccines. A study conducted by the Africa CDC and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the last quarter of 2020 found that a majority of Africans - four out of every five - would be willing to take a Covid-19 vaccine \"if it was deemed safe and effective\". Several countries have however rolled out vaccines that have yet to be approved by the WHO. \"Our advice is for countries to rely not just on the body's pre-qualification, but also any other competent 'Stringent Regulatory Authority',\" said Dr Mihigo. The Seychelles, Morocco and Egypt are administering the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine and Guinea, the Russian Sputnik V. Africa CDC's director John Nkengasong said there were no negotiations going on to purchase these two vaccines, but that the regional body was \"in talks\" with the producing countries. More and more African countries are showing interest in these two vaccine candidates as the wait for the leading ones from the West continues. Aids lessons 'not learnt' The BBC could not establish a specific date from the official involved of when the Covax vaccines could be delivered to the continent. The most optimistic estimate was February but stretching to the end of March for the initial consignments of the Covax facility. \"We want to get the first doses out as fast as possible,\" said Unicef's Mr Schreiber. The 270 million doses secured directly by the African Union are expected to be delivered from April. No doses from WHO-approved vaccines are currently available for distribution on the continent. \"That lesson [from the HIV antiretroviral treatment] has still not been learnt,\" said Ms Byanyima from UNAids.", "summary": "L'Afrique devra attendre \"des semaines, voire des mois\" avant de recevoir les vaccins Covid-19 approuvés par l'Organisation mondiale de la santé, selon divers responsables travaillant à l'obtention de doses pour le continent."}

Study lead Dr Kelly Lambert said the rats felt more relaxed during the task, a finding that could help with the development of non-pharmaceutical treatments for mental illness. The rats were not required to take a driving test at the end of the study. How did the rats learn to drive? Dr Lambert and her colleagues built a tiny electric car by attaching a clear plastic jar to an aluminium plate, fitted to a set of wheels. A copper wire was then threaded horizontally across the jar - the cab of the car - to form three bars, left, right and centre. To drive the car, a rat would sit on the aluminium plate and touch the copper wire. The circuit was then complete, and the animal could select the direction in which they wanted to travel. After months of training, the rats learned not only how to make the ratmobile move but also how to change direction, researchers wrote in the journal Behavioural Brain Research. What did they find? Some of the rats in the experiment had been raised in a lab, while others lived in \"enriched environments\" - that is, they had more natural habitats. The rats raised in \"enriched environments\" were significantly better drivers than the lab rats. After the trials, researchers collected the rats' faeces to test for the stress hormone corticosterone, as well as for dehydroepiandrosterone, an anti-stress hormone.

Some staff and students staged protests calling for the two-day event to be cancelled. Posters appeared around the university campus and online, with angry messages such as: \"Witches and Wizards, No Vacancy\" and \"Don't Pollute Our Environment\". The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), an influential group which represents clergymen, called on Christians to pray against the event. \"We have had enough of ungodly activities in this country,\" said Godwin Madu, a PFN official. \"We will not hand [the state] over to witches.\" Every ethnic group in Nigeria has a name for females and males who are believed to openly or secretly collaborate with dark forces to invoke harm upon others. The English words \"witch\" and \"wizard\" are insufficient to convey the depths of evil culturally associated with such people - their \"manipulations\" are often blamed for a variety of afflictions, from disease to infertility, poverty and failure. So entrenched is the belief in, and abhorrence of, witchcraft that a section of the Nigerian criminal code, originally introduced under British colonial rule, still forbids its practice, and it is punishable by a jail term. While reports of convictions are not common, the media regularly features stories of people being branded witches and being brutalised or lynched. Rights groups condemn the killings, saying superstitious beliefs result in the loss of innocent lives, often those of women and children. This was not the first time an event associated with witchcraft had led to a furore in Nigeria. Beliefs about witches in Nigeria: Source: Journal of International Women's Studies In the early 1990s, Benin City in Edo State in the south was billed as the venue for a global conference of witches. Nearly 10,000 witches were expected from around the world. Many Nigerians were disturbed by the news. The drama that ensued is still narrated from pulpits across the country. I have heard it over and over again, from Christians and even from people who do not attend church. 'God need not waste His time' The late Benson Idahosa, a popular preacher who is regarded as the father of the Pentecostal movement in Nigeria, called on national TV for the witches' conference to be called off. \"Not even God can stop it,\" responded one of the organisers. \"He's correct,\" Idahosa replied, \"Because God need not waste His time when I'm here. I can handle this.\" The conference was eventually cancelled. Idahosa gloated publicly that the international witches were unable to convene in Benin City because they were unable to get Nigerian visas. Apparently, the flamboyant preacher had influenced Nigeria's then-military ruler, Ibrahim Babangida, who issued the relevant instruction to Nigerian embassies around the world. You may also be interested in: The Nsukka conference must have evoked memories of Idahosa's famous confrontation with witches almost 30 years ago. The protesters and PFN were probably hoping for a similar victory. But it turned out there were no identifiable witches to forestall. The event was a gathering of intellectuals \"to evaluate the belief in witchcraft and its impact on Nigerian society\". \"Apart from rumours about witchcraft, can we intelligently discuss the phenomenon of witchcraft?\" commented Egodi Uchendu, a professor of history and international studies and one of the conference organisers. \"Can we delineate its evolving dynamics, especially in regard to human and societal development? What does belief in witchcraft symbolise for civilians, the military, scholars, and others?\" 'Nothing evil' However, in deference to the public outcry and at the vice-chancellor's request, the organisers did away with the word \"witchcraft\" on all publicity material. They also changed the theme to \"Dimensions of Human Behaviour\". The two-day event then went ahead. The keynote speaker had backed out because of the protests but the venue was moved to a larger hall to accommodate the crowd - many were drawn in by the accompanying hullaballoo. \"We didn't change anything in the conference. We merely modified the title,\" said Benedict Ijomah, a professor of political sociology who participated in the conference. \"All the papers were the same... You could just modify a sentence and there would be peace.\" Also in attendance at the conference were clergy from local churches. The opening prayer was conducted by a Catholic priest, the proceedings were moderated by an Anglican priest, and music was provided by a choir from the university chapel. \"There was nothing evil,\" said Damian Apata, a lecturer in the department of English and literary studies. But prayer alone is not going to end the belief in witchcraft. It has persisted \"even as people pray against witches and wizards\", said Prof Uchendu. To combat the beliefs, education levels, therefore, need to improve so that, the professor said, a \"pro-positive developmental mindset\" emerges in Nigeria.

Mr Girmay is reported to have been taken to a military camp in Mekelle. The BBC is yet to establish the reason for his detention, but has expressed its concern to the Ethiopian authorities. A local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency, respectively - have also been detained in recent days. Ethiopia's government has been fighting rebel forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. Both AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to cover the conflict. Eyewitnesses told the BBC the operation to detain Mr Girmay was carried out by soldiers in military uniform. A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"We have expressed our concern to the Ethiopian authorities and are awaiting their response.\" Fighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. There is international concern over growing reports of atrocities committed by all sides and the worsening humanitarian crisis, correspondents say. An official of Ethiopia's ruling party recently warned that measures would be taken against people they said were \"misleading international media\".

It is reported that tens of thousands of US organisations may be impacted. The US has long accused the Chinese government of cyber-espionage, something Beijing denies. Ms Psaki told reporters that the White House was \"concerned that there are a large number of victims\" and said the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft's servers \"could have far reaching impacts\". On Saturday, the US National Security Council said it was \"essential that any organisation with a vulnerable server take immediate measures\" to determine if they had been targeted. What do we know about the hack? Microsoft executive Tom Burt revealed the breach in a blog post on Tuesday and announced updates to counter security flaws which he said had allowed hackers to gain access to Microsoft Exchange servers. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributed the attacks with \"high confidence\" to a \"state-sponsored threat actor\" based in China which they named Hafnium. The tech giant said Hafnium had tried to steal information from groups such as infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions and defence contractors. A spokesman for the Chinese government told Reuters news agency that the country was not behind the hack. Beijing has repeatedly rejected US accusations of cyber-crime. More than 20,000 organisations have been compromised in the US with many more affected worldwide, Reuters reported. Brian Krebs, an industry expert and blogger, put the number higher - citing multiple security sources. \"At least 30,000 organizations across the United States - including a significant number of small businesses, towns, cities and local governments - have over the past few days been hacked by an unusually aggressive Chinese cyber-espionage unit that's focused on stealing email from victim organizations,\" he wrote in a blog post. Mr Krebs warned attacks had \"dramatically stepped up\" since Microsoft's announcement. What is Microsoft doing? News of the breach prompted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) to release an emergency directive telling agencies and departments to take urgent action. Jake Sullivan, the White House National Security Adviser, has also urged network owners to download the security patches as soon as possible. Microsoft has not confirmed the reported figures but said in a further statement on Friday that it was working closely with US government agencies. It told customers \"the best protection\" was \"to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems\". However, it also said it was deploying some mitigation techniques designed to help those who are unable to upgrade quickly, but warned they were not \"a remediation if your Exchange servers have already been compromised, nor are they full protection against attack\". This is the eighth time in the past 12 months that Microsoft has publicly accused nation-state groups of targeting institutions critical to civil society. Microsoft said the attack was in no way related to the SolarWinds attack, which hit US government agencies late last year. Although Hafnium is based in China, it allegedly conducts its operations primarily from leased virtual private servers in the US, Microsoft said. China presence While many US tech firms have had a tumultuous relationship with the Chinese government, Microsoft has maintained a mainland presence since 1992. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Microsoft's business-oriented social media platform LinkedIn is still accessible in China. So, too, is its search engine Bing, although locally-grown Baidu dominates the search market.

Facebook has been put in a spin by this because user data - and the advertising it can generate - is what makes the company so profitable. This update could deal a severe blow to its business model. What's it about? The row focuses on a unique device identifier on every iPhone and iPad, called the IDFA (identifier for advertisers). Companies which sell mobile ads, including Facebook, use this IDFA to both target ads and estimate their effectiveness. The IDFA can also be paired with other tech, such as Facebook's tracking pixels or tracking cookies, which follow users around the web, to learn even more about you. But when iOS 14.5 comes out this week, the new App Tracking Transparency feature will be on by default. It will force app developers to explicitly ask for permission from users to use this IDFA. Surveys suggest, and Facebook acknowledges, that up to 80% will say no. If you want to know how much Facebook already tracks you on other sites and apps, there's a helpful tool on Facebook. Why is Apple doing this? Apple has little interest in its customers' data because it makes money from selling devices and in-app purchases, rather than from advertising. Plus it has always marketed itself as a privacy-first company. Back in 2010, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs acknowledged that some people didn't care about how much data they shared, but said they should always be informed of how it was being used. \"Privacy means people know what they're signing up for, in plain English and repeatedly... ask them, ask them every time,\" he said. More recently, in what many saw as a thinly-veiled reference to Facebook, current chief executive Tim Cook said: \"If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\" Apple is baking privacy into its systems. Its browser Safari already blocks third-party cookies by default, and last year Apple forced app providers in iOS to spell out in the App Store listings what data they collect. And Facebook isn't best pleased? Facebook has warned that the app update could cut the money earned through its ad network by half, hitting small businesses the hardest. And it argues that sharing data with advertisers is key to giving users \"better experiences\". It also says that Apple is being hypocritical, because it will force businesses to turn to subscriptions and other in-app payments for revenue, from which Apple takes a cut. As it often does when under pressure, Facebook has gone on a PR offensive. It took out adverts in national newspapers in December, featuring small businesses talking about how they only survived the pandemic thanks to targeted ads. In its latest blog, Facebook appeared to accept the changes and promised \"new advertiser experiences and measurement protocols\". It admitted that the ways digital advertisers collect and use information needed to \"evolve\" to one that will rely on \"less data\". Why should I care? In recent years, governments and regulators have become increasingly concerned about just how big and complex the ecosystem around websites, apps and social media companies has become. Here are some points to consider: What does the ad industry say? Most think that change is coming, even without the iOS update. Technology consultant Max Kalmykov wrote in Medium that advertisers had to \"prepare for the next, privacy-focused era of digital advertising\". This may include contextual ads, such as fashion-related ads appearing only on websites about fashion rather than randomly following people across the web. Ad placements on podcasts or with influencers would be another non-intrusive way of advertising, he suggested. Meanwhile, Apple says that it supports the ad industry, and has introduced new free tools that let advertisers know how successful a campaign has been, without revealing individual users' identities. Are there other ways of tracking people? If you don't have a unique number attached to a device, it doesn't mean that you can't be tracked. Device fingerprinting combines certain attributes of a device - such as the operating system it uses, the type and version of web browser and the device's IP address to identify it uniquely. It is an imperfect art, but one that is gaining traction in the advertising world. The Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) may sound like something from a fantasy novel, but actually it is an idea from Google about how to continue tracking people in a privacy-friendly way. The idea is that a browser enabled with FLoC would collect information about browsing habits and assign users to a group, or flock, with similar browsing histories. Each will share an ID which will indicate their interests to advertisers. Mozilla, Firefox and others aren't keen on the scheme, according to The Verge, while privacy advocates Electronic Frontiers Foundation said it was a \"terrible idea\", suggesting Google should ensure that browsers \"work for users, not for advertisers\".", "summary": "Une nouvelle fonctionnalité est introduite sur les iPhones et les iPads cette semaine, ce qui provoque un énorme désaccord entre Apple et Facebook."}

His career reached an embarrassing end in 1981, when he was jailed for leading a failed coup in the Seychelles. Mr Hoare's son, Chris Hoare, said in a statement that his father died in a care facility in Durban, South Africa. \"Mike Hoare lived by the philosophy that you get more out of life by living dangerously, so it is all the more remarkable that he lived more than 100 years,\" he said. Accountant turned mercenary After serving in the British Army during the Second World War and reaching the rank of major, Mr Hoare began his post-war career as an accountant, running several small businesses in South Africa. But it was in 1961 that he was introduced to Moïse Tshombe - a Congolese politician and businessman who would go on to become prime minister of the Congo three years later. In 1964, Mr Tshombe hired Mr Hoare to take on the communist-backed Simba rebellion. When the campaign was completed 18 months later, Mr Hoare and his unit of mercenaries - which he nicknamed the \"Wild Geese\" - were internationally known. His fervent anti-communist beliefs earned him no fans in many nations, with East German radio regularly describing him as \"that mad bloodhound Hoare\". This led to him being nicknamed \"Mad Mike\" - a moniker with which he was delighted. In 1978, a mercenary adventure film called The Wild Geese was released. The film starred Richard Burton as Colonel Allen Faulkner, a character based heavily on Mr Hoare. But following his successful campaigns in the Congo, what came next turned him into an international laughing stock. 'The package-holiday coup' Mr Hoare appeared to be retired from military life by the start of the 1980s - but in 1981 he launched a surprise attempt at overthrowing the government of the Seychelles. It is believed that Mr Hoare knew the Seychelles well, and had a particular hatred of its socialist government under President Albert René. Having gained the tacit support of the governments of South Africa and Kenya, Mr Hoare began to plot. In October 1981 he had a cache of weapons delivered to his suburban bungalow in South Africa, which he hid in his cellar. He recruited 46 men, and with them he planned to enter the Seychelles disguised as a charitable drinking club of former rugby players. Almost all of the men managed to get through customs at Mahe airport. However, one of their group joined the wrong queue, got into an argument with a customs officer, and ended up having his bag searched. When officers found a dismantled AK-47, the man panicked and revealed that there were more weapons outside. At this point the entire plan unravelled, and amid the ensuing conflict at the airport the mercenaries commandeered an Air India plane and flew it back to South Africa. When they arrived the mercenaries were jailed for six days, and Mr Hoare and his plans - dubbed \"the package-holiday coup\" - were ridiculed in the global press. A year later they were tried for hijacking the Air India plane. Mr Hoare was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years suspended. He was released after 33 months. Mr Hoare spent his final years in South Africa, and published several memoirs - including Mercenary, The Road to Kalamata, and The Seychelles Affair.", "summary": "Michael \"Mad Mike\" Hoare, largement considéré comme le mercenaire le plus célèbre du monde, est mort à l'âge de 100 ans."}

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said they had addressed \"some of our time's most… pressing questions\" on how to achieve sustainable growth. The duo will receive nine million Swedish krona (£841,000). Prof Nordhaus, of Yale University, was the first person to create a model that described the interplay between the economy and the climate, the academy said. Prof Romer, of New York University's Stern School of Business, has shown how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to produce new ideas and innovations. \"Their findings have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge,\" the academy said in statement. Prof Romer courted controversy earlier this year when he stepped down as the World Bank's chief economist after just 15 months in the job. He had claimed that Chile's rankings in a closely watched \"Doing Business\" report may have been manipulated for political reasons under socialist president Michelle Bachelet. It came amid reports that the outspoken economist had clashed with colleagues at the Word Bank over a host of issues, including the organisation's culture and economists' use of grammar. Analysis: By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent: What these two prize winners have in common is that their research examined the unintended side effects from economic activity and how they affect growth in the long term. In the work of William Nordhaus these spill-overs are the negative consequences of climate change, which have been highlighted once again by scientists in the new report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He developed an integrated method for looking at economic activity, and its environmental consequences and for evaluating responses to it, such as carbon taxes, an approach he has advocated. Paul Romer has focussed on the positive side-effects of technological change. He argued that innovators often don't get all the benefit of what they do, so market economies left to their own devices tend not generate enough new ideas. Addressing this shortfall, he suggests, requires for well-designed government action to stimulate more innovation, such as subsides for research and development. Commenting on the prize, Prof Romer told reporters: \"I think... many people think that protecting he environment will be so costly and so hard that they just want to ignore [this]. \"[But] we can absolutely make substantial progress protecting the environment and do it without giving up the chance to sustain growth.\" American domination The Nobel economics prize - technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize - was created by the Swedish central bank \"in memory of Alfred Nobel\" and first awarded in 1969. That is unlike the other prizes which were created in the philanthropist's last will and testament, and first awarded in 1901. Last year, US economist Richard Thaler, author of the best seller Nudge, won for his work in behavioural economics. In 2016 it went to British-born American economist Oliver Hart and Finn Bengt Holmstrom for their work on \"contract theory\" - the study of how people develop legal agreements in situations with uncertain conditions. Since it was first awarded in 1969, Americans have dominated the awards. Only one woman has won the economics prize since 1969, Elinor Ostrom in 2009.", "summary": "Les américains William Nordhaus, 77 ans, et Paul Romer, 62 ans ont remporté le prix Nobel d'économie 2018 pour leurs travaux intégrant le changement climatique et l'innovation technologique dans l'analyse économique."}

The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital. The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims. But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is \"complete rubbish\" and biologically impossible. The conspiracy theories have been branded \"the worst kind of fake news\" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis. Conspiracy theory Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus. These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US. They appear to fall broadly in to two camps: Both these notions are \"complete rubbish,\" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. \"The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,\" Dr Clarke says. \"Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.\" While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect. \"Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.\" The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays. It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds. \"The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,\" he says. It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology. There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks? Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses. But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated. Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were \"concerning,\" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is \"absolutely no credible evidence for the link\". Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes. Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

Many of the participants using the hashtag have followed the pair by sharing images of themselves wearing make-up depicting blood, cuts and violence.

Alexandra Mitroshina came up with the idea for the campaign and organised the initial photo shoots. Her image on Instagram has had more than 420,000 \"likes\" and is among the most widely shared. Her own posting highlights the story of Olga Sadykova, reportedly killed by her husband on 8 July in the village of Kumysnoye.

There are reports of super-spreading during the new coronavirus outbreak, which has centred on Wuhan, in China. Briton Steve Walsh, who had been in Singapore, has been linked to four cases in the UK, five in France and possibly one in Majorca. Coronavirus claims 97 lives in one day Four more people diagnosed in UK How worried should we be? What it does to the body What is a super-spreader? It is a bit of a vague term, with no strict scientific definition. But it is when a patient infects significantly more people than usual. On average, each person infected with the new coronavirus is passing it on to between two and three other people. But this is only an average; some people will pass it on to nobody while others pass their infection on to far more. How big can a super-spreading event be? Massive - and they can have a huge effect on an outbreak. In 2015, a super-spreading event led to 82 people being infected from a single hospital patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), a coronavirus distantly related to the current virus And in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the vast majority of cases (61%) came from just a tiny handful of patients (3%). \"There were more than 100 new chains of transmission from just one funeral in June 2014,\" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, says. Why do some people spread more? Some just come into contact with far more people - either because of their job or where they live - and that means they can spread more of the disease, whether or not they themselves have symptoms. \"Kids are good at that - that's why closing schools can be a good measure,\" Dr John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says. \"Commercial sex workers were very important in spreading HIV,\" Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, says . Others are \"super-shedders\", who release unusually large amounts of virus (or other bug) from their bodies, so anybody coming into contact with them is more likely to become infected. Hospitals treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) became a major centre of super-spreading because the sickest patients were also the most infectious and they came into contact with lots of healthcare workers. How do they change an outbreak? \"It plays a big role at the beginning of any outbreak, when the virus is trying to get established,\" Dr Edmunds told BBC News. New infections, including the coronavirus, come from animals. When it makes the jump into the first patient, the disease might fizzle out before it can cause a large outbreak. But if it can quickly find its way into a super-spreader, then it gives the outbreak a boost. The same rules apply when cases are imported into other countries. \"If you have several super-spreaders in close proximity, you're going to struggle to contain your outbreak,\" Dr MacDermott says. What will it take to stop coronavirus if there is super-spreading? Super-spreading of the new coronavirus would not be a surprise and will not significantly change how the disease is managed. At the moment, we are completely reliant on identifying cases and anyone they have come into contact with quickly. \"It makes that even more important - you can't afford too many mistakes, you can't afford to miss the super-spreader,\" Prof Woolhouse says.

Historically, there has been a tendency to demonise the super-spreader. \"Typhoid Mary\", Irish cook Mary Mallon (1869-1938), unknowingly passed on typhoid fever when she had no symptoms and ended up spending decades in exile and forced quarantine. But in reality, it's not the patient's fault. \"We need to be careful of the language we use,\" Dr MacDermott says. \"They haven't done anything wrong, this is an infection picked up through no fault of their own. \"They're probably afraid and need love and attention.\"", "summary": "Dans presque chaque épidémie, on constate un phénomène de super-propagation - lorsqu'une personne transmet une infection à un grand nombre de personnes."}

Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and incendiary issue in Pakistan. Critics say blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities. Earlier this week Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif voiced his support for a wide-ranging crackdown on blasphemous content on social media. In a statement on his party's official Twitter account, he described blasphemy as an \"unpardonable offence\". 'Should share information' Then on Thursday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar reasserted Pakistan's determination to tackle the issue, saying he would take \"any steps necessary\" to make sure Pakistan's message got across. He said he had asked officials to liaise with the FBI in the US and with social media platforms on a daily basis. \"Facebook and other service providers should share all information about the people behind this blasphemous content with us,\" he is quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper. There has been little official description of what blasphemous content has been found online so far, but in the past blasphemy accusations have ranged from depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to critiques and inappropriate references to the Koran. But some critics say that this latest move is simply a way of cracking down on dissent. When five liberal bloggers and activists recently went missing, they were accused of blasphemy on social media. It is a very serious allegation in the deeply conservative nation, which can make those accused of it a target of public anger. Analysis - Tahir Imran, BBC Urdu social media editor In Pakistan there is a growing popular resentment to this so-called \"blasphemous content\" on social media, especially on Facebook. People are often openly accused of \"committing blasphemy on social media\". One top security agency has openly urged the masses to report anyone who is involved in posting such material online. Digital rights groups have expressed \"serious reservations\" and have called such steps \"playing with the lives of innocent people\". They have also criticised Facebook \"for colluding with authorities and censoring content infringing freedom of expression\". In a statement quoted by the AP news agency, Facebook said it viewed government requests with care keeping in mind \"the goal of protecting the privacy and rights of our users. \"We disclose information about accounts solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other formal request may be required for international requests, and we include these in our Government Requests Report.''

Self-defence As in previous operations in Gaza, Israel is likely to argue that its actions are justified under the right of self-defence. Enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the right of self-defence is a fundamental principle of international law. While aspects of this principle are disputed, it is universally agreed that a state can defend itself against an armed attack. There is some debate as to the intensity that an armed attack should reach before a state can lawfully resort to self-defence. Most international lawyers would agree that rockets launched against civilians that disrupt the social life of part of a country constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article 51. However, the facts underlying self-defence are often in dispute. Parties to a conflict seldom agree on who is the attacker and who is the defender - and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts are no exception. In this case, critics of the Israeli position also advance two legal arguments. First, they argue that the right of self-defence is available only against another state, but not against a non-state entity like Gaza. State practice, especially since the attacks of 11 September 2001, militates against this interpretation of self-defence, but the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice has not settled this question. Secondly, the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others, considers Gaza is still subject to Israeli occupation because of the degree to which Israel exerts control over and around that territory. Israel maintains that it has not occupied Gaza since its withdrawal in 2005 and that a territory cannot be occupied without \"boots on the ground\". The right of self-defence is no blank cheque. International law allows states to defend themselves in the right circumstances, but only with force that is necessary and proportionate. A common misperception is that proportionality in self-defence means an eye for an eye, a rocket for a rocket, or a casualty for a casualty. This is not so: there is no place in international law for using force in revenge. In some cases, a necessary and proportionate response will entail the use of greater military force than was involved in the original attack; in other cases, it will be possible for a country to defend itself effectively with less force. The law of armed conflict The principle of self-defence belongs to the body of international law that regulates resort to force or \"going to war\" (often referred to by the Latin term jus ad bellum, that is, \"law to war\"). A separate category of international law regulates the conduct of hostilities once the conflict has started. It is known as the law of armed conflict (or the jus in bello that is \"law in war\"). The law of armed conflict applies only to situations that can be classified as armed conflicts, with different sets of rules governing international or non-international armed conflicts. The law of armed conflict applies regardless of the reasons that prompted a party to resort to force. Starting a war off on the \"right\" side of the law does not give a state more rights in the conduct of hostilities than its enemies. It is possible for a state that resorted to force lawfully to commit unlawful acts in the course of an armed conflict - and vice versa. The law of armed conflict includes detailed rules on different aspects of the conduct of hostilities (protection of civilians, treatments of prisoners of war, occupied territory, etc). All of these rules rest on the balancing of four key principles: humanity and military necessity, and distinction and proportionality. Humanity and military necessity The principle of humanity requires belligerents to avoid unnecessary suffering and cruelty. The counterweight to it is military necessity. The legal manual used by the British armed forces says that military necessity allows a state to use force, unless otherwise prohibited, which is \"required in order to achieve the legitimate purpose of the conflict, namely the complete or partial submission of the enemy at the earliest possible moment and with the minimum expenditure of life and resources\". The argument that the Israeli bombardments on Gaza are ineffective because they have always failed to stop rocket attacks may, in one sense, evidence the futility of the use of force in this context. But, from a military necessity angle, it may justify the use of greater force as is necessary to achieve the objective of averting the attacks. Of course, the fact that the law permits a certain action does not make it wise in a political, moral or strategic sense. In any event, military necessity cannot justify actions that are prohibited under specific rules (e.g. those applying to the protection of civilians and the choice of permissible targets) or that, more generally, result \"in the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge\" (in the words of the Lieber Code, one of the first codifications of the rules of armed conflict enacted by President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War). Distinction and proportionality A cornerstone in the law of armed conflict is the principle of distinction: parties to a conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians at all times. Various specific rules flesh out the content of this principle. Attacks on civilians and civilian objects are always banned. Attacks may be conducted against combatants or non-combatants who directly participate in hostilities, and against military objectives. The principle of distinction also prohibits acts or threats of violence aimed at spreading terror among civilians, as well as attacks carried out with means which, by their nature, cannot target a specific military objective. The launching of missiles against southern Israel, for example, is said to breach distinction because of its inherently indiscriminate nature. But when does an object become a legitimate military target? International law defines military objectives as \"objects which... make an effective contribution to military action... and whose total or partial destruction... offers a definite military advantage\". Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tanks or Hamas rocket launchers are in this category. Problems arise with so-called dual-use targets, such as the Serbian TV station bombed by Nato during the 1999 Kosovo War. But the most difficult issues arise when a permissible military objective, such as a rocket launcher or an ammunition depot, lies in the proximity of civilians or civilian objects. Virtually every targeting decision in a densely populated area as Gaza will involve such situations. This is where the principle of proportionality also comes into play. While proportionality is an important concept in other areas of law, including human rights law, it has a distinctive meaning in the law of armed conflict. Whenever there is a risk of loss of civilian life or damage to civilian property, belligerents are required to balance the anticipated military advantage with the risks posed to civilians and their property. In some cases, this will mean - as the former president of the International Court of Justice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, wrote in a judgment - that \"even a legitimate target may not be attacked if the collateral civilian casualties would be disproportionate to the specific military gain from the attack\". An attacker is also under a duty to call off an attack immediately if, in the course of it, it realises that civilians would face excessive risk. Any attacker targeting military objectives in densely populated areas will have to do everything feasible to verify the nature of the targets and avoid errors. The practice of dropping leaflets or calling residents before a bombing is presented by Israel as evidence of its efforts to comply with these rules, although critics reply that these methods are not always effective at preventing loss of life and that, even when they are, they cannot avoid the destruction of civilian property as well as the infliction of suffering and distress on civilians. Conversely, a frequent accusation levelled against Hamas is that it deliberately endangers its own civilians by placing military objectives in their midst. If true, this would doubtless be a serious breach of the laws of armed conflict, but it does not mitigate Israel's obligation to continue to take all necessary precautions to minimise loss of civilian life. All modern armed forces, including the Israel Defense Forces, have specialists on the law of armed conflict who are involved in the approval of targets. The legality of a particular targeting decision will often depend on the facts. Was there a genuine military objective? Was it possible in the circumstances to hit that target while avoiding any loss of civilian life? What did the attacker know or should have known? Establishing these facts during an armed conflict, or in its aftermath, is no easy feat. However, when the attacker deliberately targets civilians or civilian objects, there is no version of the facts capable of justifying his actions under the laws of armed conflict. Human Rights The International Court of Justice has repeatedly ruled that the application of human rights law does not cease in times of war, while also maintaining that the law of armed conflict is the special law that governs this area as it was developed specifically to address the unique challenges of war. What this means in practice is not always clear, particularly as regards targeting decisions. When it comes to the clashes in Arab villages in Israel, there is, however, no concurrent application of the law of armed conflict: whether the response of Israel's law enforcement and security forces is consistent with international law in those cases will depend exclusively on the application of human rights law. East Jerusalem is a more complex situation because, while Israel annexed it to its territory, it is still considered part of the occupied Palestinian territory by virtually everyone else, including the International Court of Justice which gave an Advisory Opinion in 2004 on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in Occupied Palestinian Territory . Last, but certainly not least, it must be remembered that the law of armed conflict can only mitigate the horrors of war. A war fought with a scrupulous observance of all the rules in the book - if there ever was one - would still be a scourge.

Separately, the US said a Chinese researcher accused of hiding her ties to China's military was detained. China earlier ordered the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu. The move to shut down the diplomatic mission in the south-western city was in response to the US closing China's consulate in Houston. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was \"stealing\" intellectual property. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded by saying that the US move was based on \"a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies\". After a 72-hour deadline for Chinese diplomats to leave the Houston consulate expired on Friday at 16:00 (21:00 GMT) reporters saw men who appeared to be US officials force open a door to enter the premises. Uniformed staff from the US State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security took up position to guard the entrance. Tensions have been rising between the two nuclear powers over several key issues. President Donald Trump's administration has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, as well as China's imposition of a controversial new security law in Hong Kong. What is known about the Singaporean national? Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, on Friday pleaded guilty in a federal court to working as an illegal agent of the Chinese government in 2015-19, the US Department of Justice said in a statement. He was earlier charged with using his political consultancy in the country as a front to collect valuable, non-public information for Chinese intelligence. In his guilty plea, he admitted to scouting for Americans with high-level security clearance and getting them to write reports for fake clients. According to court documents he was recruited by Chinese intelligence in 2015 after giving a presentation in Beijing. At the time he was a PhD student at a prestigious Singaporean university. According to the guilty plea, Mr Yeo used a professional networking website - assumed to be LinkedIn - to contact potential targets likely to have access to sensitive information. Mr Yeo was arrested as he flew in to the US in 2019. And what about the arrested Chinese researcher? The researcher was named by US officials as Juan Tang, aged 37. She was among four Chinese nationals charged earlier this week with visa fraud for allegedly lying about serving in China's People's Liberation Army. Juan Tang was the last of the four to be detained in California, after the US had accused the Chinese consulate in San Francisco of harbouring her. It was not immediately clear how she was arrested. FBI agents have found pictures of Juan Tang dressed in military uniform and reviewed articles in China identifying her military affiliation, the Associated Press reports. It is quoting the University of California Davis as saying that she left her job as a visiting researcher in the Department of Radiation Oncology in June. Why is there tension between China and the US? There are a number of factors in play. US officials have blamed China for the global spread of Covid-19. More specifically, President Donald Trump has alleged, without presenting evidence, that the virus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. And, in unsubstantiated remarks, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said in March that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. The US and China have also been locked in a tariff war since 2018. Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft, but in Beijing there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. The US has also imposed sanctions on Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Beijing denies the allegations and has accused the US of \"gross interference\" in its domestic affairs. What about Hong Kong? China's imposition of a sweeping security law there is also a source of tension in relations with the US and the UK, which administered the territory until 1997. In response, the US last week revoked Hong Kong's special trading status, which allowed it to avoid tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US. The US and UK see the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK - before sovereignty reverted to Beijing. The UK has angered China by outlining a route to UK citizenship for nearly three million Hong Kong residents. China responded by threatening to stop recognising a type of British passport - BNO - held by many of those living in Hong Kong.", "summary": "Un homme de Singapour a plaidé coupable aux États-Unis d'avoir travaillé comme agent de la Chine, le dernier incident en date dans une impasse croissante entre Washington et Pékin."}

Soon after take-off - and just 450ft (137m) above the ground - the aircraft's nose began to pitch down. One pilot, according to the Wall Street Journal, said to the other \"pitch up, pitch up!\" before their radio died. The plane crashed only six minutes into its flight. 'Catastrophic failure' The Wall Street Journal - which says it has spoken to people close to the ongoing investigation - says the information it has \"paints a picture of a catastrophic failure that quickly overwhelmed the flight crew\". Leaks this week from the crash investigation in Ethiopia and in the US suggest an automatic anti-stall system was activated at the time of the disaster. The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) flight-control feature was also implicated in a fatal crash involving a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October. The Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. An investigation of the Lion Air flight suggested the anti-stall system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The Ethiopian authorities have already said there are \"clear similarities\" between the Lion Air incident and the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The airline and authorities have refused to comment on leaks from the investigation. Concerns about the Boeing 737 Max have led to a worldwide grounding of the plane. System update Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the two planes that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. The aircraft update is designed to ensure the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when a pilot tries to regain control. Boeing is also revising pilot training to provide \"enhanced understanding of the 737 MAX\" flight system and crew procedures. Earlier this week, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents, but a preliminary report from Ethiopian authorities is expected within days. Boeing has tried to restore its battered reputation, while continuing to insist the 737 Max is safe.", "summary": "C'est ce qui ressort des premières conclusions de l'analyse des boites noires de l'avion d'Ethiopian Airlines qui s'est écrasé la semaine dernière quelques minutes après son décollage."}

If convicted, he faces up to two years in jail and a fine. The Moroccan authorities have denied that the rapper's arrest was prompted by the song, saying it was based on a previous YouTube video in which he insults the police. But the arrest came two days after the song was released, prompting public suspicion that the two are directly linked. You may also be interested in: Khadija Anani of the Moroccan Human Rights Association thinks the arrest is \"an act of revenge that shows the decline in freedom of expression\" in the country. Amnesty International describes Gnawi's arrest as an \"outrageous assault on free speech\", and calls for him to be set free. 'Long Live the People' One aspect of the song Long Live the People that has attracted media attention is what Amnesty calls a \"derogatory reference to the king\", in particular the word \"n'ayyish\" - a disproving response to the traditional call of Long Live the King. Insulting the king is a criminal offence in Morocco, and a taboo subject in public. Even media critical of the monarchy like the Lakome website said the lyrics are \"harsh\" and \"crossed several red lines\". The song refers to social unrest since 2011, when the country experienced its own version of the Arab Spring, as well as protests in neighbouring Algeria that brought down the government earlier this year. The lyrics also mention \"the man from the Rif\" and \"the free man behind bars\", in what is widely seen as a reference to protests in Morocco's impoverished north and their leader Nasser Zefzafi, whose 20-year jail sentence last year prompted international condemnation. 'Unique impact' The video has gathered over 13 million views on YouTube, which comes close to the number of people who voted in the country's last election. \"We are faced with a political song the likes of which Morocco has never known in terms of clarity, directness, strength of message, and speed of spread,\" wrote the Al Youm 24 website. Since it was first posted on social media on 29 October, thousands of people have responded to the song - mostly in appreciation. \"That's it, everything is said in this video,\" one person wrote on Facebook. Another one gave a thumbs up to the song's defiant message in the face of \"the malice of the repressive regime\". One of the stronger comments warns officials who live in palaces that \"the revolution of the hungry will burn\" them. A message posted on Gnawi's behalf on Facebook to say he is in good health has received huge support - in the shape of sad and heart emojis, shares and comments calling for the rapper's release. Morocco adopted a set of new laws governing the media and freedom of expression in 2016, but the authorities are still accused of punishing critical journalists, bloggers and members of the public who focus on the king, religion or the state.

He led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to them. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. 'Humanity and love' Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness. Following Mr Gassama's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mali's ambassador in France, Toumani Djimé Diallo, said: ''The courage of our young compatriot aged 22, an undocumented migrant, shows that his values are of humanity and love for his neighbour. \"These are fundamental values in Malian society and are Republican values shared by France.'' Mr Gassama, who is understood to have been in France for only six months, is among thousands of Malians still making the journey to Europe, despite much-publicised measures to limit immigration to the continent. This is not only because of the failure, so far, of European Union attempts to stop people from crossing the Sahara and Mediterranean. It is also because many of those of who leave Mali - including Mr Gassama, as his surname indicates - are from the Soninke ethnic group. Large-scale expulsions For Soninko (the plural of Soninke), travelling has for centuries been an obligatory rite of passage to manhood. So well established is the Malian travelling tradition - and so strong are the emigrants' links with home - that when Mali's population is stated to be 12 million, the figure includes a diaspora estimated at about three million people. The Ministry for Overseas Malians says that remittances from the diaspora - estimated at more than $3bn (£2.25bn) per year - easily provide a third of the country's GDP. But it is important to keep perspective on African emigration. Most sub-Saharan Africans who travel to seek work do so within the African continent - and because of Mali's strong emigration tradition, its statistics are a useful indicator of the broader picture. Data collected by the ministry shows that of 89,134 Malians repatriated by force or voluntarily between 2002 and 2013, more than 90% (81,755) were sent back by other African countries - in particular, Ivory Coast, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. As a matter of comparison, in the same period, European countries expelled 5,947 Malians. More recently, there have been large-scale expulsions of Malians from the Central African Republic, Angola and Gabon. Storming fences Many African countries have well-established Malian - chiefly Soninke - communities which are engaged in trade. As a consequence, a Malian who travels - be it to Nouakchott or New York - has friends and solidarity wherever he or she goes. For the Malians who do travel to Europe there are two options. Those who have a relative in the EU - most often in France or Spain - might seek an invitation and a tourist visa, secured legally but on which they might decide to overstay. For them, the preferred means of travel is by air. For the past 30 years, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa without passports or visas have used four main routes to cross by boat to Europe. The busiest, until 2012, was to the Canary Islands which belong to Spain. But this exit point was blocked after Spain's Gardia Civil, or law enforcement agency, was stationed in Mauritania. They are still there. Ceuta and Melilla are two Spanish enclaves on the northern Mediterranean shore of Morocco. In recent years, there have been occasional, spectacular storming by migrants of the fences around the enclaves. Moroccan co-operation with the EU has largely closed this route. Malta and southern Italy (Lampedusa) are reached by boat from Algeria and Tunisia. But this route is less in favour at the moment as it requires travelling through Algeria - which has sent back 27,000 migrants since 2015 and is regularly criticised by human rights groups for treating them in a degrading way. Also, Algeria is reached after a six-day truck journey through the desert of northern Mali, where landmines and other explosive devices are a threat. Empire crushed The favoured route across the desert has moved eastwards. As a result of anti-migration moves by the EU in Mauritania and Morocco, the insecurity in northern Mali and the instability in Libya, the favoured exit point from the south into the desert is now Niger. This is where the EU is currently concentrating its efforts to reduce emigration. About 7,000 African travellers were made to turn back in Niger last year, up from 1,400 in 2014. More than 2,000 returns in the first three months of 2018 suggest another record year. European policymakers argue that the best way to reduce immigration pressure from Africa is for rich countries to help create economic opportunities in countries like Mali for the continent's young population. This is partly true. But Soninke men - like the 22-year-old Mr Gassama - will continue to travel. It has been like that ever since the Ouagadou Empire, which was built on the wealth from gold and salt exports, was crushed by Soundiata Keita's Mali Empire 700 years ago. When things got tough for the Soninkes, fathers began to encourage their sons to travel away in the lean season, instructing them to return only once they had enough money to get married and establish a family. So the EU will not find it easy to reverse a tradition that dates back to the year 1240 or thereabouts. Knowing that Soninkes will always be on the move, the best option would be for other, emerging African countries - perhaps with the help of European investment - to speed up their development and accommodate energetic and fearless Malians like Mr Gassama.

There are no plans at present for Mr Trudeau to be tested for coronavirus. \"The prime minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow [Friday],\" his office said. There are currently approximately 103 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Canada. Meetings postponed Ms Grégoire Trudeau began to show mild flu-like symptoms including a low fever late on Wednesday night after returning from the UK. Among other engagements she had been at a charity event attended by 12,000 people at Wembley Arena for WE day, an annual series of youth empowerment events. She shared a stage with former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and singer Leona Lewis. Other guests at the event included celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, actor Idris Elba and Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton. After she tested positive for Covid-19, Ms Grégoire Trudeau said: \"Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. \"We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously.\" Health workers will contact people whom Mrs Grégoire Trudeau has recently met. However, those who have been in contact with the prime minister are deemed not to be at risk, as Mr Trudeau has shown no symptoms. A number of politicians around the globe have been self-isolating in recent days after coming into possible contact with the virus, including five senior US Republicans and a Canadian cabinet minister. Mr Trudeau was scheduled to hold meetings over the next two days in Ottawa with provincial premiers and First Nations leaders. Those meetings have been postponed. Mr Trudeau will now be speaking with those provincial counterparts over the phone, with the topic focusing on Canada's response to the pandemic, said the prime minister's office in a statement. Another federal party leader, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, said on Thursday he was also staying at home because he was feeling unwell, though doctors have told him that his symptoms are not consistent with the coronavirus. \"Their advice is for me to limit contact with the public until I am feeling better,\" he said on Twitter. What is the situation in Canada? There are currently approximately 103 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Canada, in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Quebec, and Manitoba. There has been one death linked to the disease. Canada announced on Wednesday a C$1bn ($728m; £562m) coronavirus response fund to deal with the pandemic. The funding package will help the country address the domestic impact of the virus and to support further research, including vaccine development. Mr Trudeau said his government was ready to do more if the situation warranted. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the prime minister urged Canadians to follow the recommendations of public health officials in order to help slow the spread of the disease and to avoid overburdening the health care system.", "summary": "Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, l'épouse du Premier ministre canadien Justin Trudeau, a été testée positive au coronavirus à son retour d'un voyage à Londres, selon un communiqué du bureau du Premier ministre."}

About 1,800 teenagers in his local district have now used the app. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai described him as \"an inspiration\". \"He's calling on young people all over the world to stop cyberbullying and to help peers in their community who suffer from mental and emotional violence. Sadat is a true changemaker,\" she said in an online speech. The International Children's Peace Prize is an annual award that recognises the work of young people who promote children's rights. Previous winners include Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Mr Rahman's app, Cyber Teens, allows young people to report cyberbullying confidentially through a network of volunteers who then approach police or social workers, while also educating teenagers about online safety. Since its launch, more than 300 young victims of online crimes have been supported and eight people - including adults who sexually harassed children online - have been arrested. The teenager plans to use the €100,000 (£90,000, $118,000) award to spread the app further in his home country \"and hopefully to serve as a model for the rest of the world\", according to the AFP news agency. Accepting the award, Rahman explained that half of young internet users in Bangladesh had experienced cyberbullying and that fear and lack of knowledge had previously prevented many of them from reporting crimes. \"I strongly believe awareness, empathy, counselling and action are the four drivers of force to combat cyberbullying,\" he said. \"The fight against cyberbullying is like a war, and in this war, I'm a warrior.

Both have supported the boycott movement against Israel, but Israeli law allows supporters of the campaign to be banned from visiting. President Trump earlier tweeted it would show \"great weakness\" if the pair were allowed entry. Ms Omar described Israel's move as \"an insult to democratic values and a chilling response to a visit by government officials from an allied nation\". Mr Trump earlier had taken to Twitter to urge that the two lawmakers be blocked from visiting, adding that \"they hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds\". Ms Omar and Ms Tlaib have both been criticised for their stance on Israel - but have denied charges of being anti-Semitic. Speaking to reporters later on Thursday, Mr Trump said, \"I can't imagine why Israel would let them in.\" Why have they been banned? Israeli law blocks entrance visas to any foreigner who calls for any type of boycott that targets Israel - either economic, cultural or academic. The law attempts to suppress the \"boycott, divest, sanction\" movement, which has drawn growing support across Europe and the US. Israeli officials had earlier said they would make an exception for the elected US officials, before backtracking. According to US media, their trip was meant to begin on Sunday, and would include a stop at one of the most sensitive sites in the region - a hilltop plateau in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. They also planned to visit Israeli and Palestinian peace activists and travel to Jerusalem and the West Bank cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Hebron. The trip to the West Bank was planned by Miftah, an organisation headed by Palestinian peace negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. Ms Tlaib was planning to stay for two extra days to visit her grandmother, who lives in a Palestinian village. Who are they? President Trump, who has a close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has frequently feuded with the lawmakers and in remarks widely condemned as racist, told them to \"go back\" to the countries that their families were from. Ms Tlaib - the first member of the US Congress of Palestinian descent - was born in Michigan, and Ms Omar is from Minnesota but was born in Somalia. After the Democratic-led House of Representatives voted against the boycott against Israel movement in July, Ms Tlaib criticised the country as \"racist\". \"I can't stand by and watch this attack on our freedom of speech and the right to boycott the racist policies of the government and the state of Israel,\" she said. The House also voted to condemn hate speech in a move directed at Ms Omar for her criticism of US support for Israel. \"It's all about the Benjamins baby,\" Ms Omar had tweeted in a reference to the US $100 note, leading to allegations that she was using a negative stereotype for Jews. She later apologised, and said the tweet was meant to criticise lobbyists, not Jews. She also thanked \"Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes\". Written in every US passport is a message to \"all whom it may concern\" that the bearer of the document be allowed to pass \"without delay or hindrance\". In the case of Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, however, hindrance is exactly what Donald Trump wanted. An American president urging another nation to deny entry to US citizens, let alone members of Congress, is unusual in the extreme. Viewed in the context of Mr Trump's ongoing feud with these congresswomen, however, it makes perfect sense. The lines between foreign and domestic policy, between the public actions and personal grievances, have always been blurry with this president. At the very least, by tweeting before Israel acted, the president boosted his power at the expense of the Israelis, who were left seeming as though they bent to his will. There's also plenty of reason for members of Congress to be uncomfortable with the president's actions. While the White House insists Mr Trump was not encouraging a foreign nation to punish American politicians for their political viewpoints, there is concern that this could limit the access of future congressional delegations to nations they have criticised in the past. What has Israel said? A statement from the Israeli interior ministry confirming the ban said it was \"inconceivable that those who wish to harm the state of Israel while visiting would be granted entry\". But only last month Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer said the two Democrats would be permitted to visit \"out of respect for the US Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America\". In a statement on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu said \"there is no country in the world that respects the US and the American Congress more than Israel.\" \"However, the itinerary showed that the congresswomen's sole intention was to harm Israel.\" What's the reaction? The US ambassador to Israel said in a statement that the US \"supports and respects the decision of the Government of Israel to deny entry\". Israel \"has every right to protect its borders against those activists in the same manner as it would bar entrants with more conventional weapons,\" wrote Ambassador David Friedman. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), said in a tweet while they disagree with the lawmakers' support for the boycott movement against Israel, they also believe \"every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand\". It was a sentiment echoed by Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who said that while he disagreed with the women, \"denying them entry into Israel is a mistake. Being blocked is what they really hoped for all along in order to bolster their attacks against the Jewish state.\" New Jersey Democrat Congressman Tom Malinowski called the decision \"disrespectful to Congress\" and said during a cross-party congressional trip to Israel last week officials had assured them their colleagues would be allowed to visit. \"First he tells Congresswoman Tlaib to 'go back' to 'her' country, and then he tells that country not to let her in,\" he tweeted, referring to Mr Trump's comments. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said \"this sad reversal is deeply disappointing\". She called Israel's denial \"a sign of weakness\" and said President Trump's comments \"a sign of ignorance and disrespect\". Has this happened before? The ban on two foreign dignitaries is rare but not unprecedented. Makarim Wibisono, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, was denied entry in 2015 after Israel said his mandate was anti-Israel. Fouad Ahmad Assadi of Spain's Socialist Party, was barred from entering Israel last month because he was deemed a threat to national security. The Lebanese-born politician travelled there to participate in the annual Socialist International conference in Tel Aviv and Ramallah - but he was denied entry at Ben Gurion Airport. However, no members of US Congress have been blocked before now. Israel often hosts congressional delegations. Earlier this month, 41 Democrats and 31 Republicans attended a visit sponsored by the AIPAC lobby group.", "summary": "Israël bloque la visite de deux législateurs démocrates américains critiques à l'égard d'Israël."}

And it warns that nature is being destroyed by humans at a rate never seen before. Wildlife is \"in freefall\" as we burn forests, over-fish our seas and destroy wild areas, says Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF. \"We are wrecking our world - the one place we call home - risking our health, security and survival here on Earth. Now nature is sending us a desperate SOS and time is running out.\" What do the numbers mean? The report looked at thousands of different wildlife species monitored by conservation scientists in habitats across the world. They recorded an average 68% fall in more than 20,000 populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish since 1970. The decline was clear evidence of the damage human activity is doing to the natural world, said Dr Andrew Terry, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which provides the data. \"If nothing changes, populations will undoubtedly continue to fall, driving wildlife to extinction and threatening the integrity of the ecosystems on which we depend,\" he added. The report says the Covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of how nature and humans are intertwined. Factors believed to lead to the emergence of pandemics - including habitat loss and the use and trade of wildlife - are also some of the drivers behind the decline in wildlife. New modelling evidence suggests we can halt and even reverse habitat loss and deforestation if we take urgent conservation action and change the way we produce and consume food. The British TV presenter and naturalist Sir David Attenborough said the Anthropocene, the geological age during which human activity has come to the fore, could be the moment we achieve a balance with the natural world and become stewards of our planet. \"Doing so will require systemic shifts in how we produce food, create energy, manage our oceans and use materials,\" he said. \"But above all it will require a change in perspective. A change from viewing nature as something that's optional or 'nice to have' to the single greatest ally we have in restoring balance to our world.\" Sir David presents a new documentary on extinction to be aired on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. How do we measure the loss of nature? Measuring the variety of all life on Earth is complex, with a number of different measures. Taken together, they provide evidence that biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history. This particular report uses an index of whether populations of wildlife are going up or down. It does not tell us the number of species lost, or extinctions. The largest declines are in tropical areas. The drop of 94% for Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest anywhere in the world, driven by a cocktail of threats to reptiles, amphibians and birds. \"This report is looking at the global picture and the need to act soon in order to start reversing these trends,\" said Louise McRae of ZSL. The data has been used for modelling work to look at what might be needed to reverse the decline. Research published in the journal Nature suggests that to turn the tide we must transform the way we produce and consume food, including reducing food waste and eating food with a lower environmental impact. Prof Dame Georgina Mace of UCL said conservation actions alone wouldn't be sufficient to \"bend the curve on biodiversity loss\". \"It will require actions from other sectors, and here we show that the food system will be particularly important, both from the agricultural sector on the supply side, and consumers on the demand side,\" she said. What do other measures tell us about the loss of nature? Extinction data is compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has evaluated more than 100,000 species of plants and animals, with more than 32,000 species threatened with extinction. In 2019, an intergovernmental panel of scientists concluded that one million species (500,000 animals and plants, and 500,000 insects) are threatened with extinction, some within decades. The WWF report is one of many assessments of the state of nature being published in the coming weeks and months in the build-up to a major summit next year. The UN will reveal next Tuesday its latest assessment of the state of nature worldwide.

Meghan spoke with Oprah for most of the interview, before being joined by Prince Harry. 1. 'Discussions about how dark Meghan's baby might be' One of the biggest allegations from the interview was that there were \"several conversations\" within the Royal Family about how dark Meghan and Harry's baby might be. \"In those months when I was pregnant [there were] concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,\" said Meghan. She said the conversations were with Harry, who relayed them to her. Both she and Harry refused to say which royal said it. \"That conversation, I am never going to share,\" said Harry. \"At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.\" Harry also said that it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles. 2. Kate 'made Meghan cry' - not the other way around One story that circulated in the newspapers a few years ago was that the Duchess of Cambridge was left in tears by Meghan in the run-up to the wedding in a row over flower girl dresses. But Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true. \"A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,\" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. \"I'm not sharing that piece about Kate to be disparaging about her,\" Meghan said. She said Kate was \"a good person\" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected. 3. Meghan said she was on the verge of suicide but was refused help Meghan spoke about how lonely she felt after joining the Royal Family and the loss of her freedom. \"When I joined that family, that was the last time until we came here that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys, all that gets turned over,\" she said. She said her mental health got so bad that she \"didn't want to be alive any more\". \"I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, said I had never felt that way before and need to go somewhere, and I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution.\" She said she went to \"one of the most senior people\" within the institution and then to the palace human resources department. \"Nothing was ever done,\" she added. 4. Meghan spoke to one of Diana's friends Princess Diana's name came up many times throughout the interview - with similarities drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family. \"I didn't even know who to turn to,\" said Meghan, of the time when she was struggling. \"One of the people I reached out to who's continued to be a friend and confidante was one of my husband's mom's best friends. \"Because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?\" 5. Harry feels 'let down' by Charles Oprah asked Harry about his relationships with his family and especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother, the Duke of Cambridge. At one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\". \"I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson. \"But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship.\" On William, Harry said he loved him to bits and they have been through hell together. \"But we were on different paths.\" 6. But the couple's relationship with the Queen is good Harry said he has a \"really good\" relationship with his grandmother and he has spoken to her more in the past year - including video calls with Archie - than he has for many years. \"She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be.\" Meghan also praised the Queen and said she gave her some beautiful jewellery for the couple's first joint engagement together as well as sharing a blanket with her to keep warm while travelling together. 7. Harry 'cut off financially' In the first quarter of 2020, Harry said his family \"literally cut me off financially\". He said the Netflix and Spotify deals that he and Meghan have struck to make shows and podcasts were never part of the plan but \"I had to afford security for us\". \"But I've got what my mum left me and without that we wouldn't have been able to do this.\" The couple reveal that, after they were cut off, American billionaire and media mogul Tyler Perry provided Harry and Meghan with a home and security last year when they moved from Canada to southern California. 8. The truth behind a photograph Meghan said that the evening after she told Harry that she was feeling suicidal, they had to attend an official event at the Royal Albert Hall. Meghan spoke about a photo that has haunted her because of what it reminded her of. She said a friend had commented how great the couple looked but she added: \"That picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine,\" she told Oprah, as she became emotional. \"We are smiling and doing our job but we're both just trying to hold on. \"Every time those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping.\" 9. Meghan 'didn't do any research' on the Royal Family Talking about the first time she met the Queen, Meghan said she was surprised to learn she had to curtsy. She said she thought it was just \"part of the fanfare\" and didn't happen inside the Royal Family She described having to quickly practise curtsying before an impromptu lunch with the Queen. \"I said: 'It's your grandmother,\" said Meghan. \"He said: 'It's the Queen.'\" Meghan added that she hadn't done any research on the family before joining - and insisted she had never looked up her husband online while they were dating. 10. They exchanged vows three days before their wedding Millions of people watched Harry and Meghan tie the knot at Windsor Castle in 2018. That ceremony was when they were legally married - but the couple revealed they also exchanged vows in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days before. Meghan said: \"We called the archbishop and we just said, 'look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between us... just the two of us in our backyard'.\" 11. Archie's favourite phrase is 'drive safe' Harry spoke about Archie, and the joy he gets from taking him out on bike rides. The interview included a clip of the toddler playing on the beach with his parents. The couple joked that his favourite word for the past few weeks has been \"hydrate\", and Harry said whenever anyone leaves the house, Archie tells them \"drive safe\". 12. And... it's a girl The couple confirm they're expecting a baby girl in the summer. Harry said it was \"amazing\", adding: \"What more can you ask for?\" - but said they would be done after baby number two arrives. Towards the end of the interview, Oprah asked if Meghan had got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. \"Greater than any fairytale that you've ever read,\" she said.", "summary": "L'interview très attendue du Duc et de la Duchesse du Sussex avec Oprah Winfrey a été diffusée aux États-Unis - le couple y partage sa version de la vie dans la famille royale."}

The Chinese vaccine is one of two that the Brazilian government has lined up. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by Covid-19. Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. Several countries, including Indonesia, Turkey and Singapore, have placed orders for the vaccine. Last week researchers at the Butantan Institute, which has been conducting the trials in Brazil, announced that the vaccine had a 78% efficacy against \"mild-to-severe\" Covid-19 cases. But on Tuesday they revealed that calculations for this figure did not include data from a group of \"very mild infections\" among those who received the vaccine that did not require clinical assistance. With the inclusion of this data, the efficacy rate is now 50.4%, said researchers. But Butantan stressed that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases. The Sinovac trials have yielded different results across different countries. Last month Turkish researchers said the Sinovac vaccine was 91.25% effective, while Indonesia, which rolled out its mass vaccination programme on Wednesday, said it was 65.3% effective. Both were interim results from late-stage trials. Can vaccines be compared? By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health reporter The latest figures for China's coronavirus vaccine show just how difficult it is to compare vaccines. On the face of it, the 50% effectiveness figure isn't as good as Oxford's 70% or Pfizer and Moderna's 95%. But trials are run very differently in different countries - the numbers of volunteers enrolled varies wildly, as do the criteria used to test how much protection the vaccines offer. A figure for efficacy is reached by looking at how many people developed Covid after being given the vaccine, compared with how many were affected when given a dummy injection. Normally, that is based on people developing obvious symptoms but in this Brazilian trial, people with no symptoms also appear to have been included. So it's only when the full data from all trials of this vaccine are published that scientists can analyse its real efficacy, and compare like with like. Only limited data for this Sinovac vaccine is currently available - and experts say that is confusing the picture. In the long term, many vaccines against Covid are needed to vaccinate the world and, inevitably, some will perform better than others - but giving as many people as possible some protection is the priority. There has been concern and criticism that Chinese vaccine trials are not subject to the same scrutiny and levels of transparency as its Western counterparts. Both the Sinovac vaccine and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca have requests for emergency use authorisation pending with regulators in Brazil. The latest news comes as Brazil is dealing with a major spike in cases. The country currently has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world at over 8.1 million, just behind the US and India. The BBC World Service's Americas editor Candace Piette says the country is suffering one of the world's deadliest outbreaks but as yet, has not announced when its vaccination programme will begin. The delay has been caused in large part by the government's haphazard and divided approach to vaccination, says our correspondent.", "summary": "Un vaccin contre le coronavirus développé par la firme chinoise Sinovac s'est révélé efficace à 50,4% lors d'essais cliniques au Brésil, selon les derniers résultats publiés par les chercheurs."}

Professor Debbie Bradshaw, one of the authors, said it revealed a \"huge discrepancy\" in the numbers. On Thursday the country said there had been a record 572 deaths in the last 24 hours. South Africa currently has the fifth highest number of confirmed cases worldwide with more than 400,000 infections and a death toll of 5,940. This is a far lower death toll than in other countries that have fewer confirmed cases, for example the UK. In a televised address on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered the closure of public schools for four weeks amid the sharply rising case numbers. What does the report say? SAMRC released the Report on Weekly Deaths in South Africa late on Wednesday. It shows that between 6 May and 14 July this year there were 17,090 excess natural deaths - far higher than in past years and higher than researchers had forecasted. That number suggests there have been 11,000 unexplained deaths. Prof Bradshaw said these reports \"have revealed a huge discrepancy between the country's confirmed Covid-19 deaths and number of excess natural deaths\". Early on in the pandemic, South Africa recorded 9% fewer deaths on average compared to previous years, which has been attributed to a ban on alcohol and the national lockdown. It is not clear if the higher number of deaths being recorded more recently is purely down to the pandemic, but researchers think this could be a factor. There are also concerns people are dying because they are staying away from hospitals, for fear of becoming infected or because of a lack of space. SAMRC President Prof Glenda Gray said the rise \"may be attributed to both Covid-19 deaths as well non-Covid-19 due to other diseases such as TB, HIV and non-communicable diseases, as health services are re-orientated to support this health crisis\". On Thursday, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told parliament by video link that the SAMRC figures were \"comparable to countries like India and Russia, but significantly lower than the UK or Spain.\" How has South Africa been handling the pandemic? South Africa is the worst affected nation on the continent. President Ramaphosa imposed a strict lockdown in the country at the end of March, even banning the sale of cigarettes and alcohol in a bid to ease pressure on health workers. The restrictions were enforced by soldiers on the streets in a bid to bring the outbreak under control. Authorities later lifted the alcohol ban as business reopened and people returned to work. But infection numbers have soared in recent weeks. President Ramaphosa reintroduced the alcohol ban in July as the country grappled with a chronic shortage of hospital beds and state hospitals - on which 80% of the population depend - faced unprecedented strain. Confirmed cases are now rising by more than 10,000 a day. What about other African countries? Overall, there are now more than 770,000 confirmed cases throughout Africa.

Robots are already working in some hospitals but are mostly confined to menial tasks such as shifting supplies or patient records. You can also have a chat with a digital helper like Alexa or Siri, but such conversations are typically simple, short and one-on-one. SPRING will develop new robots which can deal with multiple people in social situations. 'Who can I help?' Prof Lemon says they will be able to detect that there are several people in a room and ask itself: \"Is this person anxious, has this person been waiting for a long time? \"Are these people actually talking to each other and I don't need to bother them? Who can I help?\" It will be able to manage the conversation by recognising that the people have different roles - parent, carer, doctor, nurse. The drive to create what are called socially assistive robots (SARs) is the first project to be announced by the National Robotarium. It is a partnership between Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh that aims to create a world-leading centre for robotics and AI. Its new building is due to open on the Heriot-Watt campus in 2021. SPRING involves eight research institutions in Europe and Asia. It will develop new research into conversational AI, computer vision, machine learning and human-robot interaction, alongside human behaviour analysis and sensorimotor robot control. The work builds on the success of Heriot-Watt's Amazon Alexa Prize winning conversational AI system called Alana. A new spinout company called Alana AI is about to be launched to focus on the next generation of conversational user interfaces. Prof Lemon says research shows conversational robots can be good for your health, decreasing stress and loneliness and improving mood and sociability. \"Social robot technology is of interest for elder care because robot companionship has the long-term potential to better connect people with each other,\" he says. \"Social robots could improve both psychological well-being and the relationship between patients and hospital professionals.\" The National Robotarium's other key research areas include power systems, manufacturing, assisted living, agriculture technology and hazardous environments. There is but one drawback, SPRING is a four-year project. We can but hope the current pandemic has subsided long before then.

The girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was \"a Herculean achievement\". Their head teacher said the girls had made friends and were \"laughing a lot\". The girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid. However, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development. \"When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,\" he said. \"From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'.\" Mr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum. In March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain. In 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved. Since then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible. The girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. 'Different characters' She said: \"Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters. \"They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child.\" For the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits. In October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Dr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks. She said: \"The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis. \"One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls.\" She said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness. 'Finding that balance' At children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. A special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs. Physiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them. \"It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,\" she said. \"To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. \"Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them.\" Watching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father. \"They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,\" he said. \"All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be.\" Mr Ndiaye said his hopes were \"parallel to my fears\" as the girls had \"so many times come close to the worst\". \"But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,\" he said. \"The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away. \"They are my warriors. They have proved they will never surrender without fighting.

The Jordanian-born and British-educated Princess Haya, 45, married Sheikh Mohammed - owner of Godolphin horse racing stables - in 2004, becoming his sixth and \"junior wife\". Sheikh Mohammed reportedly has 23 children by different wives. Princess Haya fled initially this year to Germany to seek asylum. She is now said to be living in a £85m ($107m) town house in Kensington Palace Gardens, in central London, and preparing for a legal battle in the High Court. So what prompted her to flee her luxurious life in Dubai and why is she said to be \"afraid for her life\"? Sources close to her have said that Princess Haya had recently discovered disturbing facts behind the mysterious return to Dubai last year of Sheikha Latifa, one of the ruler's daughters. She fled the UAE by sea with the help of a Frenchman but was intercepted by armed men off the coast of India and returned to Dubai. Princess Haya then, along with the former Irish president Mary Robinson, defended Dubai's reputation over the incident. The Dubai authorities said the runaway Sheikha Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe in Dubai\". But human rights advocates said she was forcibly abducted against her will. Since then, it is alleged, Princess Haya has learnt new facts about the case and consequently came under increasing hostility and pressure from members of her husband's extended family until she no longer felt safe there. A source close to her said she fears she may now be abducted herself and \"rendered\" back to Dubai. The UAE embassy in London has declined to comment on what it says is a personal matter between two individuals. There is, however, a wider, international element to this story. Princess Haya, who was educated at Bryanston School in Dorset then University of Oxford, is thought likely to want to stay in the UK. If her estranged husband demands her return then this poses a diplomatic headache for Britain, which has close ties to the UAE. The case is also awkward for Jordan since Princess Haya is the half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah. Nearly a quarter of a million Jordanians work in the UAE, sending back remittances, and Jordan cannot afford a rift with Dubai.

Officials from Sudan's antiquities and museums department said when they visited the site, some 270km (170 miles) north of the capital Khartoum, last month they found two mechanical diggers and five men at work. They had excavated a vast trench about 17 metres (55 feet) deep, and 20 metres long. \"They had only one goal in digging here - to find gold... they did something crazy; to save time, they used heavy machinery,\" a shocked archaeologist Habab Idriss Ahmed, who has worked at the historic location since 1999, told the AFP news agency. Sudan is home to hundreds of pyramids and other ancient sites, although they are not as well known as those in its northern neighbour, Egypt. Sudan's archaeologists warned that the destruction was not unique but part of a growing problem. At Sai, a 12km-long river island in the Nile, hundreds of graves, some dating back to the times of the pharaohs, have been raided and destroyed by looters. \"Out of a thousand more or less well-known sites in Sudan, at least a hundred have been destroyed or damaged,\" said Hatem al-Nour, Sudan's director of antiquities and museums. He added that the lack of security at the sites made them easy targets for looters. Sudan is Africa's third largest producer of gold, after South Africa and Ghana, with commercial mining bringing in $1.2bn (£900m) to the government last year, AFP reports. But illegal mining is said to be encouraged by some local authorities and businessmen who give machines to treasure hunters. Enforcement of laws is also not stringent - the diggers who destroyed the Jabal Maragha, were freed without charge. It is not clear why. \"They should have been put in jail and their machines confiscated. There are laws,\" said Mahmoud al-Tayeb, a former expert from Sudan's antiquities department. One of the long-term strategies to protect the historical sites is to teach young people about Sudanese history, so that they can cherish their heritage, Prof Habbab Idris Muhammad, the chief inspector at the antiquities and museums department told the Suna news agency.

The records reveal \"chronic losses and years of tax avoidance\", it says. Mr Trump called the report \"fake news\". \"Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,\" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. \"The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me well… they treat me very badly,\" he said. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was \"provided by sources with legal access to it\". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. What are the key claims? The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, \"largely because he reported losing much more money than he made\". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS \"portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes\". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics, the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\". \"Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,\" he said. By using the term \"personal taxes\", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. What else does the report say? The newspaper also claims that \"most\" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - \"report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year\". \"That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,\" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from \"lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour\" from the president. The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money \"from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics\". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to \"carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years\". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story \"goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman\". \"You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,\" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: \"That makes me smart.\" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. What has the reaction been? Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken \"extraordinary measures\" to \"game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes\". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. Unwanted distraction for Trump or more? So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.", "summary": "Selon le New York Times, Donald Trump n'a payé que 750 dollars (environ 422.000 FCFA) d'impôt fédéral sur le revenu en 2016, l'année où il s'est présenté à la présidence des États-Unis, et au cours de sa première année à la Maison Blanche."}

US President Donald Trump has been leading a public campaign urging American allies to cut ties with Huawei, saying the company's technology, among other things, was a security risk because it allowed the Chinese government to spy. The company has repeatedly denied the claims. The US campaign could spark what Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO, predicted would be the inevitable bifurcation of the internet, between a \"Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America\". If this happens, Africa should not take sides, Harriet Kariuki, a Sino-African relations specialist, told the BBC. \"It's not our battle, we should instead focus on what works for us,\" she said. African countries should instead come together to educate people about what is at stake, and hopefully agree on an EU-type data protection law to protect African consumers, Ms Kariuki said. \"This is probably the time Africa considers developing its own technologies relevant to its market instead of being passive consumers. I want to see African countries come together and push back against this creeping digital colonisation,\" she told the BBC. 'The African Union hack' While the recent concern about Huawei has been focused on communications networks in the West, there are also allegations of a previous security breach in Africa. Critics of Huawei operations point to a report in January 2018 in French newspaper Le Monde that found that the computer system at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, most of which was installed by Huawei, had allegedly been compromised. The discovery found that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU's servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. The allegations were denied by the African Union and Chinese officials. African governments, even those with close security relationships with the US, have mostly sat out of the debate about Huawei - and the reasons are obvious. Huawei runs a vast operation in Africa including being a major seller of smartphones. It has built most of Africa's 4G internet network, Cobus van Staden, a Senior China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told the BBC. The CEO of Kenya's telecom giant Safaricom Bob Collymore said Huawei had been a \"great partner for many years\". \"We would like to stick with our partners as much as we can, however there can be some practical difficulties if the embargo is on American companies working with Huawei because it is an interconnected business,\" he said in a recent speech. About Huawei in Africa: Sources: Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Huawei, IDC The company, which opened its first office in Africa in 1998, is also in pole position to win contracts to roll out 5G network on the continent. The super-fast network is touted as the internet iteration that will power \"Internet of Things\" technologies, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and more. \"The scaling of Huawei's presence on the continent has been made possible by being the first company to exploit the potential of the IT economy in Africa, and having the wherewithal to support its projects,\" Mr Van Staden said. \"China's tied-aid conditions that requires African governments to work with Chinese companies, has also helped it,\" he added. You may also be interested in: According to technology research firm IDC, Huawei is currently the fourth biggest smartphone seller in Africa, behind another Chinese company, Transsion, which makes the Tecno and Infinix brands, and Samsung. All four brands currently use Google's Android operating system. Huawei's dominance and its relationship with governments in Africa could come in handy if the so-called tech cold war between China and the US threatens its African operations. \"Africa is the last tech market in the world and dominance in it would be key,\" Mr Van Staden said. \"Some people, like here in South Africa, where Huawei is a major player, are worried about being locked out of the Google ecosystem but Huawei could use the current situation to change the game\". \"Few US companies know how to work in the African market, to make relevant products for consumers on the continent. Huawei, could use the current situation to change the calculus and develop softwares in languages that truly serves the African market,\" Mr van Staden said. Most Africans are online today thanks to cheap Chinese phones and many are more concerned about the price of the gadgets and other features - like a dual SIM-card phone, and long battery life - than an operating system, he added. US internet vs China internet Iginio Gagliardone, author of China Africa and the Future of the Internet, agreed that the ongoing tussle between China and the US could just be what pushes Huawei to increase the use of its own software to support its burgeoning smartphone market. But he told the BBC it wouldn't be cheap or easy to build this capacity. It would also be difficult to export the closed internet model from China, which would mean requiring customers to use Baidu rather than Google and Sina Weibo instead of Twitter. However, WeChat, a multipurpose app that combines social media platforms, messaging and mobile payments, could take off in Africa. So will Africa be forced to make a choice? \"African countries should not choose a side, in fact it would be interesting if during this tech cold war it could form a non-aligned movement that looks after its interests,\" Mr Gagliardone said. His research, despite suspicion, has not found any evidence that China has been actively urging countries in Africa to adopt its censored version of the internet. \"What you see is that China is providing products that have been requested by African governments,\" Mr Gagliardone said. However, Mr Gagliardone thinks that China, in its push to protect its businesses, could leverage its relationship with African governments to develop protocols that give its companies an advantage over the West. \"I, however, don't see the consumer market being affected, I still see consumers continue to have access to different products to choose from,\" he said. The ensuing tech cold war is an opportunity and the continent should not be forced to pick a side, according to Ms Kariuki. However, according to Fazlin Fransman, from South Africa's Moja Research Institute, \"the current internet and technology boom [in Africa] is in significant part because of the investment of Chinese tech companies. Africa, in her view, has already picked a side, and it is China.", "summary": "La décision de Google de ne plus permettre à Huawei d'utiliser son logiciel Android est considérée comme le début d'une guerre froide technologique qui pourrait obliger les pays africains - dans le futur - à choisir entre la technologie américaine et chinoise, affirment des analystes interrogés par la BBC."}

Police used rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the stone-throwing protesters who had blockaded streets with burning barricades. The clashes led President Cyril Ramaphosa to appeal for calm. South Africa's police are often accused of using excessive force - security forces have been accused of killing at least 10 people this year while enforcing a lockdown imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus. \"There is no evidence of any provocation and it's difficult to understand why live ammunition could be used in a community such as this,\" Archbishop Malusi Mpumlwana, head of the South African Council of Churches, told local media outside the Julius household. \"We can't say Black Lives Matter in the United States if we don't say it in South Africa,\" he said. South Africa's tragic resignation to violence Nathaniel Julius' death has shocked many, not just in South Africa but also around the world. His killing has touched a special nerve in the US, where there have been months of protests over police brutality. Several US personalities have tweeted about Julius' death, including Beyoncé's sister, Solange Knowles. Here in South Africa, his community is outraged - they not only want answers, but justice. But South Africans are sadly used to being failed by the justice system, no matter how many times they protest, no matter how many times stories of gruesome violence make local and even international news. Even in the face of these arrests, few are encouraged that anything will change. That resignation to violence is one of this society's great tragedies. What is Down's syndrome?

He is the founder of campaign group People Against Race Classification. He opposes the use of race categories: \"black\", \"coloured\", \"Indian\" and \"white\" on official documentation, including job-application forms. These are used to monitor attempts to give extra opportunities to those who faced discrimination under apartheid. Since 2010 Mr Snyman has been campaigning against the use of the race categories, saying that he regards himself \"first and foremost\" as a South African. According to local news site TimesLive the primary school teacher identified as \"African\" while applying for a headteacher job in 2017. It says he didn't get the job. The news site reports that it has seen the charge sheet from education authorities in the Western Cape accusing Mr Snyman of fraud. \"You committed a common law offence, to wit fraud, by stating on your CV when applying for the principal post at Fezekile Secondary School that you are an African male, whereas in truth your records indicate that you are a coloured male and by doing so gain an advantage for purposes of being shortlisted,\" the charge said. Mr Snyman has not commented. Any employee can change their personnel record, Western Cape provincial education department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond told TimesLive. But it's unclear how race issues would be handled. In its simplest form, Mr Snyman is accused of trying to benefit from the system unfairly. Why? Well, racial classifications still matter in South Africa 26 years after the end of white-minority rule. The new policies ushered in with the birth of democracy were aimed at reversing some of the many injustices of the apartheid regime - injustices whose severity were largely based on people's race. Simply, the further you were from looking white the worse it got. If you consider a ladder, black people or so called Africans were right at the bottom of the ladder. Coloured (or mixed-race) people and Indian people were placed higher on the race hierarchy under apartheid. This does not mean they were not discriminated against - but rather were preferred to Africans. In present-day South Africa, some have said transformation has been slow and the sharing of opportunities even slower. And so many institutions wanting to address inequality are paying more attention to who they hire - meaning the colour of their skin. They say this is not aimed at overlooking qualifications but simply at making sure that those people are not left out as has been the practice in the past. When applying for a job this can mean stating your race and even gender for certain posts, especially government jobs. But racial policies are not without controversy - some minorities in South Africa have described them as \"reverse racism\". But in a country where economic mobility is still skewed along racial lines, these classifications, many say, help to even the playing field. Mr Snyman's case has however raised questions about how far people are allowed to choose their identity, how they self-identify, and what room there is - or isn't - in a country where race has been used as a weapon of oppression for centuries. It is a big question. What was apartheid?

But how has their relationship developed? The couple met through mutual friends in London in July 2016 when one of Ms Markle's close friends, Markus Anderson, reportedly introduced her to the prince. Mr Anderson, who sat next to Ms Markle at the Invictus Games, is linked with private members club Soho House - of which Harry is a member. But it wasn't until months after the initial London meeting that the press managed to get news of their blossoming romance. The Sunday Express was the first paper to reveal the 36-year-old was Prince Harry's new girlfriend with the news featuring on the front page last October. In the days after it broke, the pair went to a Halloween party where the prince reportedly donned a mask and went trick-or-treating. Press 'abuse and harass' Meghan In November 2016, the prince officially confirmed he was dating the US actress. In a statement from Kensington Palace, he also took the opportunity to condemn Ms Markle's treatment by the press. He referred to a \"smear\" on the front page of a national newspaper, racial undertones in comment pieces and \"outright sexism and racism\" from online trolls. There had been a \"bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life\", the prince said. He was worried about her safety and was \"deeply disappointed\" to not have been able to protect her. Digital editor of OK! Online Kelby McNally says the statement came as a \"surprise\" because their relationship hadn't been officially confirmed. \"This is proof that the younger generation of royals are moving away from some of the stereotypical stiff-upper lip royal behaviour,\" she says. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy, said it showed Harry's \"strong desire to both protect her and hang onto her\". The Duke of Cambridge signed off Harry's plea to the press agreeing the situation had gone too far. Prince William \"understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him\", a statement from Kensington Palace said. In mid-November of that year, Ms Markle was photographed out and about in Kensington doing some shopping in the high street, with the press suggesting she had been staying at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, where the prince lives. Talk turns to honeymoons Despite the couple trying to keep a lid on their affairs, a cheeky comment during a royal tour put the prince firmly back in the limelight. While on a 15-day trip to the West Indies later that month, Harry was made the offer to honeymoon in Antigua by the country's prime minister. In front of hundreds of guests, Gaston Browne said: \"I am told that there may be a princess and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon - then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you.\" The PM continued to stress the honeymoon credentials of his country but the prince didn't seem to respond to the invitation. In December the couple were gearing up for their first Christmas together. But where would they spend it - at Ms Markle's home in Toronto or London? The pair chose the latter to carry out their first festive tradition. They were pictured by the tabloids reportedly buying a £65 Nordmann Fir at the Pine and Needles store in Battersea Park, London. Actress Ms Markle was seen as a \"far cry\" from the prince's previous girlfriends which made their story all the more compelling, Ms McNally says. \"I think people are intrigued to see if much will change for her - after all, she is dating a real-life prince. Will she carry on her acting career as normal? Will they reside in the UK or the US?\" Later that month, the couple were pictured for the first time on a trip to London's West End. Prince Harry and Ms Markle were snapped strolling hand-in-hand before watching the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Gielgud Theatre. New year, next milestone. According to reports, they went on their first holiday together in January 2017. For their trip, the prince reportedly took Ms Markle to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, Norway after spending New Year together. The pair are thought to have stayed in a cabin for seven days where they went whale-watching and spent time on the nearby lake. In March the prince took Ms Markle as his plus one to one of his best friend's weddings in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher at the ceremony. Fast forward to May and Ms Markle was pictured at a polo match supporting her boyfriend. She was seen smiling and clapping as she watched Prince Harry play at Coworth Park, Berkshire. They didn't seem to hide their affections for one another as the prince kissed Ms Markle before the event, which he went on to win. It was one of several matches Princes Harry and William have played for charity. Wedding bells... but not theirs While all eyes were on Pippa Middleton's summer wedding many were intrigued to see if Ms Markle would attend and really be part of the family. Ms Middleton married financier boyfriend James Matthews in May at a ceremony in Englefield, Berkshire where crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dress, the royals and to see if Harry's girlfriend would turn up. She didn't attend the ceremony, but was snapped arriving for the evening reception with the prince fuelling more speculation about the couple's romance. In late August, the couple went on a three-week holiday to Africa to celebrate Meghan's 36th birthday and on their return Vanity Fair magazine declared Ms Markle was \"wild about Harry\". In an interview with the magazine she revealed they had been together for six months before the rest of the world found out. The actress said she had hoped people would understand \"this is our time\". \"We're two people who are really happy and in love. \"This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\" Not hiding any more In September, the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by Harry for injured soldiers. They sat separately at the opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada but were then pictured together as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event a few days later. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple strolling hand-in-hand and press rushed to capture the moment. Ms Markle's mother was also photographed with them at the closing ceremony of the games. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy said their relaxed appearance shows they were \"keen to present themselves to the world as a couple\". \"Were they 10 years younger it may be a case of 'wait and see', but they are two people in their mid-30s who know what they want from life - and who they want to share it with. \"It seems the public won't have to wait long for another royal wedding.\"", "summary": "Le Prince Harry va épouser sa fiancée, l'actrice de la série américaine Suits, Megan Markle, au printemps 2018."}

On Saturday protesters set fire to the Wendy's restaurant where the shooting occurred and police chief Erika Shields handed in her resignation. Atlanta is one of many US cities where the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police sparked protests. Mr Floyd, who was also African American, died after a white officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. His death has generated widespread anger against racism and police brutality. One of the Atlanta police officers involved in the latest shooting, Garrett Rolfe, has been sacked, and the other, Devin Bronsan, put on administrative duty. Erika Shields had served as Atlanta police chief since December 2016 after a long career in the force. Her resignation was announced by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. \"Because of her desire that Atlanta be a model of what meaningful reform should look like across this country, Chief Shields has offered to immediately step aside as police chief so that the city may move forward with urgency and rebuilding the trust so desperately needed throughout our communities,\" the mayor said in a statement. What happened on Friday night? The Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI), which is investigating, says the officers were called to the restaurant because Mr Brooks had fallen asleep in his car, which was blocking the drive-through lane. Body camera footage released by the police department shows the officers administering a sobriety test and then a breathalyser test with Mr Brooks' permission. The two officers then try to handcuff him - at which point their bodycams fall off. In security camera video, they can be seen struggling with Mr Brooks on the ground. He grabs an officer's Taser and breaks free from the officers, running away. The other then uses his Taser on Mr Brooks, and both officers then run out of the frame of the video. Gunshots can then be heard and Mr Brooks is seen on the ground. He was taken to hospital but later died. One of the officers was treated for an injury from the incident. The Fulton County prosecutor's office is conducting a separate investigation into the incident, it said in a statement. Lawyers representing Mr Brooks' family said the officer had no right to use deadly force, saying the Taser which Mr Brooks had grabbed was a non-lethal weapon. \"You can't shoot somebody unless they are pointing a gun at you,\" attorney Chris Stewart said. This is the 48th officer-involved shooting the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has investigated this year, according to ABC News. Of those cases, 15 were fatal. Protests began outside the restaurant late on Friday and resumed in central Atlanta on Saturday. Images from the protest show demonstrators holding signs with Brooks' name and Black Lives Matter signs. People in Atlanta had already been protesting following the death of George Floyd. The officer who killed him on 25 May has been sacked and charged with murder. What has happened in other US cities? Demonstrations have taken place across the US and across the world since Mr Floyd's death. Many in the US are calling for the police to be reformed. In Minneapolis, the city council passed a resolution on Friday to replace its police department with a community-led public safety system. The council said it would begin a year-long process of engaging \"with every willing community member in Minneapolis\" to come up with a new public safety model. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would stop financing local authorities that failed to adopt reforms addressing excessive use of force and bias in their police departments. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the chokehold method for restraining some suspects should, \"generally speaking\", be ended. He also postponed his first post-coronavirus lockdown election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma so it does not fall on 19 June, a date commemorating the end of US slavery. Mr Trump moved the rally to the 20th, following criticism. The location was also controversial, as one of the worst race massacres in US history took place in Tulsa, in 1921.", "summary": "La cheffe de la police d'Atlanta a démissionné après qu'un policier a mortellement blessé Rayshard Brooks, un suspect afro-américain au cours d'une tentative d'arrestation."}

More than 22,000 people have been infected with Ebola and 8,795 have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Scientists are starting to analyse hundreds of blood samples from Ebola patients in Guinea. They are tracking how the virus is changing and trying to establish whether it's able to jump more easily from person to person \"We know the virus is changing quite a lot,\" said human geneticist Dr Anavaj Sakuntabhai. \"That's important for diagnosing (new cases) and for treatment. We need to know how the virus (is changing) to keep up with our enemy.\" It's not unusual for viruses to change over a period time. Ebola is an RNA virus - like HIV and influenza - which have a high rate of mutation. That makes the virus more able to adapt and raises the potential for it to become more contagious. \"We've now seen several cases that don't have any symptoms at all, asymptomatic cases,\" said Anavaj Sakuntabhai. \"These people may be the people who can spread the virus better, but we still don't know that yet. A virus can change itself to less deadly, but more contagious and that's something we are afraid of.\" Latest figures There were fewer than 100 new cases in a week for the first time since June 2014. In the week to 25 January there were 30 cases in Guinea, four in Liberia and 65 in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization says the epidemic has entered a \"second phase\" with the focus shifting to ending the epidemic. But Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, says it's still unclear whether more people are actually not showing symptoms in this outbreak compared with previous ones. \"We know asymptomatic infections occur… but whether we are seeing more of it in the current outbreak is difficult to ascertain,\" he said. \"It could simply be a numbers game, that the more infection there is out in the wider population, then obviously the more asymptomatic infections we are going to see.\" Another common concern is that while the virus has more time and more \"hosts\" to develop in, Ebola could mutate and eventually become airborne. There is no evidence to suggest that is happening. The virus is still only passed through direct contact with infected people's body fluids. \"No blood borne virus, for example HIV or Hepatitis B, has ever shown any indication of becoming airborne. The mutation would need to be major,\" said infectious disease expert Professor David Heyman. Virologist Noel Tordo from the Institut Pasteur is in the Guinea capital Conakry. He said: \"At the moment, not enough has been done in terms of the evolution of the virus both geographically and in the human body, so we have to learn more. But something has shown that there are mutations. \"For the moment the way of transmission is still the same. You just have to avoid contact (with a sick person). \"But as a scientist you can't predict it won't change. Maybe it will.\" Researchers are using a method called genetic sequencing to track changes in the genetic make-up of the virus. So far they have analysed around 20 blood samples from Guinea. Another 600 samples are being sent to the labs in the coming months. A previous similar study in Sierra Leone showed the Ebola virus mutated considerably in the first 24 days of the outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. It said: \"This certainly does raise a lot of scientific questions about transmissibility, response to vaccines and drugs, use of convalescent plasma. \"However, many gene mutations may not have any impact on how the virus responds to drugs or behaves in human populations.\" 'Global problem' The research in Paris will also help give scientists a clearer insight into why some people survive Ebola, and others don't. The survival rate of the current outbreak is around 40%. It's hoped this will help scientists developing vaccines to protect people against the virus. Researchers at the Institut Pasteur are currently developing two vaccines which they hope will be in human trials by the end of the year. One is a modification of the widely used measles vaccine, where people are given a weakened and harmless form of the virus which in turn triggers an immune response. That response fights and defeats the disease if someone comes into contact with it. The idea, if it proves successful, would be that the vaccine would protect against both measles and Ebola. \"We've seen now this is a threat that can be quite large and can extend on a global scale,\" said Professor James Di Santo, and immunologist at the Institut. \"We've learned this virus is not a problem of Africa, it's a problem for everyone.\" He added: \"This particular outbreak may wane and go away, but we're going to have another infectious outbreak at some point, because the places where the virus hides in nature, for example in small animals, is still a threat for humans in the future. \"The best type of response we can think of… is to have vaccination of global populations.\"", "summary": "Des scientifiques travaillant sur le virus Ebola en Guinée ont déclaré à la BBC que le virus a muté depuis la découverte des premiers cas en mars 2014."}

And if all five take place, Mr Trump will be the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began this week, starting with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. The execution of 56-year-old Alfred Bourgeois will take place on the evening of 11 December. Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. \"This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,\" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. What is current policy in the US? Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting a combined 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. \"Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,\" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. What did the Trump administration do? In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. \"Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,\" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. \"The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. \"We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,\" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Now, four of the five prisoners scheduled to be put to death are African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was \"coincidental\" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of \"enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty\". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. \"One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,\" Ms Ndulue said. What is happening now? If Alfred Bourgeois' execution goes ahead as scheduled the 10 inmates executed in 2020 will bring a single-year total unmatched in modern history. \"We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,\" Ms Ndulue said. The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions, and said he would likely schedule more before he leaves the justice department. \"I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,\" he said. \"But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out.\" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. What is Biden's policy on the death penalty? Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general.

They appear to be members of a separatist militia. Captured on video and shared widely on social media, these are among dozens of clips that have been pouring out of Cameroon over the last six months, some of which have been analysed by BBC Africa Eye. Some of them show burning villages. Others record acts of torture and killing. Many are too graphic to show. Though often confusing and hard to verify, these films show a nation sliding towards a brutal civil war as the government tries to suppress an armed insurgency in the English-speaking areas of western Cameroon. The crisis in Anglophone Cameroon: What's happening in Cameroon? 'I share my home with 28 refugees' Footage recorded in late April this year shows a unit of at least 13 soldiers setting fire to a house in Azi, a village in Cameroon's Anglophone South-West region. BBC Africa Eye has confirmed the location by matching buildings to satellite imagery, and comparing the fire damage shown in a subsequent video from the same village. These men appear to be members of the government's security forces. Their fatigues, helmets and webbing are all consistent with those worn by Cameroon's Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), an elite army unit that has been equipped and trained by the US and Israel. A local resident also told the BBC that the troops who destroyed homes in Azi belonged to the BIR. But a government spokesperson says the men's identity is unclear. \"They [the separatists] are able to acquire military uniforms of the Rapid Intervention Battalion or any other brigade of the defence forces in order to perpetrate their crime and blame our defence and security forces for it,\" Cameroon's Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. He told the BBC the incident was being investigated to \"shed light on what exactly happened\". Burnt to the ground Amateur footage captured another attack on 29 April, this time on Munyenge, also in South-West region, showing the centre of the village ablaze. The BBC has spoken to three residents of Munyenge who all say that the village was destroyed by government forces. One man said that troops burned many houses, killed civilians and decapitated a body. Satellite imagery from before and after this attack shows the extent of the destruction. A few days later, in early May, a video posted to Facebook showed the nearby village of Kuke Mbomo after a raid allegedly by soldiers. BBC Africa Eye examined the footage frame by frame and confirmed its location. The video shows a man holding live ammunition and shouting to the camera: \"These are for us, for civilians, to kill us!\" Anglophone activists say close to 70 villages in the South-West have been targeted over the past year - and that the violence is continuing. Using satellite imagery, the BBC has identified at least four villages that have been extensively damaged by fire in recent months. Although we cannot confirm who is responsible for torching these villages, lawyer and activist Agbor Nkongho blames government forces. Colonial roots This is a conflict that has been building for decades. The division between Cameroon's French-speaking majority and its English-speaking minority has its roots in the colonial era. Cameroon was colonised by Germany and then split into British and French areas after World War One. After French-administered Cameroon gained independence in 1960, the two parts of the country formed a single nation the following year. This followed a referendum, when British-run Southern Cameroons voted to join the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon in 1961, while Northern Cameroons voted to join English-speaking Nigeria. Even then, some English-speakers felt they had been forced into the new republic. Cameroon became a federation of two states - one English-speaking, the other French-speaking - under one president. A decade later in 1972, another public vote saw Cameroon dropping its federal form to become a unitary state. Ever since, many Anglophones have complained that their regions were being neglected and excluded from power. Mobile phones banned for officers These simmering tensions bubbled over into violence in 2016. It started as a protest by lawyers and teachers demanding better provision for the use of English. But tensions rose, leading to confrontation between the security forces, a 93-day blackout of internet services across Anglophone Cameroon, and separatist militants fighting for the breakaway state of \"Ambazonia\". Since then, there have been reports of atrocities on all sides - kidnappings, extra-judicial killings and the burning of villages. Amnesty International says that English-speaking Cameroon is now gripped in a \"deadly cycle of violence\". The rights group alleges the government crackdown and unrest has gradually turned into an armed conflict, leaving the general population at the whim of two opposing forces. The government has taken some steps to address the issue of language, which sparked the crisis, setting up the National Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism last year. The communications minister also says incidents of alleged tortured are being investigated after a video, recorded in May 2018, appears to show military police officers abusing a separatist commander. BBC analysis places the footage outside the military police post in the village of Nkongle. \"If a soldier or soldiers were to be found guilty of such behaviour, I am telling you that they would be court-martialled immediately,\" Mr Bakary said. Schools torched by rebels It is not just the government accused of committing abuses. Separatist rebels have also killed Cameroonian security forces and attacked civilians accused of working with the government. The rebels have also attacked and burnt down schools - according to Amnesty at least 42 schools were attacked by armed separatists between February 2017 and May 2018. Anglophone activists called for a complete school boycott last year to exert further pressure on the authorities. Amnesty has images of a teacher who was shot for keeping his school open. A new video shows a village chief being beaten, apparently by a rebel who threatens to kill him. The government says that 81 members of the security forces and more than 100 civilians have been killed by separatists in the past year. No official figures are available for civilian and separatists' deaths at the hands of the security forces. Prime Minister Philémon Yang has accused Cameroonians living overseas of using social media to \"spread hate speech and terror\" and \"order murders\". More from BBC Africa Eye: This week, the gendarmerie - Cameroon's military police force - banned officers from using mobile phones or social networks such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter without permission. Aid agencies' efforts to assist civilians have been frustrated by the struggle to access conflict areas. As Cameroon's Anglophone crisis continues, both the UK and France have discreetly pressed for dialogue. The US Ambassador to Cameroon, Peter Barlerin, has taken a harder stance. He recently accused the army of burning and looting villages and also suggested that after 35 years in power, President Paul Biya might want to consider stepping down. Cameroon faces increasing international scrutiny in its approach to the crisis, with general elections scheduled for October 2018. Thousands of families have been forced from their homes by the fighting. While 21,000 people have fled across the border into Nigeria, the UN estimates that a further 160,000 are displaced within Cameroon. Many others are still hiding in the forest.", "summary": "Un homme met calmement feu à une maison, sous le regard d'un groupe d'au moins 12 hommes vêtus de treillis, de casques et de sangles noires, semblables à ceux portés par une unité de l'armée d'élite au Cameroun."}

It will also be used for military co-operation, naval exercises and rescue missions, Xinhua said. China has ramped up investment in Africa, as well as rapidly modernised its military in recent years. The Xinhua report said the ships departed from the port city of Zhanjiang in China's southern Guangdong province on Tuesday. It did not specify the number of troops or ships that departed for Djibouti, nor when the base would start operations. The report said the Djibouti base came after \"friendly negotiations\" between the two countries. Previous reports said construction began last year. The base is widely seen as a move by China to stake its military presence in the region. But an editorial (in Chinese) on Wednesday in the state-run Global Times said that the \"essential purpose of China's development of its military might is to protect 'China's safety', and is not about seeking to control the world\". The newspaper pointed out that the US, Japan and France also have military bases in Djibouti. Djibouti, a tiny country at the Horn of Africa, is favoured for its location as it sits near a busy shipping route. It is also seen as a stable country in an otherwise volatile region. In 2015, at a major summit with African nations, China pledged to invest $60bn (then £40bn) in Africa's development. Besides becoming the continent's largest trading partner, it has also poured in funds and manpower for infrastructure projects. Many of them are railways linking up African countries, including one that connects Djibouti with the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, as well as railways in Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. In return, Africa supplies China with natural resources, minerals and energy.

Our ancestors settled for 70,000 years, until the local climate changed, researchers have proposed. They began to move on as fertile green corridors opened up, paving the way for future migrations out of Africa. \"It has been clear for some time that anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago,\" said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. \"What has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors.\" Prof Hayes' conclusions have drawn scepticism from other researchers in the field, however. Lakeland haven The area in question is south of the Zambezi basin, in northern Botswana. The researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's huge lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now an area of sprawling salt flats. \"It's an extremely large area, it would have been very wet, it would have been very lush,\" said Prof Hayes. \"And it would have actually provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived.\" After staying there for 70,000 years, people began to move on. Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up. The first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today. This scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans. By combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago. Reconstructing the human story However, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone. Other analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process. \"You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins,\" he told BBC News. \"I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins.\" Thus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down.

The company, which began as a Berlin-based start-up 12 years ago, now has 36 million customers and recorded revenue of €6.5bn (£5.8bn) last year. He will step down in May, cutting short a contract that runs to late-2023. \"My wife and I have agreed that for the coming years, her professional ambitions should take priority,\" Mr Ritter said in a statement. \"I want to devote more time to my growing family. After more than 11 amazing years where Zalando has been my priority, I feel that it is time to give my life a new direction.\" The company declined to name Mr Ritter's wife or her occupation. But it said the couple had one child and were expecting another in early 2021. Mr Ritter, 38, earned €6.8m in 2019 and €20.2m in 2018, making him one of Germany's highest paid executives. Zalando's other two bosses, Robert Gentz and David Schneider, will continue to lead the company, the firm said. Mr Ritter has been spearheading efforts to improve equality at Zalando, which sells fashion and beauty products in 17 countries. Currently no women sit on its management board and its gender pay gap is 22% in favour of men, slightly wider than the national average in Germany. However, in November Mr Ritter said the retailer was progressing towards its goal of achieving balanced representation in its top tiers of management by 2023. \"While transformation takes time, and we are still at the beginning of our journey, our progress indicates that we are moving in the right direction,\" Mr Ritter said. The executive has been in charge of strategy and communications on the three-way management team, but he was also finance chief until last year. Commenting on Mr Ritter's decision, Mr Gentz said: \"When we started to ship the first shoes to our customers from the basement of our office, we did not know where the journey would lead us. \"It is impossible to overstate Rubin's impact on Zalando's success.\" Zalando's customers are spread across 17 countries.

He had sent out a warning to fellow medics on 30 December but police told him to stop \"making false comments\". There had been contradictory reports about his death, but the People's Daily now says he died at 02:58 on Friday (18:58 GMT Thursday). The virus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 in mainland China, the National Health Commission's latest figures show. The death toll includes 73 new deaths reported on Thursday. The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. What is Li Wenliang's story? Dr Li, an ophthalmologist, posted his story on Weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning. The 34-year-old had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like Sars - the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003. On 30 December he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. Four days later he was summoned to the Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign a letter. In the letter he was accused of \"making false comments\" that had \"severely disturbed the social order\". He was one of eight people who police said were being investigated for \"spreading rumours\" Local authorities later apologised to Dr Li. In his Weibo post he describes how on 10 January he started coughing, the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 January. How has China reacted? A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke late on Thursday. The top two trending hashtags on the website were \"Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang and apology\" and \"We want freedom of speech\". Both hashtags were quickly censored. When the BBC searched Weibo on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of comments had already been wiped. Many have now taken to posting under the hashtag \"Can you manage, do you understand?\" - a reference to the letter Dr Li was told to sign where he was accused of disturbing \"social order\". Only a handful of critical comments now remain - many of which do not directly name him - but are an indication of the mounting anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. \"Do not forget how you feel now. Do not forget this anger. We must not let this happen again,\" said one comment on Weibo. \"The truth will always be treated as a rumour. How long are you going to lie? Are you still lying? What else do you have to hide?\" another said. 'An epic political disaster' Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The death of Dr Li Wenliang has been a heart-breaking moment for this country. For the Chinese leadership it is an epic political disaster. It lays bare the worst aspects of China's command and control system of governance under Xi Jinping - and the Communist Party would have to be blind not to see it. If your response to a dangerous health emergency is for the police to harass a doctor trying to blow the whistle, then your structure is obviously broken. The city's mayor - reaching for excuses - said he needed clearance to release critical information which all Chinese people were entitled to receive. Now the spin doctors and censors will try to find a way to convince 1.4 billion people that Dr Li's death is not a clear example of the limits to the party's ability to manage an emergency - when openness can save lives, and restricting it can kill. Chinese people are going to take some convincing. Why was there confusion over his death? Global Times, People's Daily and other Chinese media reported Dr Li's death earlier on Thursday. Dr Li, was initially declared dead at 21:30 local time and the news triggered a huge wave of popular reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The People's Daily sent out a tweet saying Dr Li's death had sparked \"national grief\". However, Global Times then said he had been given a treatment known as ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) which keeps a person's heart pumping and keeps their blood oxygenated without it going through their lungs. Global Times said he was in a critical condition. Journalists and doctors at the scene, who do not want their names used, told the BBC and other media that government officials had intervened. Official media outlets had been told to change their reports to say the doctor was still being treated. The media outlets then later reported the new time of Dr Li's death: Most of those killed by coronavirus have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions, according to China's health authorities. Dr Li's medical history is not known. What is the latest on the virus in China? China is introducing more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak. Beijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day. Hubei province has switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside. Its capital, Wuhan, has a lack of beds and equipment, one senior city official said. Despite the rapid construction of two hospitals, the volume of patients is causing severe strain. Reports on social media say the Wuhan government is to carry out door-to-door temperature checks on residents. There has been criticism of the crackdowns, with Human Rights Watch saying China was \"treating public health with a sledgehammer\". Meanwhile, Hong Kong has seen panic buying of goods, including toilet rolls, and there have been huge queues for masks. What's the latest on infections? Although the virus has spread overseas, with confirmed infection in some 25 nations, there have so far been only two deaths outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, saying if funds are not allocated now to tackle the outbreak, nations would pay for it later. Although the official figures in China are of 31,000 infections, some scientists have estimated that the actual rate could be 10 times higher, with the majority of infected people only presenting mild symptoms, not receiving treatment, yet passing on the potentially deadly disease. The UK on Thursday confirmed a third case of the virus. Some 3,700 people on the Diamond Princess cruise vessel moored off Japan face testing and quarantine for at least two weeks. On Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK said 41 new cases had been detected on board, bringing the total to 61. Another cruise ship with 3,600 passengers and crew is quarantined in Hong Kong with three cases on board. Learn more about the new virus Have you been affected by any of the issues raised?

The British singer then appeared to break the award in two accidentally and offer a piece to her fellow nominee. Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists. Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis. Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not \"seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down\". Two years ago, West rushed onto the stage in protest when Beck's Morning Phase beat Beyonce's last LP in the best album race. However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1. It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened. The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too \"commercialised\". Main winners Whatever the outcome, Adele remains one of the night's biggest winners. She won five prizes in all, including three of the top four: Best album, song of the year and record of the year - the latter two both rewarding her 2015 comeback single, Hello. Chicago's Chance the Rapper also took three prizes, including best rap album for his self-released record Coloring Book. \"I know people think independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom,\" he said as he picked up best new act at the start of the ceremony. Rock icon David Bowie won in each of the five categories he was nominated for, including best alternative album, for Blackstar, and best rock performance, for the album's title track. And Beyonce wasn't left completely empty-handed: she took home best urban contemporary album and best music video, for the politically-charged Formation. The star, who is pregnant with twins, also gave an ambitious and logistically complex performance of the songs Love Drought and Sandcastles, themed around the ideas of rebirth, regeneration and healing. Dressed in flowing, golden Egyptian robes and an elaborate headdress, she dedicated the performance to motherhood, proudly displaying her baby bump as she sang. But while Beyonce's performance was flawless, others were marred by technical issues. Lady Gaga duetted with Metallica on the song Moth to the Flame, but singer James Hetfield was inaudible throughout the first verse. He later sang cheek-to-cheek with Gaga, sharing her microphone, but angrily threw his guitar to one of his roadies at the end of the performance. Adele also went off-key during a tribute to George Michael, and tearfully asked if the song could be started again. It was, and she received a standing ovation for her troubles. Respects were paid to Sir George Martin, Leonard Cohen and other musicians we lost in 2016, while Bruno Mars honoured Prince by playing the star's trademark cloud guitar in a pitch-perfect rendition of Let's Go Crazy.

The 30,000 \"selfies\" are being used in a conservation project to help save endangered elephants. The researchers are developing new technology to help reduce human-elephant conflicts in countries where elephants roam free. Alasdair Davies is conservation technology expert at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). He said the project had implications for both wild elephants and the people they live alongside in Africa and Asia. He told BBC News: \"It can detect elephants confidently at a certain distance - and we want to get this into the field now and actually put it in the wild helping wild animals and communities live side-by-side.\" The database of thermal images has been used to train cameras to recognise what an elephant looks like from the heat it gives off. The cameras are able to detect when an elephant is close by - even in the dark - and send an alert. Clashes between humans and elephants pose a grave threat to the survival of wild elephants in Asia and Africa. People and elephants are being forced into ever closer contact as the human population grows and wild habitat disappears. This can end in trashed crops, damaged property and the loss of lives. India alone reports annual deaths of 400 people and 100 elephants through conflicts arising when elephants damage crops or homes. Dr Kate Evans of conservation charity, Elephants for Africa, said conflict between humans and elephants is a growing problem. \"Elephants are iconic species and they're really important to the ecology and economy of many countries so it's important we conserve them, however if you're a subsistence farmer bordering a national park or a protected area then living with elephants comes at a very big price.\" The hope is that the new technology will be an affordable solution to helping wildlife and humans live in harmony - and help protect endangered species. But ZSL warns that conservation efforts like these are put at threat by the funding crisis affecting UK zoos. A spokesperson said: \"In 2020, ZSL lost £20m of income due to the closures of London and Whipsnade Zoos, and the strictly limited visitor capacities when they were open.\" Last month, Chester Zoo announced that it was putting some conservation work in Africa and Asia on hold because of the impact of Covid on its finances.

His latest comments come two months after he was convicted in a hate speech trial over his promise to reduce the number of Moroccans in the country. Mr Wilders addressed his supporters on Saturday amid tight security in his party's stronghold of Spijkenisse, an ethnically diverse area near Rotterdam. \"There is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe,\" he said. \"If you want to regain your country, make the Netherlands for the people of the Netherlands again, then you can only vote for one party.\" He emphasised that he thought \"not all are scum\".

But his nearest rival, right-wing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, has narrowed the lead with just a month until the election is held. The BBC's Anna Holligan, in The Hague, said Mr Wilders's championing of US President Donald Trump's policies appears to be backfiring, as many Dutch voters believe Mr Trump is bad for global stability. Even if Mr Wilders wins, he may struggle to put together a coalition, as leading parties have said they would not work with him. Mr Wilders's three-week trial last year was triggered when police received 6,400 complaints about remarks he had made during a municipal election campaign in The Hague. At a rally, he asked supporters whether they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands\". When the crowd shouted back \"Fewer! Fewer!\" a smiling Mr Wilders responded: \"We're going to take care of that.\" At the trial, prosecutors took testimony from Dutch-Moroccans who said his comments made them feel like \"third-rate citizens\".

She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency \"for everyone to make payments everywhere\".

This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about £250,000. \"I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'\" he recalls. \"And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' \"I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'\" The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. \"So we need you to build a blockchain,\" he went on. \"What's the name of the company?\" asked Bjercke. \"It's OneCoin.\" He didn't take the job. Jen McAdam's 'tycoon' package One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were \"very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion\", she remembers. \"You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,\" she was told. \"You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger.\" The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. \"That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her.\" By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest €1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe €1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost €140, but they went all the way up to €118,000. One week later McAdam bought a \"tycoon\" package, for €5,000. Before long, she had invested €10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest €250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed £100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - \"the biggest scam in the [expletive] world\". He said he could prove it, too. \"Well then prove it to me!\" she replied, sharply. Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. \"OK Jen… they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database.\" But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. \"I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'\" she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Dr Ruja disappears Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop star Bebe Rexha performed a private set. Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. \"She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,\" recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. MLM's most successful product Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. \"When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,\" he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan \"What dreams may come\". A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made €100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay £100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her \"princess's dresses\" and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. \"We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,\" he says. \"We made in our first month almost €90,000 out of nothing. Bang!\" Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as \"the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM\". This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its \"product\". No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than €1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. \"No other company even came close,\" Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than €2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buy more OneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. \"I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,\" Igor says. \"I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to €100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that.\" The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. \"I felt responsibility. Not guilt,\" he replies. \"You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchain… What doubt can I have?\" He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was €3,000 - €1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. Following the money It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say €4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as €15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, \"Follow the money.\" So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. \"They still exist\", he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. \"You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible.\" It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as \"improbably standard\". For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. \"British companies are the companies of choice,\" he comments. \"They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate.\" He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. \"We are very proud of this in this country,\" he says. \"The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided.\" He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. \"This is classic,\" he exclaims. \"Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all.\" Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with \"significant control\" - the real owner. \"This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,\" he says, as he scrolls down the page. \"Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegal… That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu.\" So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Find out more Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. \"When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up,\" says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. \"If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away,\" he says. When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. \"I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast.\" According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. \"Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,\" Bjercke says. \"I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip.\" Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of \"very influential people\". When I ask for more details, he replies: \"No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives.\" It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and \"significant players in Eastern European organised crime\". Inside 'the family' On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested ,and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the \"visionary\" Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin \"family\". She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own \"leader\" who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. \"You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',\" she recalls. \"That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'\" Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. \"If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,\" she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. \"When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,\" she says. \"Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'\" Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. \"And in that sense it's cultic.\" In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. \"We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,\" it said. \"We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers.\" Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. \"There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,\" said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. \"If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over.\" Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. \"The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,\" it said. \"We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors.\" Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. \"I'm devastated for all the UK victims,\" Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. \"Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!\" The City of London Police told the BBC: \"There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online.\" Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. A Ugandan tragedy In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. \"There was no other way,\" he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. \"Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced.\" If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. \"I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money.\" But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. \"One Life!\" he shouts. \"One Coin!\" the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about £3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. \"I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,\" he tells me. \"I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work.\" I ask him why not. \"It's hard. It's hard to say.\" Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. \"Maybe you can tell her… Maybe…\" he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. \"If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,\" she says. \"You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard.\" Where are you, Dr Ruja? When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. \"What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,\" he says. \"Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family.\" Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. \"In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,\" he says. A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. \"You will find her,\" he said. \"You must dig deeper.\" She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were \"haters\" who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a \"big passport\", he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: \"OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency.\" It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast \"will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased\". It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: \"Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.\" OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.", "summary": "Ruja Ignatova se faisait appeler la \"Reine de la monnaie numérique\".

US doctors took the unprecedented step to ensure the baby boy would be free of a genetic condition that his Jordanian mother carries in her genes. Experts say the move heralds a new era in medicine and could help other families with rare genetic conditions. But they warn that rigorous checks of this new and controversial technology, called mitochondrial donation, are needed. It's not the first time scientists have created babies that have DNA from three people - that breakthrough began in the late 1990s - but it is an entirely new and significant method. Three person babies Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into usable energy. Some women carry genetic defects in mitochondria and they can pass these on to their children. In the case of the Jordanian family, it was a disorder called Leigh Syndrome that would have proved fatal to any baby conceived. The family had already experienced the heartache of four miscarriages as well as the death of two children - one at eight months and the other at six years of age. Leigh syndrome Scientists have devised a number of fertility methods to help such families. The US team, who travelled to Mexico to carry out the procedure because there are no laws there that prohibit it, used a method that takes all the vital DNA from the mother's egg plus healthy mitochondria from a donor egg to create a healthy new egg that can be fertilised with the father's sperm. The result is a baby with 0.1% of their DNA from the donor (mitochondrial DNA) and all the genetic code for things like hair and eye colour from the mother and father. Dr John Zhang, medical director at the New Hope Fertility Centre in New York City, and his colleagues used the method to make five embryos - only one of them developed normally. The UK has already passed laws to allow the creation of babies from three people. But the science does raise ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Fertility experts say it is important to push ahead, but cautiously. Some have questioned whether we are only now hearing the success story while failed attempts could have gone unreported. Prof Alison Murdoch, part of the team at Newcastle University that has been at the forefront of three person IVF work in the UK, said: \"The translation of mitochondrial donation to a clinical procedure is not a race but a goal to be achieved with caution to ensure both safety and reproducibility.\" Critics say the work is irresponsible. Dr David King from the pro-choice group Human Genetics Alert, said: \"It is outrageous that they simply ignored the cautious approach of US regulators and went to Mexico, because they think they know better. Since when is a simplistic \"to save lives is the ethical thing to do\" a balanced medical ethics approach, especially when no lives were being saved?\" Dr Zhang and his team say they will answer these questions when they presents their findings at a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. Prof Darren Griffin, an expert in Genetics at the University of Kent, said: \"This study heralds a new era in preimplantation genetics and represents a novel means for the treatment of families at risk of transmitting genetic disease. \"With radical new treatments like this there are always challenging ethical issues, however any concerns need to be balanced against the ramifications of not implementing such a technology when families are in need of it.\" The structure of a cell Nucleus: Where the majority of our DNA is held - this determines how we look and our personality Mitochondria: Often described as the cell's factories, these create the energy to make the cell function Cytoplasm: The jelly like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria Follow Michelle on Twitter", "summary": "Le premier bébé conçu avec la technique consistant à utiliser l'ADN de trois personnes est né en avril dernier, a annoncé la revue britannique \"New Scientist\", ce mardi 27 septembre."}

Campaigners have called for ongoing civil disobedience from Sunday to make it as difficult as possible for the military to govern Sudan. It comes days after a military crackdown left dozens dead. A number of Sudan's bank, airport and electricity workers were arrested ahead of the strike against the military rule, the main protest group said. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) said employees were also being threatened by the authorities to scare them into going to work instead of taking part in the nationwide strike. The ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) has made no comment. What is the background? The military took over Sudan after persistent protests led to the ousting of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April. They promised a transition to civilian rule. But pro-democracy campaigners say the military council cannot be trusted after Monday's crackdown against a sit-in demonstration in Khartoum - and they have rejected an offer of talks. In a separate development, three opposition figures involved in mediation efforts have been arrested. What's the latest from Khartoum? Groups of young men have set up barricades in roads as part of the civil disobedience campaign. Most offices and businesses remain shut and traffic is light in the city, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the Sudanese capital. There have been reports of gunfire as security forces maintain their deployments across most parts of the city. Protest leaders have asked people to stay at home. They say that demonstrations are no longer possible because of the violent crackdown by the military. \"The civil disobedience movement will begin Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,\" the SPA said in a statement. \"Disobedience is a peaceful act capable of bringing to its knees the most powerful weapons arsenal in the world.\" What about the opposition arrests? Opposition politician Mohamed Esmat was detained on Friday soon after his meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, aides said. Meanwhile, Ismail Jalab, a leader of the rebel SPLM-N group, and his spokesman Mubarak Ardol were arrested early on Saturday. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, and analysts say the arrests suggest that Ethiopian mediation efforts have not been taken seriously by the military. On Wednesday, the SPLM-N said its deputy head, Yasir Arman, was arrested at his house in Khartoum. He had returned from exile following the downfall of Mr Bashir. Mr Esmat and Mr Jalab are both leading members of the Alliance for Freedom and Change, an umbrella organisation of opposition figures, protest leaders and rebel groups. \"This amounts to a practical response from the military council that effectively rejects the Ethiopian prime minister's mediation effort,\" Khalid Omar Yousef, an opposition alliance leader said. The TMC seems emboldened by the political and financial support it has received from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, none of which are keen on fully fledged democracy, says BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper. How bad was Monday's violence? Opposition activists say a feared paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killed 108 people in the crackdown, with at least 40 bodies pulled from the River Nile in Khartoum on Tuesday. The Sudanese authorities however, put the figure at 46. The leader of the RSF says rogue elements and drug dealers were behind the violence. The RSF, formerly known as the Janjaweed militia, gained notoriety for brutal atrocities in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan in 2003. Khartoum residents have told the BBC that they are living in fear in the capital. A number of women arrested by the RSF said they were repeatedly beaten with sticks and threatened with execution. They said RSF troops had told them to run for their lives, then opened fire. Other victims, they said, were forced to drink sewage water and urinated on.

It is just one of the research priorities of the new International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection. Working together on early detection of cancer will mean patients benefitting more quickly, it says. Cancer Research UK has teamed up with the Universities of Cambridge, Manchester, University College London, and Stanford and Oregon in the US, to share ideas, technology and expertise in this area. Already there Together, the scientists are aiming to develop less invasive tests, such as blood, breath and urine tests, for monitoring high-risk patients, improve imaging techniques for detecting cancer early and look for virtually undetectable signs of the disease. But they admit this is \"like looking for a needle in a haystack\" and could be 30 years off. \"The fundamental problem is that we never get to see a cancer being born in a human being,\" says Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK. \"By the time it's found, it's already established.\" Researchers from Manchester, for example, are growing human breast tissue in the lab with synthetic immune cells to see if they can spot the very earliest, subtle changes that could lead to cancer. Prof Rob Bristow said it was akin to a \"living tissue bank outside patients\". Yet there is always the danger of over-diagnosis, because not all early cell changes turn into cancers. So the cancer researchers say they must be more precise, also looking at the genes people are born with and the environment they grow up in, to work out an individual's unique personal risk of different cancers. Only then will they know when to intervene. 'Expensive firefighting' To date, scientists say research on early detection has been small-scale and disconnected, lacking the power of trials in big populations of people. Dr Crosby said the collaboration would \"induce a sea-change in our health systems, shifting it from expensive firefighting of late-stage disease, to being able to intervene at its earliest point and deliver rapid, cost-effective treatment\". Figures show that 98% of breast cancer patients live for five years or more if the disease is diagnosed at stage 1 - the earliest stage- compared to just 26% at stage 4, the most advanced stage. But, at present, only around 44% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at the earliest stage. In the UK, screening programmes exist for breast, bowel and cervical cancers, when people reach a particular age. However, there are currently no reliable screening tools for other cancers, such as pancreas, liver, lung and prostate, which means survival rates are often much lower. Prof Mark Emberton, from UCL, said the growth of imaging, such as MRI, was a \"silent revolution\" which could replace needles, used in biopsies, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. \"Imaging only sees the aggressive cells, it overlooks the stuff you don't want to find and addresses over-diagnosis,\" he said, but he warned it was expensive and took time, and was \"not ready for prime time yet\". More accurate hyper-polarised MRI scans and photo acoustics, where laser light is delivered to the tumour, creating sound waves which are analysed to produce images, are the next advances being tested in imaging. Prof Emberton said the next goal was to see which cancers lent themselves to this type of imaging. At the University of Cambridge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald is developing an advanced endoscope to detect pre-cancerous lesions in the food pipe and colon. She said early detection hadn't been given the attention it deserved, and some tests for cancer could be very simple and inexpensive. Prof Fitzgerald said she looked forward to working with international colleagues to take ideas \"all the way from the bench to the bedside\". Cancer Research UK is investing £40m in the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection over the next five years, with $20m being contributed by Canary Center at Stanford University and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.", "summary": "Des scientifiques britanniques et américains s'associent pour rechercher les premiers signes du cancer afin de détecter et de traiter la maladie avant son apparition."}

Dr Li was arrested by authorities for \"spreading rumours\", and later died after catching the virus. After a public outcry over his death, he was exonerated and honoured as a hero by the government. His widow, Mrs Fu, now has two sons with her late husband. In her message she wrote: \"Husband, can you see this from heaven? You have given me your final gift today. I will of course love and protect them.\" Mrs Fu told local news outlet Litchi News that after her husband's death she suffered from health problems brought on by grief and had to be temporarily hospitalised to keep the unborn baby safe. She described Dr Li as a responsible doctor and loving husband, and said her family initially hid his death from their other child, saying that \"Dad went abroad.\" Her baby photo has been commented on by thousands of users on the Chinese social network Weibo, many offering well-wishes. Others left comments asking the media to not bother the family. Who was Li Wenliang? Dr Li was an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak. In December he sent a message to fellow doctors saying that he had noticed seven cases of a virus he thought looked like Sars - a disease that spread globally in 2003. He warned them in a group chat to wear protective gear to avoid infection. Days later, he was told by police to \"stop making false comments\" and was investigated along with eight other doctors for \"spreading rumours.\" Soon after Dr Li contracted coronavirus from a patient and shared his experiences on social media before he died in February. His death prompted a wave of public anger over the government's handling of the outbreak, with accusations that it downplayed the severity of the virus and initially tried to keep it secret. A BBC search of social media at the time showed thousands of critical remarks on Weibo were censored. After an investigation, Chinese authorities apologised to Dr Li's family and admitted to \"shortcomings and deficiencies\" in their response. Along with 13 other frontline workers, Dr Li was commended as a \"martyr\" in April for sacrificing his life to fight coronavirus. As a result, under Chinese law it is now an arrestable offence to criticise him. A 'martyr' in China's epidemic fight? Analysis by Kerry Allen, BBC China analyst The government wants people in China to remember Dr Li Wenliang as a \"martyr\" in China's epidemic fight - the highest honour anybody can be granted posthumously. Anyone who makes negative comments about a \"martyr\" can actually be held criminally accountable under China's \"Heroes and Martyrs Protection Law\". But the Chinese public have not forgotten how the local authorities in Wuhan initially tried to punish Dr Li himself from sharing his concerns in December about the virus. When he died in February, there was widespread anger across China. Furious comments poured in from social media users on Sina Weibo and WeChat criticising the state, on such a scale that government censors struggled to take them all offline. Many still perceive that his muzzling could have prevented thousands of lives, including his own, from being lost, and feel personally affected by his death. \"More should have been done at the time,\" wrote one user on the Weibo social media network today. Other users asked that the state found a way to make amends by ensuring the safety and protection of his widow and his children. \"It is all of our responsibility to educate future generations on Wenliang,\" wrote one.", "summary": "Li Wenliang, est le médecin chinois qui a tiré la sonnette d'alarme sur l'épidémie de coronavirus dans le pays et qui est mort de cette maladie ."}

Boris Johnson, who is 55, has been discharged from St Thomas' hospital in London after being in intensive care. He was given oxygen, but didn't need a ventilator machine to help his breathing. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said male sex is \"a very clear risk factor\". But why? Which people can get sick? Some people are at higher risk of complications. This includes people over the age of 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as heart disease. There are more than 1.5 million people in the UK who are at the greatest risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus. This includes people with cancer who have been receiving chemotherapy, and they are being asked to stay at home all of the time to shield themselves from the virus. Coronavirus also appears to disproportionately affect men in their 50s and 60s to a certain degree, although they are not singled out as a high risk group. But it's not that clear-cut. Correlation isn't necessarily cause. Why older men? Scientists are unsure. UK data from intensive care hospital wards shows the average patient who is critically ill is aged 60. Most are men and many have other health conditions that could put them at increased risk, such as heart problems and obesity. Of the 647 coronavirus-related deaths registered by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales up to the week ending 27th March, 44 were aged 45-65 - around 7% of the total. Death rates go up with age in both men and women, but men tend to outstrip women across the ages. Data from China, where the pandemic began, also suggests men are at greater risk than women, although experts caution there could be factors other than gender, such as smoking habits, that could explain the link. Prof Ian Hall, Professor of Molecular Medicine, University of Nottingham, said: \"I am not convinced this completely explains the increased risk of severe disease in men, so it seems possible there may be some other as yet unidentified factor playing a role.\" Men are more likely than women to have heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease. Some have suggested genes and sex hormones might be involved too. Are women more immune? Prof Philip Goulder, an expert in immunology at University of Oxford, said: \"It is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases. \"The immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males.\" This could be down to women carrying two copies of the X chromosome, compared to the single X and a Y that men have. A number of critical immune genes are located on the X chromosome, he says. Is coronavirus causing the deaths? Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. People with underlying health conditions and the elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. The Office for National Statistics has been assessing how many of the deaths linked to coronavirus might be as a direct result of the virus. This analysis suggests that most (86% or 3,372) of the 4,000 deaths linked to coronavirus in March were likely caused by the virus, although around nine in every ten of those who died had a pre-existing health condition. The coronavirus death rate was twice as high for men compared to women - 97.5 deaths per 100,000 population versus 46.5 deaths per 100,000. How can you protect yourself? Stay as fit and healthy as you can by exercising and eating a balanced diet. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. Men are more likely than women to: Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. What if I get coronavirus symptoms? If you have a new, continuous cough or a fever you should stay at home and self-isolate for at least seven days. If you, or someone you live with, develop symptoms, the entire household needs to isolate for 14 days to monitor for signs of the disease. What should I do if my symptoms don't get better? The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what you need to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words then you will be told to call 999 as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then the website will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111.", "summary": "La plupart des personnes atteintes de coronavirus se rétablissent environ une semaine après l'apparition des symptômes et n'ont pas besoin de soins médicaux."}

President Uhuru Kenyatta and his counterpart Mohamed Abdullahi \"Farmaajo\" spoke on Thursday, after the Kenyan leader accused Somalia of an \"unwarranted attack\" on its territory. The Kenyan president was referring to clashes between Somali government forces and its regional troops in Bula Hawa, which spilled across the border into Mandera. He warned Somalia to stop provoking Kenya by violating its territorial integrity, saying the Somali army had fought on Kenyan land, creating tension and harassing residents. A week ago, Somalia accused Kenya of meddling in its internal affairs and warned it to stop its encroachment in the border areas. Kenya denied the claims as \"baseless and invalid\". The two leaders have now agreed to work together to improve border security, and form two committees drawn from both countries to look into strengthening diplomatic and trade relations. According to a statement from Somalia's presidential team, the committees would also look into strengthening diplomatic and trade relations. Will the calm last? Dr Hassan Khannenje, the director of the the Horn International Institute of Strategic Studies in Nairobi, says while the call was an attempt to de-escalate the situation, the calm is unlikely to last. Dr Khannenje says that while the situation may calm down for now, it could blow up again at any time, especially because of the ongoing maritime boundary dispute. He also says the fundamental political issues in Somalia, including the al-Shabab question, will not be resolved any time soon. In the meantime, tension remains high along the border, with the warring troops still present. So what are the issues that have soured Somalia's relations with Kenya in recent times? The maritime dispute The two countries have been locked in a long-running dispute over sovereignty of an area in the Indian Ocean, Both countries claim the area - thought to contain large deposits of oil and gas. Kenya has argued the sea border should be drawn parallel to the line of latitude, while Somalia saying it should be extended in the same direction as its land border. The two were unable to settle the matter out of court, ultimately referring the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which Mr Mohamed insisted should be the ultimate arbiter. Kenya had favoured a negotiated settlement, arguing the court system would not address the political issues around the case. The international court is expected to rule on the maritime dispute in June. The al-Shabab threat The political and security situation in Somalia has also played a role in escalating the diplomatic row between the two countries. Somalia has experienced almost constant conflict since the collapse of its central government in 1991. The government in Mogadishu has been unable to exert muchcontrol over the regional governments, which run almost autonomously. Al-Shabab, which has links to al-Qaeda, remains active in many rural areas. Kenya is one of several countries to have deployed troops as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), which is helping the Somali government battle al-Shabab. But al-Shabab continues to carry out attacks in both the country and its neighbours, including Kenya. At least 80 people died in a bomb blast in December in Mogadishu and there have been other deadly attacks since then. The Somali government has been accused of spending too much on disputes with regional governments in Jubbaland, Puntland, South West and Galmudug, rather than tackling the threat from al-Shabab. Who does Kenya support in Somalia? Kenya backs the administration of Ahmed Mohamed Islam better known as \"Madobe\" in Jubbaland, because of its own security and regional interests. Kenya has its troops under Amisom deployed in Jubbaland together with Ethiopia, and has been keen to have the region, which stretches right along its 700km- (430 mile) border with Somalia, as a buffer zone against al-Shabab. Last year, Mr Madobe was supported by Kenya to win his election bid as the regional president, against opposition from President Mohamed and Ethiopia. The Somali government then imposed air travel restrictions between Kismayo, Jubbaland's biggest city, and Mogadishu, which badly affected business in the state, as ground transport is unsafe because of al-Shabab. Somalia's leader has a close interest in who is in power in the states, as they determine the people who pick the MPs from the state, who in turn elect the president. This may change as Mr Mohamed recently signed a historic law that paves the way for the country to hold its first one-person-one vote election in half a century, although this may not be possible in all areas because of the security situation. The wanted minister The latest clashes in Mandera come against a background of simmering tensions between the two countries. In the latest incident, Somalia accused Kenya of harbouring Jubbaland security minister Abdirashid Janan Hassan Abdinur, who is said to have escaped from a Mogadishu prison on 28 January. The regional minister, who is accused of committing grave human rights violations and killing civilians in Gedo, Somalia, had been in detention for four months awaiting trial. Amnesty International had asked Kenyan authorities to \"immediately arrest and hand him over to the Federal Government of Somalia\". Amnesty also accused the Jubbaland administration of shielding him from facing justice. \"The Jubaland administration, including President Ahmed Mohamed Islam, who has repeatedly called for Abdirashid's release from detention, must desist from shielding him from facing justice upon his return,\" it said. So this week the Somali government deployed contingents of troops from Mogadishu at the border near Mandera town in Kenya, where the minister was said to be hiding. It prompted the face-off with a militia group loyal to the minister and Jubbaland troops who were protecting him. For now, the presidential phone call seems to have de-escalated the situation. But it is far from clear whether it has resolved the many outstanding issues between the two neighbours.", "summary": "Des centaines d'habitants de Mandera, dans le nord-est du Kenya, près de la Somalie, ont fui la région à la suite des affrontements entre les troupes en guerre de l'autre côté de la frontière."}

The former South African president is - for most of the world - a symbol of triumph over oppression. But for 26 year-old Pumla he was also family. She sat down with Radio 1 Newsbeat to share memories of the man many South Africans still call Madiba - his clan name which has become used by the wider public as a term of endearment. The poem Pumla read at the memorial said, \"you are lodged in our memories, you tower over the world like a comet.\" But, as you might expect, most of her lasting memories are more low key. \"He was the man who was always reading newspapers or that we'd have lunch with with. \"I'd be having conversations with my younger cousins and he'd always be silently listening and observing. \"We always thought he pretended to have hearing problems. He would pick and choose. Sometimes you'd have to speak loudly and sometimes you'd be speaking softly and he'd just input. \"He was a disciplinarian. He was very strict.\" Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison for fighting for better rights for black people in South Africa. The apartheid system in place at the time meant they were denied many of the rights granted to the white minority there. The law ended as he became the country's first black president. His family tree is extensive - Pumla says she doesn't \"have enough fingers\" to count his great-grandchildren now. But she still gets plenty of questions: \"People would always want to know what it was like to have this great man as my grandfather.\" It's 30 years next month since Nelson Mandela was released from prison - he became president in 1994. But, today, South Africa still has more than its fair share of issues. A higher proportion of black South Africans have historically lived in poverty compared with Asian and white South Africans. In 2015, nine out of 10 people living in poverty were black. It also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. So what would Nelson Mandela make of 2020 South Africa? \"I know he wouldn't be 100% happy but I also know he predicted a lot of what is happening right now,\" says Pumla. \"He'd be unhappy with the level of unemployment, gender-based violence and the state of leadership in our country.\" It's possibly for those reasons that social media debates about Mandela's legacy often fires up. There are those in South Africa who believe Nelson Mandela negotiated a deal to end apartheid which was too favourable for white people. A lot of the debate is about owning land - the people who own private land remain largely white. Pumla's home is littered with photos of her great-grandad. There's one with him and her when she was in primary school and there's another with her family and Michelle Obama. She's missed out on some of those big moments though. \"My mum was very strict. I missed out on meeting a lot of people - like Beyonce. I will never actually forgive her for that one. \"I had school so she never wanted to take me out of school.\" As for now, Pumla has a job working for a tech start-up company in Johannesburg. \"There's a responsibility for anyone coming from any family to continue the legacy but I have enough family members already doing that which takes the pressure off me to feel like I have to do something. \"But I am doing something because it's just in my own nature. \"The family name has opened a lot of doors for me but I have to work even harder than normal as I have to prove I didn't get here just because of my surname.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
