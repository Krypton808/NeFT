Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US. 'A beautiful sight' China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as \"Pelosi's beautiful landscape\" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were \"a beautiful sight to behold\". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can \"enjoy this sight from their own windows\". Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for \"glorifying violence\" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as \"rioters showing signs of terrorism\". Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events. \"Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals,\" she says. Criticism over US applying 'double standard' Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying \"double standards\" in its response to civil unrest. \"You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted,\" said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. \"And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then.\" The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America \"the double standard nation\". Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. More from Zhaoyin Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented. \"It's powerful, because they are not making it up,\" Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests. Ms Kokas says: \"Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principle of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\" The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems \"very hollow\"，she adds, \"when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC\". Chinese diplomats condemn US racism The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader. Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted \"I can't breathe\", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong. But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included \"all lives matter\", a phrase often used to undermine the \"black lives matter\" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some \"misunderstandings\". One Weibo user expresses \"disappointment\", as the person sees \"some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted\". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. Anti-America sentiment on the rise There's no doubt US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts \"congratulate\" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations. One user writes: \"The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!\" And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a \"black hand\" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as \"karma\" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation. \"This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment,\" a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes. Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. \"Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results,\" a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being \"envious of the freedom of expression\" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication. But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a \"pro-America\" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo. Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship. Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. \"The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space,\" she says.

Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out. Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened. At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal. In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint \"no big deal\" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media. 'I tried to take her to school' Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these. On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety. Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams. \"I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter,\" said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman. \"If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister,\" he said. According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire. Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted \"to make it look like a suicide\". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died. \"One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned,\" Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali. But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone. \"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" you can hear her say. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa. News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni. Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. \"None of the culprits will be spared from legal action,\" she said. Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh. \"Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists,\" said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page. \"I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry,\" wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post. According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher. \"When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations,\" said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association. \"It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples.\" Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh? In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students. \"This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done,\" said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka. \"Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools,\" she said. \"They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment.\"", "summary": "近日，孟加拉女孩努斯拉特·贾汉·拉菲（Nusrat Jahan Rafi）在学校被浇上煤油活活烧死。而不到两周前，她曾指控校长性骚扰。"}

The free app is currently invite-only and restricted to owners of iPhones. Chinese users are paying up to $77 (£56) for invitations from e-commerce sites and bypassing China's censors, according to the FT. Clubhouse was launched in May and valued at almost $100m. The app allows users to join and participate in pop-up public or private audio chatrooms. Conversations are not recorded, which theoretically ensures privacy, although some interviews of celebrities and influencers have been secretly recorded and uploaded to YouTube. Early adopters were mostly Silicon Valley technophiles and investors, but the app's invite-only nature has created an exclusivity appeal that has seen a raft of US celebrities join, including Oprah Winfrey, Ashton Kutcher, Drake, Azealia Banks, Jared Leto and Tiffany Haddish. But the app's downloads more than doubled in the last two weeks due to popular tech moguls like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg joining Clubhouse to participate in interviews and talk shows. After Mr Musk tweeted that he would be speaking live on the app, shares in an unrelated company called Clubhouse Media shares soared. The actual app is privately owned, meaning its shares can't be bought by the public. Freedom to discuss controversial topics At the moment, Clubhouse is only available on the iPhone and can be accessed in mainland China without the use of a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass China's Great Firewall. While many of the chatrooms are either private or have been deleted, over the weekend thousands of Chinese users joined chatrooms on Clubhouse in order to freely discuss topics that are considered to be taboo in China, from the Hong Kong protests and the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, to heightening tensions between China and Taiwan. Multiple Chinese users who witnessed the audio conversations in the app's chatrooms took to Twitter to discuss what they were seeing. It is unlikely that the Chinese government will continue to permit access to Clubhouse for long, however. Monetising Clubhouse Although Clubhouse is currently invite-only, it is already offering a wide range of audio-based activities, including live DJ sets, celebrity talk shows and even speed dating. While none of this is yet monetised, Clubhouse has plans to turn popular users into influencers, according to the New York Times. More than 40 Clubhouse influencers have been invited to a \"Creator Pilot Program\" where they will attend regular meetings with the app's founders and be given special access to new tools. But the app has also been criticised for a lack of moderation. A December article by Vulture declared that Clubhouse was \"dangerously close\" to becoming a \"new Internet wasteland\", because conversations can easily veer off-topic from their intended subject matter and debates can turn into attacks - even against celebrities - if the moderators of the chatrooms are not careful. \"It remains to be seen whether opening to the public will upend the precarious balance between chaos and chill that the young app currently enjoys; [or] whether the many celebrity regulars will stick when the exclusivity wears off and anyone can log in and call them out for takes that aren't necessarily very deeply considered,\" wrote Craig Jenkins. \"Most important, [it remains to be seen] whether or not we're only interested in an audio app that is, on a certain level, replicating the experience of meeting strangers on '90s chat lines primarily because we're all stranded at home and lonely.\"", "summary": "音频社交应用程式Clubhouse的新用户数量在上周快速增长，其中很多是蜂拥而至讨论政治议题的中国人。不过，来自中国多个城市的用户周一（2月8日）报告说，当局已经屏蔽了这一软件。"}

Doctors say three-person IVF could eliminate debilitating and potentially fatal diseases that are passed from mother to child. Opponents say it is unethical and could set the UK on a \"slippery slope\" to designer babies. Using the parents' sperm and eggs plus an additional egg from a donor woman should prevent mitochondrial disease. Mitochondria are the tiny, biological \"power stations\" that provide energy to nearly every cell of the body. One in every 6,500 babies has severe mitochondrial disease leaving them lacking energy, resulting in muscle weakness, blindness, heart failure and even death. As mitochondria are passed down from mother to child, using an extra egg from a donor woman could give the child healthy mitochondria. However, it would also result in babies having DNA from two parents and a tiny amount from the donor as mitochondria have their own DNA. Scientists have devised two techniques that allow them to take the genetic information from the mother and place it into the egg of a donor with healthy mitochondria. The Department of Health has already backed the technique and says this consultation is not about whether it should be allowed, but how it is implemented. The regulatory body, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, will have to decide in each cases that there is a \"significant risk\" of disability or serious illness. It is anticipated that only the most severely affected women - perhaps 10 cases per year - would go ahead. The regulations suggest treating the donor woman in the same manner as an organ donor. Any resulting children will not be able to discover the identity of the donor, which is the case with other sperm and egg donors. Prof Doug Turnbull, who has pioneered research in mitochondrial donation at Newcastle University, said: \"I am delighted that the government has published the draft regulations. \"This is very good news for patients with mitochondrial DNA disease and an important step in the prevention of transmission of serious mitochondrial disease.\" The chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said: \"Allowing mitochondrial donation would give women who carry severe mitochondrial disease the opportunity to have children without passing on devastating genetic disorders. \"It would also keep the UK at the forefront of scientific development in this area. \"I want to encourage contributions to this consultation so that we have as many views as possible before introducing our final regulations.\" Dr David King, the director of Human Genetics Alert, said this was a decision of \"major historical significance\" which had not been debated adequately. \"If passed, this will be the first time any government has legalised inheritable human genome modification, something that is banned in all other European countries. \"The techniques have not passed the necessary safety tests so it is unnecessary and premature to rush ahead with legalisation. \"The techniques are unethical according to basic medical ethics, since their only advantage over standard and safe egg donation is that the mother is genetically related to her child. \"This cannot justify the unknown risks to the child or the social consequences of allowing human genome modification.\"", "summary": "英国宣布了有关如何使用来自三个人的精子和卵子人工生育婴儿的规范。"}

British aircraft had flown a \"huge number\" of missions \"second only to the United States, five times as many as France\", Mr Fallon told the newspaper. \"Our role now, apart from the air strikes, is increasingly going to be on training,\" he said. \"In particular, it will mean dealing with car and truck bombs and roadside devices, as well as basic infantry skills. \"We have not finalised numbers yet - obviously we have got a lot of kit back from Afghanistan that we can make available - but we are talking very low hundreds.\" 'Rooted out' British troops would be able to pass on the \"lessons we have learnt from Afghanistan\", Mr Fallon added. He said IS fighters were increasingly now \"tucked away in towns and villages\" as a result of air strikes. \"That means they have got to be rooted out by ground troops. This has to be done by an own-grown army, not by western groups.\" He stressed that the US training centres - one based in Kurdistan and three near the Iraqi capital Baghdad - were \"not where the fighting is\". \"They are in safe areas but obviously there's always a small element of force protection.\" The soldiers \"will not be expected to fight a war but will be there to defend the British personnel if necessary\", he added. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said Labour supported the steps taken to assist Iraq's government in responding to IS. \"It is right that the UK's armed forces continue to provide training and equipment in support of this effort,\" he added. \"The government should provide clarity about the scale, scope and timeframe of the deployment of these further trainers. \"The defence secretary should clearly outline the numbers of military trainers involved and the work that they will be doing, so that there can be no misunderstanding about the role of British troops in Iraq.\" US training Large swathes of Syria and Iraq are currently under the control of IS extremists. Pressure to provide more support to new Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi to reclaim territory in the north and west has been growing. The US has agreed to send around 500 soldiers to Iraq and elsewhere in the region, with the aim of retraining the Iraqi army.

He was found guilty last week of misconduct in public office, in a case related to a luxury flat in China. In sentencing, Judge Andrew Chan said: \"Never in my judicial career have I seen a man fall from so high.\" A number of senior former officials in Hong Kong had written letters to the court in defence of Tsang's character. The judge said he took Tsang's reputation and long public service into account in sentencing, taking 10 months off what would have been a 30-month sentence. The maximum penalty could have been seven years. Tsang was cleared last week of a second count of misconduct, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on a third charge of accepting an advantage. He is expected to be retried on that charge in September. After sentencing, he was taken from court in handcuffs to the hospital where he has been staying since experiencing chest pain on Monday. The view from the gallery: The BBC's Juliana Liu in court When the presiding judge asked Mr Tsang to stand for sentencing, the former chief executive took a sip of water and closed his eyes. He kept his eyes closed during most of the sentencing speech and appeared to calm himself with a rhythmic breathing exercise. Five years of investigations and weeks of trial had culminated in this humiliating moment. It was an ignominious end for a man who used to be the pride of Hong Kong - someone who had overcome a humble start in life to hold three of the city's top jobs. Mr Tsang's legacy and reputation are in tatters and the judge acknowledged it, saying he had never before seen a man fall so far, so fast. Designer flat The case has worried a territory that prides itself on its relatively clean reputation. The trial related to events which took place near the end of his term, between 2010 and 2012. Prosecutors accused Mr Tsang of inappropriate and undeclared conflicts of interest, including renting a luxury flat in mainland China from the shareholder of a broadcast company whose licence applications he approved. They also alleged the flat was redecorated free of charge and that he later nominated the interior designer for an honour. The jury found him guilty of misconduct over his failure to disclose the lease of the flat, but dismissed the charge related to the designer and did not reach a verdict on whether he accepted a bribe in the form of the refurbishment. A career civil servant, Tsang rose through the ranks to become Hong Kong's second chief executive, following Tung Chee-hwa. His deputy, former Chief Secretary Rafael Hui, was jailed for accepting bribes from a property tycoon in 2014.", "summary": "香港前特首曾荫权因公职人员行为失当罪成而被判监20个月，现时还押赤柱监狱。"}

Apple said revenue for the next quarter would be between $50bn (£34bn; €46bn) and $53bn, below the $58bn it reported for the same period a year ago. This would mark Apple's first fall in revenues since it launched the iPhone. Despite first-quarter iPhone sales being below the 75 million expected by analysts, it was still a record quarter for the company. Apple revenue in the three months to 26 December was $75.9bn and net profit was $18.4bn, both of which are the highest ever recorded by the company. Sales of iPhones accounted for 68% of the company's revenue in the period. Analysis By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Any other company announcing record profits and revenues might expect a warm welcome from investors. But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns. Sales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more, the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch. Then there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow. Of course, the worries about \"peak iPhone\" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September. But the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running. The Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product. Perhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience. Is the mighty iPhone in decline? Chinese 'softness not seen before' Apple boss Tim Cook credited \"all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV\" for the performance. But the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in \"a very difficult macroeconomic environment\". He added that \"iPhone units will decline in the quarter\" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months. Mr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago. Mr Maestri said the softness in China was \"something that we have not seen before\", Reuters reported. 'Mother of all balance sheets' China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. The profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%. Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was \"generating industry defying margins\" and had cash of almost $216bn. Speaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had \"the mother of all balance sheets\" and that its financial position had never been stronger. Apple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the \"white knuckles fears\" ahead of the results, he would \"characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared\".", "summary": "苹果公司星期二（1月26日）报告说，苹果公司的iPhone销售量出现了自2007年推出这项产品以来的最低增长。"}

On Wednesday the Trump administration ordered the closure of China's mission in Houston, saying it was involved in stealing intellectual property. China condemned moves against its scientists and consulates in the US. Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accused the administration of using excuses to limit, harass or crack down on Chinese scholars in the country. \"In response to the US's unreasonable actions, China must make a necessary response and safeguard its legitimate rights,\" he said at a press conference, describing the US allegations as \"malicious slander\". Following the row over the Houston consulate, President Donald Trump threatened to close down more Chinese missions. In recent months he has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over trade, the coronavirus pandemic and China's imposition of a controversial new security law on Hong Kong. What are the allegations about the San Francisco mission? Court filings by prosecutors in a federal court in San Francisco say the defendant, named as Juan Tang, was a biology researcher at the University of California, Davis. According to the filings, during an interview with FBI agents last month she said she had not served in the Chinese military. However, the document says, an open-source investigation uncovered photos of her wearing military uniform and a search of her home found further evidence of her affiliation with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). \"At some point following the search and interview of Tang on June 20, 2020, Tang went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where the FBI assesses she has remained,\" the filing, first reported on by the Axios news site, reads. It adds: \"As the Tang case demonstrates, the Chinese consulate in San Francisco provides a potential safe harbor for a PLA official intent on avoiding prosecution in the United States.\" Prosecutors say that this is not an isolated case but \"appears to be part of a program conducted by the PLA\" to send military scientists to the US on false pretences. The document also highlights the cases of two other researchers arrested in California in recent weeks for lying about their alleged ties to the military. What is happening at China's consulates? The Houston consulate came under scrutiny on Tuesday when people overlooking the building's courtyard noticed several bins on fire. Footage showed people throwing what appeared to be paper into the bins. Emergency services were called to the building but Houston police say they were not granted access. On Wednesday, the administration gave China 72 hours to close the consulate \"to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information\". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: \"We are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave. And when they don't, we're going to take actions that protect the American people, protect... our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs.\" The consulate is one of five in the US, not counting the embassy in Washington.

This enabled a new generation of bright, energy-efficient white lamps, as well as colour LED screens. The winners will share prize money of eight million kronor (£0.7m). They were named at a press conference in Sweden, and join a prestigious list of 196 other Physics laureates recognised since 1901. Prof Nakamura, who was woken up in Japan to receive the news, told the press conference, \"It's unbelievable.\" Making the announcement, the Nobel jury emphasised the usefulness of the invention, adding that the Nobel Prizes were established to recognise developments that delivered \"the greatest benefit to mankind\". \"These uses are what would make Alfred Nobel very happy,\" said Prof Olle Inganas, a member of the prize committee from Linkoping University. The committee chair, Prof Per Delsing, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, emphasised the winners' dedication. \"What's fascinating is that a lot of big companies really tried to do this and they failed,\" he said. \"But these guys persisted and they tried and tried again - and eventually they actually succeeded.\" Although red and green LEDs had been around for many years, blue LEDs were a long-standing challenge for scientists in both academia and industry. Without them, the three colours could not be mixed to produce the white light we now see in LED-based computer and TV screens. Furthermore, the high-energy blue light could be used to excite phosphorus and directly produce white light - the basis of the next generation of light bulb. Today, blue LEDs are found in people's pockets around the world, inside the lights and screens of smartphones. White LED lamps, meanwhile, deliver light to many offices and households. They use much less energy than both incandescent and fluorescent lamps. That improvement arises because LEDs convert electricity directly into photons of light, instead of the wasteful mixture of heat and light generated inside traditional, incandescent bulbs. Those bulbs use current to heat a wire filament until it glows, while the gas discharge inside fluorescent lamps also produces both heat and light. Inside an LED, current is applied to a sandwich of semiconductor materials, which emit a particular wavelength of light depending on the chemical make-up of those materials. Gallium nitride was the key ingredient used by the Nobel laureates in their ground-breaking blue LEDs. Growing big enough crystals of this compound was the stumbling block that stopped many other researchers - but Profs Akasaki and Amano, working at Nagoya University in Japan, managed to grow them in 1986 on a specially-designed scaffold made partly from sapphire. Four years later Prof Nakamura made a similar breakthrough, while he was working at the chemical company Nichia. Instead of a special substrate, he used a clever manipulation of temperature to boost the growth of the all-important crystals. Previous winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 - Francois Englert and Peter Higgs shared the prize for formulating the theory of the Higgs boson particle. 2012 - Serge Haroche and David J Wineland were awarded the prize for their work with light and matter. 2011 - The discovery that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating earned Saul Perlmutter, Brian P Schmidt and Adam Riess the physics prize. 2010 - Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the prize for their discovery of the \"wonder material\" graphene. 2009 - Charles Kuen Kao won the physics Nobel for helping to develop fibre optic cables. In its award citation, the Nobel committee declared: \"Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th Century; the 21st Century will be lit by LED lamps.\" Commenting on the news, the president of the Institute of Physics, Dr Frances Saunders, emphasised that energy-efficient lamps form an important part of the effort to help slow carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. \"With 20% of the world's electricity used for lighting, it's been calculated that optimal use of LED lighting could reduce this to 4%,\" she said. \"Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura's research has made this possible. This is physics research that is having a direct impact on the grandest of scales, helping protect our environment, as well as turning up in our everyday electronic gadgets.\" LED lamps have the potential to help more than 1.5 billion people around the world who do not have access to electricity grids - because they are efficient enough to run on cheap, local solar power. At the University of Cambridge in the UK, Professor Sir Colin Humphreys also works on gallium nitride technology, including efforts to produce the crystals more cheaply and reduce the cost of LED lamps. He told BBC News he was thrilled by the Nobel announcement. \"It pleases me greatly, because this is good science but it's also useful science. It's making a huge difference to energy savings. And I think some of the Nobel Prizes we have had recently - it will be years, if ever, before that science is usefully applied.\" Professor Ian Walmsley, a physicist at Oxford University, said the jury had made a \"fantastic choice\". \"The ideas derive from some very important underpinning science developed over many years,\" he said, adding that the technology \"makes new devices possible that are having, and will have, a huge impact on society, especially in displays and imaging\".

I wondered idly if I could whip up a vending machine surf and turf, and whether it would be any good. There was only one way to find out. I opted for sliced sashimi-style salmon and an Australian Wagyu striploin. The nearest salad vending machine was in the next neighbourhood. So I put off vegetables for another day. Pizza, cacti and anything else Vending machines are having a moment in Singapore. It's not just Wagyu beef and salmon. Machines offer bread, curry puffs, freshly cooked pizza, freshly squeezed orange juice and even cooked chilli crab, a famously messy local favourite that costs $60 (£33). Drinks and snacks still dominate, but the variety is increasing. One company has set up a chain of cafes that serve hot local dishes from machines. There's also a small chain of unstaffed convenience stores, selling everything from plasters to baked beans out of machines. One local retailer has a book vending machine, while another company sells cacti. Market research firm Euromonitor says vending machine revenues in Singapore grew about 15% from $91m in 2014 to $104.5m in 2019. Last year was tipped to be a bad one due to the pandemic, but growth is expected to resume this year. Why Singapore? The reasons vending entrepreneurs are trying out new products are as varied as the businesses themselves. Manish Kumar, the managing director of Norwegian Salmon, says machines offer him his own retail space. That means his frozen products aren't placed next to fresh salmon, which is more popular here. Mervin Tham, one of the three founders of EasyMeat, whose machines sell the Wagyu beef, thinks the variety is expanding because the barriers to entry are fairly low. \"It's a low effort way of testing a product, especially if you're starting a business of your own. And generally there's some interest towards the automated retail culture that you see overseas, like in Japan,\" he says. Elaborate prank or popular meal? The Norwegian Salmon ATM dispensed my sliced sashimi, which was frozen in a vacuum-sealed pack with a packet of soy sauce and a small wooden fork. It's such an oddly specific product that when the machines started to appear around Singapore I wondered if it might be an elaborate prank or a weird art project. \"A lot of people have told me that,\" says Mr Kumar. Still, he says locals are coming around to the idea. Currently, there are 110 machines, and he thinks there are enough customers in Singapore to support 900. And the more machines, the better. Most operate on slim margins, which means decent profits depend on having many machines and enough people to buy from them. Mr Kumar says a compact, densely populated city like Singapore is ideal. Pandemic ready? In Japan, which has more machines per capita than any other country, the pandemic has hit the industry hard, mostly because of reduced foot traffic. Euromonitor's report also predicted a significant drop for Singapore's machines. But vending machines have played a key role in Singapore's pandemic response, with the charitable arm of the country's sovereign wealth fund Temasek installing 1,200 of them around the island to dispense free masks. Mr Kumar says his own machines did well, with sales surging elevenfold during Singapore's circuit breaker period, which restricted movement between April and June last year. \"It's 24/7, contactless, safe to buy, safe to eat. No need to go to any superstore. Social distancing is there. In six seconds, you get your product. You go,\" he says. Cost and convenience It took me 30 minutes on a bus to get to the Wagyu vending machine, so the sign on the side of the machine saying \"Wagyu near you\" wasn't strictly true. But EasyMeat is a new company with only a few machines, and the firm's founders have plans to expand. In a city where almost everything can be delivered, they are keenly aware that convenience is always a key selling point. Co-founder Mervin Tham says they started the business partly because they had all separately wanted sliced Wagyu beef for shabu shabu hot pot dishes after midnight, and had been unable to get it. \"Sometimes when the weather is cold, in Asian cultures you do like to have steamboats or hot pots. And sometimes you find yourself not having Wagyu when you want it,\" Mr Tham says. He says there is a gap between bricks and mortar and e-commerce. If the supermarket is closed, the obvious alternative is to order it online. But it often takes several days to arrive, the customer might have to wait at home for several hours to receive a frozen delivery and there might be a minimum order. A vending machine solves these problems. Wagyu beef seems like an unusual impulse buy, but Mr Tham says the machines' data shows that many customers buy after midnight. \"I have no idea who are the night owls that would camp out that late for supper,\" he says. Surf and turf The salmon and the steak both came out of the vending machine frozen solid in vacuum-sealed containers, so I let them thaw out on the ride home, and then for another few hours once I reached my kitchen. The salmon didn't require any preparation beyond taking it out of the packaging. But I had to cook the $24 Wagyu on the stove-top, a slightly daunting prospect for a culinary bungler like me. So I opted for the simplest possible approach: lightly seasoned and cooked in a pan with some oil. The surf and turf scored 7.5 out of 10, which is better than I expected. The salmon was flavourful, although I would have liked some wasabi with it. The steak was tender, fatty and very tasty. I cooked it a touch too long and my presentation was sloppy at best. But I can hardly blame a machine for that.", "summary": "新加坡高文（Kovan）附近的购物中心看上去有些冷清，似乎不太适合购买新鲜的鲑鱼、和牛。"}

It will serve as a hub for 200 giant offshore wind turbines. It is the biggest construction project in Danish history, costing an estimated 210bn kroner (£24bn; €28bn: $34bn). Situated 80km (50 miles) out to sea, the artificial island would be at least half-owned by the state but partly by the private sector. It will not just supply electricity for Danes but for other, neighbouring countries' electricity grids too. Although those countries have not yet been detailed, Prof Jacob Ostergaard of the Technical University of Denmark told the BBC that the UK could benefit, as well as Germany or the Netherlands. Green hydrogen would also be provided for use in shipping, aviation, industry and heavy transport. Under Denmark's Climate Act, the country has committed to an ambitious 70% reduction in 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to becoming CO2 neutral by 2050. Last December it announced it was ending all new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said the country was simply \"changing the map\". \"This is gigantic,\" Prof Ostergaard told the BBC. \"It's the next big step for the Danish wind turbine industry. We were leading on land, then we took the step offshore and now we are taking the step with energy islands, so it'll keep the Danish industry in a pioneering position.\" Green group Dansk Energi said that while the \"dream was on the way to becoming a reality\" it doubted the North Sea island would be up and running by the planned 2033 start date. But Danish politicians across the spectrum have given their backing to the plan. Former energy minister Rasmus Helveg Petersen of the Social Liberal party said energy islands had begun \"as a radical vision\" but there was now a broad agreement to turn it into a reality. A smaller energy island is already being planned off Bornholm in the Baltic Sea, to the east of mainland Denmark. Agreements have already been signed for electricity to be provided from there to Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Last November the European Union announced plans for a 25-fold increase in offshore wind capacity by 2050, with a five-fold increase by 2030. Renewable energy provides around a third of the bloc's current electricity needs: While there is some secrecy over where the new island will be built, it is known that it will be 80km into the North Sea. Danish TV said that a Danish Energy Agency study last year had marked two areas west of the Jutland coast and that both had a relatively shallow sea depth of 26-27m.

The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. One tablet per pupil Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. \"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said. Internet addicts A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\". The benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. \"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.", "summary": "由英国教育技术慈善机构“Tablets for Schools”主持的一项调查显示，英国近70%的中小学都已经使用了平板电脑。"}

Analysis: Expectations high for 10th anniversary iPhone By Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This is always the least impressive time of year for Apple's earnings, coming as it does after the Christmas period. But worse-than-expected iPhone sales had investors slightly unhappy after anticipation of strong earnings sent shares to record highs earlier on Tuesday. Tim Cook told investors he was also pleased with the continued growth of its Services division - that's things like Apple Music, Apple TV, iTunes and so on - but the health of Apple is only realistically measured with the success of that all-conquering smartphone. Which is why the rest of the year will be exciting to watch. With the iPhone's 10th anniversary upon us, expectations are high for the next device. Anything short of a major improvement would be troubling for investors who are banking on the next iPhone being a blockbuster, not an incremental upgrade. Analysts at GlobalData Retail noted that Apple's revenue from iPhones was $7bn less than the same period two years ago. \"We highlight these facts not to be unduly harsh to Apple, but to indicate that the company has only partially emerged from the slump that hit it over the last fiscal year,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note. \"In our view, the company's mature product line up and an absence of any significant new devices mean it has struggled to regain all of the lost ground,\" he added. China, which was partly to blame for the slowdown last year, was again difficult for Apple. Revenue from China dropped 14%, although Mr Cook partly blamed currency fluctuations for the fall. Tim Coulling, senior analyst at Canalys, said the Chinese smartphone market was highly competitive, with cheaper products that matched Apple in terms of specification. He said it was \"difficult to come up with something truly revolutionary\", but he expected their new device to have a bigger screen. Apple said quarterly profits were $11bn worldwide, up 4.9% from the same period in 2016. The firm also announced it would return an extra $50bn to shareholders. Apple's cash holdings have risen to a record $256.8bn and the company has come under increasing pressure to disclose its plans for the money.", "summary": "苹果公司2017年头三个月售出5080万支iPhone，销售量较去年同期相比下跌1%。"}

Q-W-E-R-T-Y. There's a lesson here: it matters where the keys sit on your keyboard. There are good arrangements and bad ones. Many people think that qwerty is a bad one - in fact, that it was deliberately designed to be slow and awkward. Could that be true? And why do economists, of all people, argue about this? It turns out that the stakes are higher than they might first appear. Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. But let's start by figuring out why anyone might have been perverse enough to want to slow down typists. In the early 1980s, I persuaded my mother Deb to let me use her mechanical typewriter, a miraculous contraption which would transcend my awful handwriting. When I hit a key, a lever would flick up from behind the keyboard and whack hard against an inked ribbon, squeezing that ink against a sheet of paper. On the end of the lever - called a type bar - would be a pair of reversed letters in relief. I discovered that if I hit several keys at once, the type bars all flew up at the same time into the same spot. Fun for a nine-year-old boy, less so for a professional typist. Typing at 60 words per minute (wpm) - no stretch for a good typist - means five or six letters striking the same spot each second. At such a speed, the typist might need to be slowed down for the sake of the typewriter. That is what qwerty supposedly did. Then again, if qwerty really was designed to be slow, how come the most popular pair of letters in English, T-H, are adjacent and right under the index fingers? The plot thickens. The father of the qwerty keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Wisconsin who sold his first typewriter in 1868 to Porter's Telegraph College, Chicago. That bit's important. The qwerty layout was designed for the convenience of telegraph operators transcribing Morse code - that's why, for example, the Z is next to the S and the E, because Z and SE are indistinguishable in American Morse code. The telegraph receiver would hover over those letters, waiting for context to make everything clear. So the qwerty keyboard wasn't designed to be slow. But it wasn't designed for the convenience of you and me, either. So why do we still use it? The simple answer is that qwerty won a battle for dominance in the 1880s. Sholes' design was taken up by the gunsmiths E Remington and Sons. They finalised the layout and put it on the market for $125 - perhaps $3,000 (£2,271) in today's money, many months' income for the secretaries who would have used it. It wasn't the only typewriter around - Sholes has been described as the \"52nd man to invent the typewriter\" - but the qwerty keyboard emerged victorious. The Remington company cannily provided qwerty typing courses, and when it merged with four major rivals in 1893, they all adopted what became known as \"the universal layout\". And this brief struggle for market dominance in 1880s America determines the keyboard layout on today's iPads. Nobody then was thinking about our interests - but their actions control ours. And that's a shame, because more logical layouts exist: notably the Dvorak, designed by August Dvorak and patented in 1932. It favours the dominant hand (left and right-hand layouts are available) and puts the most-used keys together. The US Navy conducted a study in the 1940s demonstrating that the Dvorak was vastly superior: training typists to use the Dvorak layout would pay for itself many times over. So why didn't we all switch to Dvorak? The problem lay in co-ordinating the switch. Qwerty had been the universal layout since before Dvorak was born. Most typists trained on it. Any employer investing in a costly typewriter would naturally choose the layout that most typists could use, especially when economies of scale made it the cheapest model on the market. Dvorak keyboards never stood a chance. So now we start to see why this case matters. Many economists argue qwerty is the quintessential example of something they call \"lock in\". This isn't really about typewriters. It's about Microsoft Office and Windows, Amazon's control of the online retail link between online buyers and sellers, and Facebook's dominance of social media. More things that made the modern economy: How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What leaded petrol says about the limits of regulation? How the plough changed everything How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world If all your friends are on Facebook apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, doesn't that lock you in as surely as a qwerty typist? This matters. The lock-in is the friend of monopolists, the enemy of competition, and may require a robust response from regulators. But maybe dominant standards are dominant not because of lock-in, but just because the alternatives simply aren't as compelling as we imagine. Consider the famous Navy study that demonstrated the superiority of the Dvorak keyboard. Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, unearthed that study, and concluded it was badly flawed. They also raised an eyebrow at the name of the man who supervised it - the Navy's leading time-and-motion expert, one Lieutenant-Commander… August Dvorak. Liebowitz and Margolis don't deny that the Dvorak design may be better: the world's fastest alphanumeric typists do use Dvorak's layout. In 2008, Barbara Bradford was recorded maintaining a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm) for 50 minutes, and reached a top speed of 212 wpm using such a keyboard. But they were just not convinced that this was ever an example where an entire society was desperate to switch to a hugely superior standard yet unable to co-ordinate. And in fact these days, most of us peck away at our own emails, on devices which can actually let you switch your keyboard layout. Windows, iOS and Android all offer Dvorak layouts. You no longer need to persuade your co-workers, other employers and secretarial schools to switch with you. If you want it, you can just use it. Nobody else is even going to notice. Yet most of us stick with qwerty. The door is no longer locked, but we can't be bothered to escape. Lock-in seems to be entrenching the position of some of the most powerful and valuable companies in the world today - including Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Maybe those locks are as unbreakable as the qwerty standard once seemed. Or maybe they risk being crow-barred off if restless consumers are tempted by something better. After all, it wasn't that long ago that people worried about users being locked in to MySpace.

Researchers suggest girls are better behaved in class and this influences how teachers perceive their work. Differences in school results can sometimes \"have little to do with ability\", says the study. The OECD study, examining gender inequality in education, says that girls can be put off careers in science because of a lack of self-confidence and negative stereotypes. 'Disengaged' But it also reveals that teachers can be biased towards giving girls higher results than boys, even when they have produced the same quality of work. The researchers suggest that this reflects expectations about girls being positive towards learning and less disruptive. In contrast, boys are more likely to be hostile towards school and likely to do fewer hours of homework, says the OECD study. \"From a young age, boys are less likely to raise their hand in class to ask to speak, they are worse at waiting their turn to speak or engage in an activity, they are less likely to listen and pay attention before starting a project,\" says the study. And as they get older, boys are more likely to \"start withdrawing in class and becoming disengaged\". When it comes to teachers' marking, the study says there is a consistent pattern of girls' work being \"marked up\". It suggests that \"teachers hold stereotypical ideas about boys' and girls' academic strengths and weaknesses\". Teachers are said to reward \"organisational skills, good behaviour and compliance\" rather than objectively marking pupils' work. The findings suggested that teachers needed to be aware of \"gender bias\". It also raised questions about whether this really benefited girls. \"Is it a good thing? Maybe in the short run, you get a better school certificate,\" said the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher. \"In the long run, the world is going to penalise you because the labour market doesn't pay you for your school marks, it pays you for what you can do.\" The report also showed that in science and maths, girls often underestimated their own ability. Even when they were as good or better than boys in these subjects, they still lacked the self-confidence to pursue careers in science and technology.", "summary": "一项国际调查发现，老师在给学生评分的时候，对女生更为宽容客气。"}

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. Civilian air space is expected to be opened up to all kinds of drones in the US by 2015 and in Europe by 2016.

To deliver goods to people's homes for example in residential areas, the UAVs must overfly densely populated towns and cities, something that today's regulations prevent. \"Other things to consider are security of the goods during the transit. With no one to guard them the aircraft and package could be captured and stolen,\" he said. Amazon said: \"from a technology point of view, we'll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place.\" The FAA was \"actively working on rules for unmanned aerial vehicles\", the company said, adding that it hoped the green light would be given as early as 2015. \"One day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today.\" Zookal, an Australian textbook rental company, announced earlier this year that it would start using drones to make deliveries from 2015 if approved by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

US media quote sources saying it relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China. Hunter Biden said he was confident he would be shown to have done no wrong. The Biden-Harris transition team said the president-elect was \"deeply proud of his son\". A statement from the team said Hunter had \"fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger\". The 50-year-old said he had learned of the investigation on Tuesday. He did not disclose any further details. \"I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisers,\" he said. Reports say the investigation was begun in 2018, before Joe Biden announced his bid for the presidency. Hunter Biden was a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, focusing on his business dealings in Ukraine and China when Joe Biden was vice-president in the Barack Obama administration. Last December, President Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-run House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. But Mr Trump was cleared by the Republican-held Senate in February. The new investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs comes as his father assembles his cabinet. If the case is still ongoing when Mr Biden is sworn into office next month, his pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation, AP notes. The spotlight stays on Hunter The presidential election is over, but it seems President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter - a regular target of Republican attacks during the campaign - is going to stay in the news. The revelation that Hunter is under tax investigation is not entirely surprising. There have been hints of such an inquiry for months. With official confirmation, however, comes further scrutiny - and potential political headaches for the president-elect. If Republicans maintain control of the US Senate, hearings into Hunter's finances - and any ties to President Biden - are a foregone conclusion. And if the investigation turns into formal charges, political concerns for the Biden family could turn into very real legal ones. While Donald Trump's critics will be quick to accuse the outgoing president of orchestrating this investigation as political reprisal, the US attorney behind it - David Weiss of Delaware - is a veteran prosecutor. Although he was appointed by the current president, Weiss also worked as a deputy in the office, and as interim US attorney, during Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. Hunter Biden, in a statement, says he acted \"legally and appropriately\". If so, this matter will eventually fade from view.

The ruling paves the way for more than 250 people, including 37 babies, to be deported to a detention camp on the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru. PM Malcolm Turnbull said the borders had to be secure, and repeated the view that the policy prevents deaths. \"Our commitment today is simply this: the people smugglers will not prevail over our sovereignty. Our borders are secure. The line has to be drawn somewhere and it is drawn at our border,\" he said. Rights groups have reported harsh conditions, violence and abuses at the camps, while Australian senators have said Nauru is not safe for children. Analysis: Jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney This is a significant victory for Australia's conservative government and its tough stance towards asylum seekers. For several years now Australia has effectively outsourced its asylum seeker problem, paying hundreds of millions of dollars to both Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house offshore detention centres. The court ruling judged that to be legal. Human rights groups say the ruling will mean more than 200 asylum seekers who came to Australia to seek medical treatment, including 37 babies born here as well as around 50 children, will be forced to leave and return to Nauru. There has been particular controversy around the case of a five-year-old boy who was allegedly raped while being detained in Nauru but who could now be forced to go back. The government says it will seek medical advice before making a decision regarding the boy. Despite widespread criticism internationally towards Australia's treatment of asylum seekers, polls show the policies which have stopped asylum seekers trying to reach Australia's shores are broadly popular here with the public. The High Court case was brought by an unnamed Bangladeshi woman who was held on Nauru after trying to enter Australia illegally by boat. She was later taken to Australia while pregnant for medical treatment and gave birth there. In what was seen as a test case for other detainees, she then tried to stop the government sending her back to Nauru. The Human Rights Law Centre spent nine months arguing that Australia had broken the law by sending her there. But the court rejected this in a six-to-one ruling, but it did stress that people cannot legally be held in camps indefinitely. About 500 migrants are currently living on Nauru, 3,000 km (1,800 miles) northeast of Australia. The ruling has immediate implications for 267 other people also taken to Australia from the camps for medical treatment, including 37 babies born in Australia. They are now expected to be deported. Human rights lawyer Claire Hammerton told the BBC the evidence of extreme mental health problems suffered by children in Nauru was compelling, but that the ruling was the last chance to challenge it. \"Children in detention in Australia who are slated to be transferred to Nauru consistently tell us they are living with daily fear and anxiety about being sent there. These children they don't understand why they are being treated like criminals,\" she said. Speaking in parliament after the ruling, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull defended the controversial border security arrangements, saying they were necessary to deter and prevent people smuggling. Meanwhile the Australian arm of UN's children fund Unicef said the ruling had \"no bearing in Australia's moral responsibility or its obligations to protect the rights of children\". Unicef said it was \"unreasonable\" for Australia to \"shift responsibility\" to a developing country. Australia intercepts all boats bringing suspected asylum seekers to its territory and takes those on board to Nauru or to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Even if they are found to be genuine refugees they will not be allowed to settle in Australia. The government says the policy deters people smuggling and saves lives at sea, but it has been widely criticised as breaking Australia's legal obligations.", "summary": "澳大利亚高等法院星期三（2月3日）裁决，称政府将难民庇护申请者羁押在海外设立的难民羁押中心的政策合法。"}

While the proposal would only apply to public hospitals, private hospitals have also agreed to follow suit. Increasing \"birth tourism\" from the mainland has caused tensions. Soaring numbers of mainland women have sought to give birth in Hong Kong to ensure that their child receives Hong Kong citizenship. Almost half of all babies born in Hong Kong in 2010 were the children of mainland couples, according to government figures. The \"zero quota\" proposals were made by Chief Executive-elect CY Leung, who takes office on 1 July. Under the proposals, pregnant women from mainland China will not be eligible for obstetrics services from next year, unless their husband is from Hong Kong. Furthermore, children born to mainland parents will not be guaranteed residency unless one of their parents is a Hong Kong resident. The new proposals are likely to be popular in Hong Kong, whose residents have said that \"birth tourism\" from mainland China has strained resources and put lives at risk. 'No choice' Ethnic Chinese babies born in Hong Kong currently automatically receive the right to live and work there, as well as the right to carry a Hong Kong passport, which makes international travel easier. Some mainlanders also choose to give birth in Hong Kong to skirt the one-child policy, which can result in heavy fines for violators. Mr Leung, who was elected with the weakest mandate of any chief executive to date, has been trying to rally political support with populist policies, says the BBC's Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu.

Alan Lau, head of Hong Kong's Private Hospitals Association, told the BBC that its members felt they had no choice but to comply with Mr Leung's wishes.

The organisation is urging governments to consider taxes on the super-rich. Oxfam's report comes as global leaders gather virtually for the World Economic Forum's \"Davos Dialogue\" meeting. In December 2020, the total wealth of billionaires worldwide hit $11.95tn - equivalent to the recovery spending of all the G20 governments put together, according to the charity. The 10 richest people, whose fortunes rose by $540bn since March 2020, include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Oxfam claims that the billionaires' fortunes rose due to rebounding stock markets and a \"rigged economy\", causing rising inequality during the \"worst economic downturn in a century\". Many tech giants saw sales - and share prices - rise in 2020, as lockdowns led to a jump in demand for digital services. This inflated the wealth of men like Mr Bezos, whose giant fortunes are driven by the value of holdings such as property and the shares they own, rather than wages. However, \"wealth\" does not equal income. Wealth estimates refer to the net worth of an individual, including their money, the value of their assets and also the \"notional\" value of the shares they hold. A rise in share prices pertains to the perceived net worth of a company as a whole, rather than the shareholders themselves. Living in poverty The report said that Mr Bezos's worth had climbed so much between March-September 2020 that he could have given all 876,000 Amazon employees a $105,000 bonus and still have been as wealthy as he was before the pandemic. This compares with the world's poorest, for whom economic recovery could take more than a decade. Oxfam estimates that between 200 million and 500 million more people were living in poverty in 2020, reversing the decline in global poverty seen over the last two decades. \"We think that this is... an opportunity to do something radical about building back fairer to think about wealth taxes, to think about corporation taxes, to think about increasing the basic social floor for every citizen,\" Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam's chief executive told the BBC. With reference to the UK, he said imposing a tax could raise millions. Aren't the world's wealthiest doing their bit? Yes - some are. There have been a relatively high number of charitable mega-donations since the pandemic began, with celebrities, sports stars and business leaders responding to the Covid-19 emergency. In an October report, UBS said 209 billionaires had committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020 to fight Covid-19. \"They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds,\" the report added. Last month, MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, revealed she had donated more than $4bn to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. As of June last year, Mr Bezos was said to have donated $125m to the coronavirus effort. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Harry Potter author JK Rowling has donated £1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, says it has committed a total of $1.75bn to the global Covid-19 response, including for the development and delivery of vaccines and tests. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is also the third-largest donor to the World Health Organization.", "summary": "根据慈善组织乐施会（Oxfam）的资料，新冠病毒疫情期间，全世界最富有的10名亿万富豪的总财富增加了5400亿美元（4000亿英镑）。"}

If that happens, it poses a grave threat to local penguins and seals. The animals' normal foraging routes could be blocked, preventing them from feeding their young properly. And it goes without saying that all creatures living on the seafloor would be crushed where A68a touched down - a disturbance that would take a very long time to reverse. \"Ecosystems can and will bounce back of course, but there's a danger here that if this iceberg gets stuck, it could be there for 10 years,\" said Prof Geraint Tarling from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). \"And that would make a very big difference, not just to the ecosystem of South Georgia but its economy as well,\" he told BBC News. The British Overseas Territory is something of a graveyard for Antarctica's greatest icebergs. These tabular behemoths get drawn up from the White Continent on strong currents, only for their keels to then catch in the shallows of the continental shelf that surrounds the remote island. Time and time again, it happens. Huge ice sculptures slowly withering in sight of the land. A68a - which has the look of a hand with a pointing finger - has been riding this \"iceberg alley\" since breaking free from Antarctica in mid-2017. It's now just a few hundred km to the southwest of the BOT. Roughly the size of the English county of Somerset (4,200 sq km), the berg weighs hundreds of billions of tonnes. But its relative thinness (a submerged depth of perhaps 200m or less) means it has the potential to drift right up to South Georgia's coast before anchoring. \"A close-in iceberg has massive implications for where land-based predators might be able to forage,\" explained Prof Tarling. \"When you're talking about penguins and seals during the period that's really crucial to them - during pup- and chick-rearing - the actual distance they have to travel to find food (fish and krill) really matters. If they have to do a big detour, it means they're not going to get back to their young in time to prevent them starving to death in the interim.\" When the colossus A38 grounded at South Georgia in 2004, countless dead penguin chicks and seal pups were found on local beaches. The BAS researcher is in the process of trying to organise the resources to study A68a at South Georgia, should it do its worst and ground in one of the key productive areas for wildlife and the local fishing industry. The potential impacts are multi-faceted - and not all negative, he stresses. For example, icebergs bring with them enormous quantities of dust that will fertilise the ocean plankton around them, and this benefit will then cascade up the food chain. Although satellite imagery suggests A68a is on a direct path for South Georgia, it might yet escape capture. Anything is possible, says BAS remote-sensing and mapping specialist Dr Peter Fretwell. \"The currents should take it on what looks like a strange loop around the south end of South Georgia, before then spinning it along the edge of the continental shelf and back off to the northwest. But it's very difficult to say precisely what will happen,\" he told BBC News. Colleague Dr Andrew Fleming said a request was going into the European Space Agency for more satellite imagery, particularly from its pair of Sentinel-1 radar spacecraft. These imagers work at wavelengths that allow them to see through cloud, meaning they can track the iceberg no matter what the weather conditions are like. \"A68a is spectacular,\" Dr Fleming said. \"The idea that it is still in one large piece is actually remarkable, particularly given the huge fractures you see running through it in the radar imagery. I'd fully expected it to have broken apart by now. \"If it spins around South Georgia and heads on northwards, it should start breaking up. It will very quickly get into warmer waters, and wave action especially will start killing it off.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "世界最大冰山A68a正向英国海外属地南乔治亚岛漂移。这块来自南极洲巨大的冰山与南大西洋南乔治亚岛的大小相似，冰山现在极有可能撞上这座野生动物天堂。如果发生撞击将对当地的企鹅和海豹构成严重威胁。"}

It also reiterated its view that the Chinese yuan continued to remain \"significantly undervalued\". The report has criticised Chinese policy before, but criticism of German economic policy is rarer. \"Germany's anaemic pace of domestic demand growth and dependence on exports have hampered rebalancing at a time when many other euro-area countries have been under severe pressure to curb demand and compress imports in order to promote adjustment,\" the Treasury said. \"The net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area as well as for the world economy.\" 'Bit strange' Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, has been one of its key drivers of growth in recent years. Its importance to the 17-nation bloc has only increased since the development of the region's debt crisis, which has affected other bigger economies such as Italy and Spain. Germany has been one of Europe's stronger economic performers and its exports prowess is seen as one of its key strengths. It narrowly avoided recession earlier this year, but GDP in the second quarter of 2013 was driven up by demand from both consumers and businesses. Analysts said that while Germany could benefit from boosting domestic demand, the criticism levelled at its policies was unfair. \"I think this is a bit strange,\" Tony Nash, vice president at IHS, told the BBC. \"The eurozone has to get growth from somewhere and Germany is the most likely place for that to happen.\" \"And it is better for the eurozone to have a highly concentrated, efficient and skilled export powerhouse in Germany than not have any major engine of growth,\" he added. Yuan concerns In recent years, the US and many other economies have alleged that China tries to keep the value of its currency artificially low. They say that, by doing so, Beijing gives an unfair advantage to its exporters, as an undervalued currency makes its goods cheaper to foreign buyers. For its part, China has been looking to loosen its grip on the currency as it looks to push for a more global role for the yuan. But Beijing has maintained that a sudden and sharp appreciation in the value of the yuan will hurt its overall economy. The yuan has risen nearly 12% against the US dollar since June 2010. While the Treasury acknowledged that the yuan had been rising, it said the appreciation was \"not as fast or by as much as is needed\". \"On the other hand, the evidence that China has resumed large-scale purchases of foreign exchange this year, despite having accumulated reserves that are more than sufficient by any measure, is suggestive of actions that are impeding market determination and a currency that is significantly undervalued,\" it added.

That is what's happening with Japan's rising sun flag and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. And the strongest criticism is from South Korea - where some politicians even compare it to the Nazi swastika. Critics say the flag is flown by fans who want to romanticise and rewrite the human rights abuses by Japanese forces. South Korea wants it banned at the games - but the 2020 organisers say the flag is \"widely used in Japan\" and is \"not a political statement\". What is the rising sun flag? Japan's national flag is simply a red disc on a white background - and no-one has a problem with that one. The rising sun flag has a similar red disc but with 16 red rays coming from it. Both flags have in fact been used for a long time, dating back centuries. During the 19th Century, the rising sun symbol became the flag of the military. As such, it was flying during Japan's imperialist expansion when it occupied Korea and part of China. During World War Two, it became the flag of the navy - and that's largely where it got its controversial reputation. Japanese troops occupied much of Asia during the war, carrying out atrocities against local people. Today, it's still the flag of the country's navy and a slightly different version is used for the regular military. Why is South Korea unhappy with it? In 1905, Japan occupied Korea as a protectorate, and five years later as a full-fledged colony. The Japanese rule was one of economic exploitation and hundreds of thousands of Koreans were pressed into forced labour to aid the Japanese expansion in other parts of Asia. The brutal regime also saw thousands of girls and young women forced to work in military brothels set up for Japanese soldiers before and during World War Two. Known euphemistically as \"comfort women\", they were forced into sexual slavery. Aside from Korean victims, the Japanese army also forced girls from Taiwan, China and the Philippines into the brothels. Many South Koreans associate the rising sun flag with a long list of war crimes and oppression - and see Japan's continued use of the symbol as emblematic of Tokyo's failure to address its past. The flag is \"one thread in a tapestry of other South Korean complaints regarding Japan's perceived inability - or unwillingness - to accept responsibility for colonial transgressions,\" explains Korea analyst Ellen Swicord. South Korea's foreign ministry has described the flag as a symbol of Japanese \"imperialism and militarism\". Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee for sports said it was \"akin to a symbol of the devil to Asians and Koreans, just like the swastika is a symbol of Nazis which reminds European of invasion of horror\". Why no protest from China? Based on a historical experience of Japanese invasion, China's reaction to the rising sun flag at the Olympics could be similar to South Korea's. After the Japanese military took the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937, Japanese troops embarked on a months-long campaign of murder, rape and looting in what became one of the worst massacres of the war. According to Chinese estimates, around 300,000 people were killed, many of them women and children, and around 20,000 women raped. Yet there's little protest from China about the flag. The reason is simple politics, explains Prof David Arase, from the Nanjing campus of Johns Hopkins University. Chinese media is state-controlled and Beijing is currently working to improve ties with Tokyo. In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning to visit Japan in the spring to meet the new Japanese emperor. \"That means China does not make a big issue out of it, and hence people wouldn't be primed for any outrage over that flag,\" Mr Arase says. Is it comparable to the swastika? There are arguments for and against. The rising sun flag has been used as a traditional national symbol of Japan for centuries, and appears in advertisements and on commercial products. In Germany, the swastika was only used when the Nazis were in power. It is now banned in Germany, and the Nazi symbol is only used by extremist groups. Yet even though the rising sun flag has a longer history, \"no-one in Japan uses the rising sun flag for any purpose other than romanticising and rewriting the horrible human rights abuses committed under the Japanese empire,\" argues Koichi Nakano, professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. He suggests a better comparison than the swastika is the Confederate flag in the US. That flag was used in the American civil war by southern states that wanted to keep slavery. The flag is not banned, and is still flown across southern states, but critics say it is a symbol of racial segregation - and perceived superiority. Why won't Japan ban the flag? Despite pressure from South Korea, there has been no concession from Japan so far. There is even an explanation by the foreign ministry, which looks at the overall history of the flag without any references to its role during World War Two. \"The design of the rising sun flag is widely used throughout Japan, such as 'good catch' flags used by fishermen, celebratory flags for childbirth and seasonal festivities, and flags of Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels. \"Claims that the flag is an expression of political assertions or a symbol of militarism are absolutely false.\" In fact, even Japan's liberal newspaper Asahi Shimbun has a version of the flag as its logo. Is this a political move? Japan's reluctance comes at a time where relations between South Korea and Japan are at a new low. Over the summer, a diplomatic feud over wartime labour compensation snowballed into a full-blown trade row between the two sides. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's refusal to act is seen by some as an attempt to please an ultra-conservative faction. \"The current Japanese government is letting extreme nationalism to carry on and is tacitly supporting its expression,\" explains Harrison Kim, assistant professor in history at the University of Hawaii. Yet Japan's alleged inability to properly deal with its brutal imperial past \"is not the fault of the Japan alone\", he says. Rather, it's in part because the US sought to secure Tokyo as an ally during the Cold War. \"The Japanese government did not have to resort to reparations and redress that would appropriately deal with its own past,\" says Mr Kim. The result, he argues, is that Japan has not implemented a permanent way of \"memorialising and apologising for its imperial crimes - not in law, not in education, and not in culture\".", "summary": "在任何国际体育赛事中，支持者们在赛场内挥舞旗帜是再平常不过的画面。"}

The US is trying to bolster its relationship with its Pacific allies, as China asserts territorial claims. But Mr Obama said the embargo decision was not related to US policy on China. \"It's based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalisation with Vietnam,\" he said in Hanoi. Vietnam is one of several countries in the region involved in maritime disputes with China. The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. In 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam. Why Vietnam wants US weapons Beijing's new South China Sea islands High hopes for Obama visit White House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved. \"Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself,\" Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang. Vietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014. Powerful symbolism: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hanoi President Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice? Up to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet. One reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance. Another reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record that might hold up possible arms sales in Congress. The greatest potential for US sales probably lies in areas like military surveillance systems and coastal defence. Vietnam would welcome technology that helps it track Chinese naval forces. The partial lifting of the embargo two years ago was with the specific aim of improving US sales in this area, yet Vietnam is taking its time to decide what it most wants to buy. Mr Obama's visit comes 41 years after the end of the Vietnam War in which the US sought to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam. Several million Vietnamese - civilians, communist fighters and South Vietnamese soldiers - were killed, as well as more than 58,000 US soldiers. By the end of the war in 1975, the communists had gained control of the entire country. While in Vietnam, Mr Obama is expected to meet dissidents and make the case for Vietnam to remove obstacles to the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal. Amnesty International on Monday accused Vietnamese authorities of \"carrying out their repressive business as usual\" in arresting six activists. \"Before leaving Vietnam, President Obama must insist on the release of all prisoners of conscience,\" said its international advocacy director, T Kumar. In a separate move, Vietnamese officials have removed the accreditation of the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi after accusing him of conducting an unauthorised interview - something he denies. The US president flies later to Japan for a summit of the G7 industrialised nations. His visit will include a tour of Hiroshima, where the world's first nuclear attack was carried out in 1945 by the US, killing at least 140,000 people. 'Leverage for Vietnam' - media view The lifting of the US arms embargo \"will tighten the strategic pressure on China\", Vietnamese Communist Youth Union newspaper Tuoi Tre says on its website. \"It will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security patron, Russia,\" the paper says. China's privately-owned portal Sina News sounds a note of alarm, saying that the lifting of the arms embargo \"is a cause for concern\" because it may have an impact on territorial disputes in the South China Sea. A commentary (in Chinese) by Phoenix TV's news anchor Cheng Helin on Sina's \"Headlines Blog\" argues that Vietnam is being drawn into \"co-operation to contain China\" as part of \"a three-way alliance with the US and Japan\". But, says the author, the US is unlikely to sell Vietnam sophisticated weapons. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The report reflects what are said to be deep frustrations at the failure of the company to address previously identified problems. Huawei supplies telecoms for telecoms companies operating in the UK and this report comes ahead of a decision by the UK over whether to allow the company to build next generation 5G networks. Poor practices The US has been campaigning for it to be excluded on the basis the company poses a national security risk. There is no allegation in the latest report that the company is deliberately introducing backdoors or working to carry out any kind of espionage on behalf of the Chinese state. Rather, the accusation is that poor practices by the company create vulnerabilities that in turn pose security risks. The report describes \"significant technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes\". It also says Huawei's approach to software development brings \"significantly increased risk to UK operators\". Officials say the rigorous system of oversight means those risks can be mitigated and managed. But the report also warns that the current arrangement \"can only provide limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term\". Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals but with that come concerns that the business model driving its fast growth can lead to sloppiness in its work. And because the company offers different products to different customers, it has been hard for security officials to be able to confirm that the equipment is all secured to the same standard. Since 2010, after Huawei partnered first with BT and then other telecoms providers to supply equipment in the UK's telecoms infrastructure, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), known as \"the cell\", has been examining the hardware and software deployed. In 2014, a board, chaired by National Cyber Security Centre head Ciaran Martin, was set up to oversee its work. Other government representatives as well as individuals from Huawei and companies that use Huawei equipment also sit on the oversight board. Concerns were raised in last year's annual report but this year its report is highly critical of the failure of the company to address these. Huawei has said it will invest significant sums in dealing with the problems in the next three to five years but it is understood that so far officials have not seen what they consider to be a credible plan to do so. \"No material progress has been made by Huawei in the remediation of the issues reported last year,\" the report says. This raises concerns for the future, according to the oversight board. \"It will be difficult to appropriately risk manage future products in the context of UK deployments, until Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security processes are remediated,\" it says. \"The oversight board currently had not seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's ability to bring about change via its transformation programme.\" The report stresses that the decision over Huawei's role in 5G will come after a wider review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But its warnings raise serious questions as to whether a company whose work on existing systems has proved so problematic should be allowed to play a major role in building the next generation of systems on which significant parts of our daily life will eventually depend. In response, a Huawei representative said it understood the concerns over its software engineering capability and took them \"very seriously\".

While Chinese spies and diplomats pose \"an extremely high risk\" to Czech citizens, Moscow has continued its hybrid warfare strategy to gain influence over this EU and Nato member, it says. Prague's leafy Bubenec district is home to grand villas, diplomatic missions, the Russian embassy, and an excellent Russian-run cafe. \"Thank you,\" I said to the waitress, as she laid down a pot of green tea and a slice of lemon tart. \"You're welcome,\" she replied softly, in Russian-accented Czech. How many spies are here? I opened the 25-page 2017 BIS Annual Report, and turned to the section on counter-intelligence activity. \"For Czech citizens, the Russian diplomatic corps remains the most significant source of risk of unwitting contact with an intelligence officer of a foreign power,\" the report reads. It highlights an \"extensive approach to the use of undeclared intelligence officers using diplomatic cover\". Russia's embassy employs 44 accredited diplomats and 77 support staff while another 18 people, including eight diplomats, are employed at Russia's consulates in Brno and Karlovy Vary. The exact number of spies using diplomatic cover is known only to Moscow. But privately Czech officials believe it could be as high as 40%. In other words, they think many may be working for Russian intelligence or passing intelligence on to them. Around the corner from the cafe is a statue of Marshal Konev, the Russian general who liberated Prague in 1945 and went on to crush the Hungarian Uprising in 1956. A brisk walk takes you through Pushkin Square, then on to Siberia Square and the Russian secondary school. Nearby are the Russian Cultural Centre, the Russian consulate and the Russian embassy - now a major headache for the Czech government. One diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the supersized Russian diplomatic presence also posed a threat to neighbouring Germany and Austria. 'What does Russia want from us?' The disproportionately high number of diplomatic cars registered to the embassy cannot be stopped or examined by police, and can travel easily around Europe's passport-free Schengen travel area. \"Who knows what they've got in the boot?\" my source wondered, adding that Prague was now beginning to \"push back\", denying new Russian requests for vehicle registration. \"What does Russia want from us? It's difficult to answer,\" said journalist Jaroslav Spurny, who's been writing about intelligence matters for 30 years. \"Partly it's influence. They liberated us in 1945. They 'liberated' us again in 1968. They still see us as their sphere of influence. So on that level it's quite primitive,\" he explained. \"But we're also part of the EU and Nato. The Russian intelligence services know very well where the weaknesses are, which countries can be exploited.\" \"The Hungarians - well, the relationship with (Prime Minister) Orban isn't so straightforward. The Poles - relations with them will never be great.\" \"But with us Czechs it's different. They occupied us for 20 years. They know us. They know how things work.\" Why China is becoming a Czech problem The BIS report also warns of frenetic Chinese espionage activity, particularly in technology. A separate alert came this month from the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency of a threat from Chinese IT giant Huawei. \"The Chinese approach is de facto just as hybrid as the Russian one,\" said the intelligence agency, adding that Chinese career diplomats and businessmen represented the same risk as intelligence officers. China, it says, has three aims: The report has led to a major spat between the BIS and Czech President Milos Zeman, who has made overtures to both Moscow and Beijing a centrepiece of his presidency. How spy report angered Czech president President Zeman described the BIS as \"dilettantes\" and the report as \"blather\", provoking a rare public rebuke from the agency's director. That rebuke was countered by presidential spokesman Jiri Ovcacek, who told the BBC: \"It is absolutely unacceptable for the director of the secret services of a Western country to indulge in political point-scoring.\" Critics accuse the president of deliberately working to undermine his own intelligence services, and insiders claim the BIS is now withholding sensitive information for fear it will be betrayed to the country's adversaries. A particular problem, they say, are the president's two closest advisers, who lack security clearance to see classified documents.

Founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said news content would soon make up around 4% of what appeared in people's News Feeds - down from 5% before. The move is the latest attempt by the company to quell the spread of so-called fake news and propaganda on the network. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook As part of that continuing battle, Twitter also announced on Friday that it had notified 677,775 US-based users who had retweeted, liked or followed Russian bot accounts on the network in the run up to the 2016 US presidential election. The change is an attempt to shift the key judgements over bias and accuracy away from Facebook's employees, and onto its user base. \"We could try to make that decision ourselves, but that's not something we're comfortable with,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. \"We considered asking outside experts, which would take the decision out of our hands but would likely not solve the objectivity problem. Or we could ask you - the community - and have your feedback determine the ranking.\" Users will be asked, as they sometimes are about advertising, whether they recognise a news brand and if they trust it. Facebook's theory - yet to be tested on a large scale - is that while there are many partisan outlets that have readers that trust them, there is a smaller subset of media companies that a majority people find \"broadly trustworthy\", whatever their particular leanings. \"There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarisation in the world today,\" wrote Mr Zuckerberg, who recently announced that his challenge this year was to essentially \"fix\" Facebook. \"Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them.\" Winners and losers The news ranking system will first be tested on US-based users only, and the results of the survey will not be made public. \"This is one of many signals that go into News Feed ranking,\" a Facebook spokesman told the BBC. \"We do not plan to release individual publishers' trust scores because they represent an incomplete picture of how each story's position in each person's feed is determined.\" As with any algorithm change, be it Facebook or any other major web service, there will be some that benefit and others that will struggle. Facebook - the secret election weapon Among the winners will likely be traditional media organisations with long histories or a strong broadcast presence, such as the New York Times or BBC. However, emerging brands will suffer if recognition is not as strong, regardless of whether the content is trustworthy or not. For instance, Buzzfeed's initial beginnings as a viral site would have almost certainly hindered its growth into a serious news organisation had it been subject to the ideas about to be put in place by Mr Zuckerberg's team. Also, it is unclear how trustworthy, specialist news organisations with smaller readerships - such as science publications - will be treated under these rules, though Facebook's head of News Feed Adam Mosseri said local news would at least be protected. \"We're making it easier for people to see local news and information in a dedicated section. \"We'll continue to work on ways to show more local news that is relevant to where people live.\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370", "summary": "脸书（Facebook）宣布将在用户页面上优先展示被认为可靠新闻机构的内容。"}

The Leeds Teaching Hospitals team, who presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, described the results as \"stunning\". The British Heart Foundation called for longer trials to assess the pills. Vitamin D is vital for healthy bones and teeth and may have important health benefits throughout the body but many people are deficient. No safe way to suntan - warning The average age of people in the study was 70 and, like many people that age, they had low levels of vitamin D even in summer. \"They do spend less time outside, but the skin's ability to manufacture vitamin D also gets less effective [with age] and we don't really understand why that is,\" said consultant cardiologist Dr Klaus Witte. Patients were given either a 100 microgram vitamin D tablet or a sugar pill placebo each day for a year. And researchers measured the impact on heart failure - a condition in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood properly. The key measure was the ejection fraction, the amount of blood pumped out of the chambers of the heart with each beat. In a healthy adult, the figure is between 60% and 70%, but only a quarter of the blood in the heart was being successfully pumped out in the heart failure patients. But in those taking the vitamin pills, the ejection fraction increased from 26% to 34%. Dr Witte told the BBC News website: \"It's quite a big deal, that's as big as you'd expect from other more expensive treatments that we use, it's a stunning effect. \"It's as cheap as chips, has no side effects and a stunning improvement on people already on optimal medical therapy, it is the first time anyone has shown something like this in the last 15 years.\" The study also showed the patients' hearts became smaller - a suggestion they are becoming more powerful and efficient. In the UK, people over 65 are advised to take 10 microgram supplements of the vitamin. However, Dr Witte does not think high-dose vitamin D should be routine prescribed just yet. He told the BBC: \"We're a little bit off that yet, not because I don't believe it, but data have shown improvements in heart function, they may show improvements in symptoms and we now need a large study.\" It is also not clear exactly how vitamin D is improving heart function, but it is thought every cell in the body responds to the vitamin. Most vitamin D comes from sunlight, although it is also found in oily fish, eggs and is added to some foods such as breakfast cereals. Prof Peter Weissberg, from the British Heart Foundation, cautioned that the patients seemed no better at exercise. And added: \"A much bigger study over a longer period of time is now needed to determine whether these changes in cardiac function can translate into fewer symptoms and longer lives for heart failure patients.\" Follow James on Twitter.

Europe's \"crisis of democracy\" is a gap between elites and voters, EIU says. There is \"a gaping hole at the heart of European politics where big ideas should be\", it adds. Low turnouts at the polls and sharp falls in the membership of traditional parties are key factors in the phenomenon. 'Highly destabilising' The United Kingdom - going to the polls in May - is \"on the cusp of a potentially prolonged period of political instability\", according to the Economist researchers. They say there is a much higher than usual chance that the election will produce an unstable government - predicting that the populist UK Independence Party (UKIP) will take votes from both the Conservatives and Labour. The fragmentation of voters' preferences combined with Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system will, the EIU says, make it increasingly difficult to form the kind of single-party governments with a parliamentary majority that have been the norm. But the most immediate political challenge - and test of how far the growing populism translates into success at the polls - is in Greece. A snap general election takes place there on 25 January, triggered by parliament's failure to choose a new president in December. Opinion polls suggest that the far left, populist Syriza could emerge as the strongest party. If it did and was able to form a government, the EIU says this would send shock waves through the European Union and act as a catalyst for political upheaval elsewhere. \"The election of a Syriza government would be highly destabilising, both domestically and regionally. It would almost certainly trigger a crisis in the relationship between Greece and its international creditors, as debt write-offs form one of the core planks of its policy platform,\" the EIU says. \"With similar anti-establishment parties gaining ground rapidly in a number of other countries scheduled to hold elections in 2015, the spill-over effects from a further period of Greek turmoil could be significant.\" 'Immigration and austerity' Other examples of European elections with potential for unpredictable results cited by EIU include polls in Denmark, Finland, Spain, France, Sweden, Germany and Ireland. \"There is a common denominator in these countries: the rise of populist parties,\" the EIU says, \"Anti-establishment sentiment has surged across the eurozone (and the larger EU) and the risk of political disruption and potential crises is high.\" Its analysis is that populist parties and movements - of the left, the right and the indeterminate - are moving into the space that has opened up between the old political parties and their traditional social base. Opposition to governance from Brussels, immigration and austerity are key themes and rallying cries for many of these parties. 'Upsurge of protests' Meanwhile, alongside the rise to prominence of populist movements, there has been an upsurge of popular protest in many parts of the world in recent years. The EIU estimates that significant protest movements surfaced in more than 90 countries during the past five years - in the main, it says, led by young, educated, middle class individuals who resent their political leaders and who prefer Twitter and other social networks to the traditional political soap box. \"An upsurge of popular protest has swept through Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America in recent years. Other regions such as Asia and North America have been less susceptible, although have not escaped entirely,\" the EIU says. \"The mainsprings of the protests have been different - some have been responses to economic distress, others are revolts against dictatorship; some are expressions of a popular desire to have their voices heard by political elites, others express the aspirations of new middle classes in fast-growing emerging markets.\" BBC Democracy Day All these developments pose the question of whether they do actually represent a threat to democracy or are proof that it is alive and well. If we take the Arab Spring as a springboard for democracy in a region where it was notable for its absence, the result so far of course has been decidedly limited democratic change and a great deal of upheaval. And the impact of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, for example, is yet to become clear - protesters there dismissing Beijing's proposals for the way in which Hong Kong will be able to choose its own leader as \"fake democracy\". And in the world's most populous nation itself, Western-style democracy is nowhere on the horizon - though whether that position can and will be sustained indefinitely in the face of democratic trends elsewhere in Asia and the expansion of China's middle class is another question. For now, the unpredictable fate of the \"old\" democracies will undoubtedly be watched closely by governments and activists of all political hues around the world.", "summary": "据《经济学人》旗下经济学人智库（EIU）为BBC民主日所撰写的研究报告所言，欧洲2015年将可能发生连场政治地震。"}

It is also expected to warn of effects on agriculture that could raise prices of potatoes and other vegetables. At the government's recent \"drought summit\", water companies were urged to step up measures to reduce leakage and eliminate unnecessary water use. The Environment Agency is expected to reinforce that call in its report. A number of water companies in the southern half of England, covering about 20 million people, are understood to have contingency plans in place that could lead to bans on non-essential uses, perhaps before the end of March. These could include bans on car-washing, watering gardens and filling swimming pools. Meanwhile, the area formally in drought is expected to extend beyond south-eastern counties to include parts of Yorkshire. Counties that have received much less rainfall in recent months also include Shropshire and Somerset. The National Farmers Union has warned of the impact on both arable and livestock farming, and is asking for restrictions on agricultural water use to be avoided wherever possible. Farmers have reportedly planted 80% of the area they usually fill with crops, and are expecting lower than average yields. But conservation groups point out that if farmers, householders or businesses take more water from rivers and lakes that are already poorly supplied, wildlife will feel the effects. Reservoirs such as Bewl Bridge in Kent are below half of their normal level for the time of year. Heavy rains could yet stave off the worst of the impacts, but forecasters are predicting drier than average conditions for the next few months. In the worst case, this could lead to emergency measures such as supplies being limited to public standpipes in the street being implemented, as was the case during the 1976 drought.", "summary": "英国大部分地区正面临强降雨的袭击，预计未来几天，持续的降雨将造成路面积水，河流水位将达到警戒线。"}

MSF said the figure was revised after a detailed investigation, complicated by the extensive damage to the clinic. A US military inquiry said the attack was the result of \"human error\" but MSF has called it a war crime. The charity is campaigning for an independent international inquiry into the bombardment, which took place as US-backed Afghan forces were battling to reverse the Taliban's seizure of Kunduz. A statement released by MSF on Saturday said the dead included 14 staff members, 24 patients, and four relatives of patients who were helping in their care. The charity said it had carried out extensive efforts to identify the dead, interviewing staff members and patients and checking figures with other hospitals that treated MSF patients following the attack. Many records held at the clinic had been destroyed in the initial attack, the charity said, and human remains had been found in the rubble of the hospital over the past two months. The US military's investigation into the attack, released on 25 November, concluded that the crew of the AC-130 gunship mistook the clinic for a nearby government building that had been seized by Taliban fighters. The gunship fired 211 shells at the MSF compound over 25 minutes, the US military said, insisting that the attack was a \"tragic mistake\". Shortly after the incident, the medical charity disputed initial US justifications for the attack, which said US forces had struck the hospital because they had come under fire in the area. Meanwhile, a UN report has concluded that at least 289 Afghan civilians were killed and 559 wounded during the Taliban's brief seizure of Kunduz in September, and the campaign to retake the northern city. The report detailed a climate of chaos in the city, with food shortages and allegations of human rights abuses by fighters on both sides. Differing US statements on hospital strike Saturday 3 October - Col Brian Tribus, spokesman for US Forces in Afghan US forces conducted an airstrike in Kunduz city at 2:15am (local), Oct 3, against individuals threatening the force. The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility. This incident is under investigation. Sunday 4 October - Pentagon press office US forces conducted an airstrike in Kunduz city at 2:15am (local), Oct 3, against insurgents who were directly firing upon US service members advising and assisting Afghan Security Forces in the city of Kunduz. The strike was conducted in the vicinity of a Doctors Without Borders medical facility. Monday 5 October - Gen John Campbell, US military chief in Afghanistan We have now learned that on October 3, Afghan forces advised that they were taking fire from enemy positions and asked for air support from US forces. An airstrike was then called to eliminate the Taliban threat and several civilians were accidentally struck. This is different from the initial reports, which indicated that US forces were threatened and that the airstrike was called on their behalf. Tuesday 6 October - Gen John Campbell to the Senate committee On Saturday morning our forces provided close air support to Afghan forces at their request. To be clear the decision to provide aerial fires was a US decision, made within the US chain of command. A hospital was mistakenly struck. We would never intentionally target a protected medical facility… I assure you that the investigation will be thorough, objective and transparent. Wednesday 25 November - Gen John Campbell statement The US strike upon the MSF Trauma Centre in Kunduz... was the direct result of human error, compounded by systems and procedural failures.

In its first broadcast interview, chief executive Guo Ping told the BBC the US ban was \"not very important\". \"If they're not ready, we can wait,\" he said. Huawei is run by three rotating chief executives, who serve as the boss for six months at a time. Mr Guo is the current chief. US suspicions In the first half of the year, revenues have reached nearly $20bn (£12.5bn), so the company is on track to beat or match last year's total of $39.4bn. More than 65% of its income is from businesses outside of China, and they operate in more than 150 countries. But they have challenges operating in the US. Huawei and other Chinese tech companies such as ZTE have been banned from bidding for US government contracts, because of suspicions that they undertake industrial espionage for China. Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, had served in the Chinese army before he started the company in 1987 and that stint is one of the reasons why US lawmakers believe that the company still has links to the state. Other countries such as Australia have also raised concerns. Huawei has denied all of these allegations. Mr Guo told me he was confident that the suspicions in the world's biggest market would not dent the company's global ambitions. He pointed to the fact that Huawei achieved growth of 19% in the first half of this year, without the US, and believes that it can maintain that trend. He added that the company would happily serve the US market in the future, if permitted to. \"If the United States needs our products someday, we are more than happy to have the chance to serve them. If they're not ready, we can wait,\" he said. When I asked if the ban was unfair, he replied: \"I do not have that feeling. People around the world can enjoy Huawei's products and services. If one country can't, I feel it may be a bit unfair for their consumers. But for Huawei, it's not very important.\" Taking on the phone giants In 2012, Huawei overtook Ericsson to become the world's largest telecommunications equipment firm. It supplies the networks for companies such as BT, as well as the USB dongles that power mobile internet access for Vodafone, among others. In the past five years, it has also quickly become the third-biggest mobile handset producer, behind only market leaders Samsung and Apple, and it seeks to improve its position. With the launch of its latest \"phablet\", a combination phone and tablet, the firm is looking to become a global brand. Mr Guo says that he wants not only industry insiders to know of the company, but also the world's entire population of seven billion. Last week, Huawei became the first Chinese name to make it on to Interbrand's list of the 100 best global brands. Ranked 94th, Huawei's sights are set on Apple, which remains the world's top brand.", "summary": "全球最大通信产品生产商——中国华为公司的负责人表示，他有信心尽管不能进入美国市场也无损集团扩充其全球业务。"}

The two countries have run an internationally recognised joint vaccine development programme for more than three decades. They have worked on stopping dengue, enteric diseases, influenza and TB in their tracks. Trials of a dengue vaccine are planned in the near future. India is among the largest manufacturer of generic drugs and vaccines in the world. It is home to half a dozen major vaccine makers and a host of smaller ones, making doses against polio, meningitis, pneumonia, rotavirus, BCG, measles, mumps and rubella, among other diseases. Now half a dozen Indian firms are developing vaccines against the virus that causes Covid-19. One of them is Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by number of doses produced and sold globally. The 53-year-old company makes 1.5 billion doses every year, mainly from its two facilities in the western city of Pune. (It has two other small plants in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.) Around 7,000 people work for the firm. The company supplies some 20 vaccines to 165 countries. Some 80% of its vaccines are exported and, at an average of 50 cents a dose, they are some of the cheapest in the world. Now the firm has stitched up collaboration with Codagenix, an American biotech company, to develop a \"live attenuated\" vaccine, among the more than 80 reportedly in development all over the world. This vaccine is created by reducing the virulence - or removing the harmful properties - of a pathogen but keeping it alive. (They cause no or very mild disease because the pathogen is weakened under laboratory conditions.) \"We are planning a set of animal trials [on mice and primates] of this vaccine in April. By September, we should be able to begin human trials,\" Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India, told me over the phone. Mr Poonawalla's firm has also partnered to mass produce a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and backed by the UK government. A genetically engineered chimpanzee virus would form the basis for the new vaccine. Human clinical trials began in Oxford on Thursday. If all goes well, scientists hope to make at least a million doses by September. \"It's pretty clear the world is going to need hundreds of millions of doses, ideally by the end of this year, to end this pandemic, to lead us out of lockdown,\" Prof Adrian Hill, who runs the Jenner Institute at Oxford, told the BBC's Health and Science correspondent James Gallagher. This is where Indian vaccine makers have a head start over others. Mr Poonawalla's firm alone has an extra capacity of 400 to 500 million doses. \"We have lots of capacity as we have invested in it,\" he says. There's more. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech had announced a partnership with the University of Wisconsin Madison and US-based firm FluGen to make almost 300 million doses of a vaccine for global distribution. Zydus Cadilla is working on two vaccines, while Biological E, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing a vaccine each. Another four or five home-grown vaccines are in early stages of development. \"The credit must go to entrepreneurs and pharmaceutical companies who invested in quality manufacturing and in processes that made it possible to produce in bulk. The owners of these companies have also had the goal of doing good for the world, while also running a successful business and this model is a win-win for all,\" Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of the World Health Organization (WHO), told me. Experts warn that people should not be expecting a vaccine in the market any time soon. David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, says humans will have to live with the threat of coronavirus \"for the foreseeable future\" because there's no guarantee that a vaccine will be successfully developed. And Tim Lahey, a vaccine researcher at the University of Vermont Medical Centre, warns that there's a \"good reason to worry a coronavirus vaccine would elicit harmful immune responses too\". Global Covid-19 infections have hit nearly 3m with more than 206,000 deaths. Developing a safe vaccine which can be mass produced is going to be a time consuming exercise - every lot has to be chemically and biologically tested before being released. \"But we are hopeful, very hopeful, of having a safe and efficacious vaccine in two years or less,\" says Mr Poonawalla.

Meanwhile, a private survey from from HSBC showed that growth in Chinese factories in November stalled as output shrank for the first time in six months. The final HSBC/Markit manufacturing PMI slipped to a six-month low of 50 in November, down from 50.4 in October.

Output fell to 49.6, which was the worst reading since May. \"Muted growth in new work,\" led companies to hold back production, HSBC/Markit said. Boost needed Growth in the world's second largest economy fell to 7.3% in the third quarter, which was the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. The risk that China might miss its official growth target of 7.5% this year for the first time in 15 years is growing because economic data is weaker than expected, economists said. A struggling property market, uneven export growth and cooling domestic demand and investment are some of the major factors weighing on overall growth. Alaistair Chan, economist at Moody's Analytics, said he had expected the slowdown in manufacturing and was a \"little more pessimistic\" than the market for two reasons. \"Firstly, there are signs the recent export boom is fading. Meanwhile, the housing market and related sectors such as steel and cement manufacturing, remains in a slump,\" Mr Chan said.

Earlier this month, the country's central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to 2.75% for first time since 2012 in an attempt to revive the economy. Mr Chan said Monday's data shows further evidence that fourth quarter growth will be about the same as the third quarter with growth \"below China's potential\" and the government's target. \"Monetary policy may need further action, possibly with a reserve ratio cut or another interest rate cut, by year end,\" he said.", "summary": "中国11月制造业活动放缓幅度高于预期，凸显出经济增长冷却为中国制造商带来的负面影响。"}

Results also show that more than half of voters do not believe their current government and MPs reflect the views of the British public towards the EU - including 67% of Leave voters. And 59% of respondents said they were not confident in Britain's political leaders to get the best possible terms for Britain - rising to 76% of Remain voters. Quizzed on two of the most contentious issues of the campaign - free movement and membership of the single market - marginally more voters favoured the UK continuing without restrictions on migration in return for continuing to trade in the single market. A total of 42% of respondents said Britain should continue to allow EU citizens to live and work in Britain in return for access to the single market - including 18% of Leave voters. But 38% of those polled said losing access to the single market would be a price worth paying for new curbs on immigration. The overwhelming finding of the poll was that most voters are sticking to their positions - 83% of Remain voters now feel less hopeful for the future of the UK, compared to the 80% of Leave voters who are now more hopeful. Interviews with adults aged 18-75 across Great Britain were conducted online. Data are weighted to match the profile of the population, and to the estimated relative vote share of this group in the EU referendum.

It also called on the Bank of England to enact policy measures \"early and gradually\" to avoid a housing bubble. In April, the IMF said the UK economy would grow by 2.9% in 2014. The Fund's annual health check of the UK economy found it has \"rebounded strongly and growth is becoming more balanced\" adding economic growth would \"remain strong this year.\" It is a significant turnaround from last year when the IMF's chief economist Oliver Blanchard appeared to have a public falling out with the chancellor after he criticised the government's austerity policies. This year IMF managing director Christine Lagarde admitted the Fund \"got it wrong\" in its assessment adding that while the UK's economic recovery began with consumer spending, it was now rebalancing towards an \"investment-led recovery\". The chancellor said the IMF was \"right to warn the government that risks still remain\" to the UK's economic recovery. Ms Lagarde called on financial regulators to consider imposing limits on the number of low-deposit mortgages a bank or building society can advance to borrowers, highlighting fears that some people may be at risk of overstretching their finances. The IMF report said: \"House price inflation is particularly high in London, and is becoming more widespread. So far, there are few of the typical signs of a credit-led bubble. \"Nonetheless, a steady increase in the size of new mortgages compared with borrower incomes suggests that households are gradually becoming more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks.\" It added: \"Macroprudential policies should be the first line of defence against financial risks from the housing market.\" It said that raising mortgage lenders' capital requirements \"would build additional buffers against increased exposures to the housing sector\". Help to Buy The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is due to meet later in June and could announce measures to control mortgage lending. In May, 25% taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group said it would limit its mortgage lending to four times a borrower's income on loans above £500,000. On Tuesday, Royal Bank of Scotland - which remains 80% taxpayer-owned - said it would also restrict the amount it advanced to mortgage borrowers. The IMF added the government should consider modifying or even pulling the plug on its flagship mortgage guarantee scheme - known as Help to Buy 2 - if house prices showed signs of overheating. Recent figures from the Treasury showed 7,000 homes were bought through the Help to Buy scheme between its launch in October and March. That amounted to just over £1bn of mortgages since the scheme's launch, involving just £153m of government guarantees. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, has previously warned the risk of a house price bubble developing across the UK is \"very real\". Earlier the chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need to be alert to the build-up of debt in the housing market, we need to be alert when we see house prices rising.\" \"We have created - this government, me as chancellor - the mechanism to deal with that, \"We have given the Bank of England the tools to do the job and they should not hesitate to use those tools if they see these developments turning into a risk for the British economy.\" Interest rates While the IMF praised the Bank of England's policy of forward guidance, it warned that if economic growth expanded more than current forecasts suggest, interest rates might have to rise more quickly in order to control inflation. Bank governor Mark Carney has previously stated that he envisages interest rates rising from their historic low of 0.5% incrementally and not before the middle of 2015. The IMF also echoed the Bank of England's own concerns about productivity levels, saying that despite evidence of the UK economic recovery strengthening, productivity growth remained low. It added \"Accelerating productivity growth would spur investment and output, while allowing real wage increases without triggering inflation. If productivity continues to be flat, however, growth will eventually stall.\" Productivity reflects the amount and value of the goods and services produced by an employee of a company. But productivity depends partly on business investment. In February, the Bank of England said there was still a significant amount of \"slack\" in the economy, meaning that it was not growing to its full potential because of underinvestment. It estimated the amount of slack in the economy was equivalent to about 1% to 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). Earlier, the Office of National Statistics showed the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the world - the different between the value of the goods and services the country exports and imports - widened in April to £2.5bn. The UK's goods deficit widened in April to £9.6bn from £8.3bn in March and £8.5bn a year earlier, denting the chancellor's hopes of boosting exports in an effort to rebalance the economy.", "summary": "际货币基金组织（IMF）向英国财相奥斯本发出警告，房价上涨过快以及生产效率降低，将对英国经济复苏构成最大威胁。"}

Tsarnaev is likely to be moved to a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, to await execution, but there could be years of appeals. Victims sobbed as the sentence was read, but Tsarnaev showed no emotion. \"Now he will go away and we will be able to move on. Justice. In his own words, 'an eye for an eye',\" said bombing victim Sydney Corcoran, who nearly bled to death and whose mother lost both legs. After 14 hours of deliberations, the jury concluded that he showed no remorse and therefore should be put to death. \"The jury has spoken. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will pay for his crimes with his life,'' said US Attorney Carmen Ortiz. Tsarnaev was found guilty last month of helping carry out the attack, as well as fatally shooting a policeman. As a state, Massachusetts ended the death penalty in 1984, but Tsarnaev was tried on federal charges, meaning he was eligible for execution. Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Boston Tsarnaev stood next to his lawyer. He tilted his head to the side and shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he heard the clerk read the notes from the jurors. After the death sentence was announced, he bowed his head. A juror with gold hoop earrings took a drink from a water bottle. A moment later she started to cry. Another juror touched her to reassure her and to comfort her. Another juror with dark-framed glasses and a blue shirt cried too. He took off his glasses. He wiped his forehead and wiped his eyes. He bit his lips, distraught. After the sentence was announced, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said: \"The ultimate penalty is a fitting punishment for this horrific crime and we hope that the completion of this prosecution will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families.'' But not all of the victims supported the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The parents of Martin Richard, an eight-year-old boy killed in the blast, wrote an article in the Boston Globe newspaper last month asking the government to not seek a death sentence as it would delay their emotional closure. The Associated Press news agency reached Tsarnaev's father, Anzor Tsarnaev, by phone in the Russian region of Dagestan on Friday. He moaned after hearing the sentence and hung up. During the trial, Tsarnaev's defence team admitted that he had played a role in the attacks but said that his older brother, Tamerlan - shot dead by police in the subsequent manhunt - was the driving force. Lawyers also highlighted his difficult early life. The Tsarnaevs - ethnic Chechens - had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia, near Chechnya. The family moved to the US in 2002. The victims Victims' profiles in full But prosecutors argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was an equal partner in the attack, showing the jury a message he wrote on the boat where he was arrested. \"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop,\" it read. Throughout the trial, the jurors heard grisly testimony from bombing survivors. They described seeing their legs blown off or watching someone next to them die. At the start of the penalty phase, the prosecutors showed jurors a photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev raising his middle finger to a jail cell security camera months after his arrest. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" prosecutor Nadine Pellegrin said. Reaction from Russian social media The Tsarnaev brothers were of Chechen descent.

More than 300 died, most of them school students. Lee Joon-seok was among 15 crew members on trial over the sinking, one of South Korea's worst maritime disasters. Prosecutors charged him with homicide and called for the death penalty, but judges acquitted him on that charge. Lee is in his late 60s, and he accepted in court that he would spend the rest of his days in jail, according to the BBC's Steve Evans in Gwangju. The judges said that he was clearly not the only person responsible for the tragedy and they accepted that his negligence did not amount to an intent to kill. The disaster was blamed on a combination of illegal redesigns, the overloading of cargo and the inexperience of the crew member steering the vessel. Crew members did not secure cargo which moved when the vessel took a tight corner, toppling the ferry, and Lee was filmed leaving the sinking ship while many passengers remained inside. During the trial, Lee apologised for abandoning them. The chief engineer of the ferry, identified by his surname Park, was found guilty of murder and jailed for 30 years. Thirteen other crew members were given jail sentences of up to 20 years on charges including abandonment and violating maritime law. Relatives of victims were distraught at the verdict, with some weeping. The AFP news agency reported that one woman screamed in the courtroom: \"It's not fair. What about the lives of our children? They (the defendants) deserve worse than death.\" Stephen Evans, BBC News, Gwangju When the judgement was handed down, there were cries of anguish and anger from some of the bereaved families in court. They had wanted the verdict to be murder as a mark of the seriousness of the negligence committed by the people in charge of the ship. One bereaved father said after the judgement that he was 30 years old, and that if he had to wait 30 years for the guilty ship's officers to come out of jail, he would - and he would go after them. The case has been the focus of wider anger. The man who will never face trial is the owner of the company. The Sewol had been altered to take more cargo and in the process been made less stable. As the authorities pursued him, the chairman of the operating company, Yoo byung-eun, fled and was later found dead in a field. Just hours before the verdict, the South Korean government finally called off the search for bodies in the vessel, which sank on 16 April. A total of 295 bodies have been retrieved by teams of divers but nine people remain unaccounted for. The disaster triggered nationwide grief followed by outrage, and led to severe criticism of safety standards and of the government's handling of the rescue operation. The South Korean coast guard is due to be disbanded and replaced with a new agency, after accusations that it did not act swiftly or aggressively enough to save lives. Sewol victims At the end of the trial last month, Mr Lee said he had committed a crime for which he deserved to die - but denied that he had intended to sacrifice the lives of the passengers and asked not to be branded as a murderer. The widespread outcry over the case had led to doubts over whether the crew would get a fair hearing. A separate trial is taking place for employees of the firm that operated the ferry, Chonghaejin Marine Co. The owner of the company and billionaire businessman Yoo Byung-eun disappeared after the disaster and was later found dead. Meanwhile last week three of his relatives were jailed for embezzlement, while a French court is due to decide next month on whether to extradite Yoo's daughter on similar charges.", "summary": "韩国法官星期二（11月11日）作出裁决，判处4月“世越号”客轮沉没事件中的船长有期徒刑36年。"}

The research looked at the diets of more than 187,000 people in the US. But Diabetes UK said the results of the study should be treated with caution. Researchers from the UK, US and Singapore used data from three large studies of nurses and health professionals in the US to examine the link between fruit consumption and the risk of contracting type-2 diabetes. In these studies, 6.5% of participants (12,198 out of 187,382) developed type-2 diabetes. The studies used food frequency questionnaires to follow up the participants every four years, asking how often, on average, they ate a standard portion of each fruit. The fruits used in the study were grapes or raisins, peaches, plums or apricots, prunes, bananas, cantaloupe, apples or pears, oranges, grapefruit, strawberries and blueberries. The researchers' analysis of the data showed that three servings per week of blueberries, grapes and raisins, and apples and pears significantly reduced the risk of type-2 diabetes. While all fruit was shown to reduce the risk, these fruits appeared to be particularly effective. The researchers said this could be due to the fact these fruits contain high levels of anthocyanins, which have been shown to enhance glucose uptake in mice. The same fruits contain naturally-occurring polyphenols which are known to have beneficial effects. In the study paper, they wrote: \"Fruits have highly variable contents of fibre, antioxidants, other nutrients, and phytochemicals that jointly may influence the risk.\" But the glycaemic load of different types of fruit - the quality and quantity of carbohydrate they contain - did not fully explain the results, the study said. Juice effect When they looked at the effects of fruit juice consumption, the researchers found a slightly increased risk of type-2 diabetes. The study calculated that replacing weekly fruit juice consumption with whole fruits could bring health benefits. For example, replacing fruit juice with blueberries could reduce the risk of contracting type-2 diabetes by 33%, with grapes and raisins by 19%, apples and pears by 13% - and with any combination of whole fruit by 7%. Replacing fruit juice with oranges, peaches, plums and apricots had a similar effect. Qi Sun, study author and assistant professor at Harvard School of Public Health, said, in general, fruit juices contained less of the beneficial compounds found in whole fruits. \"The juicing process gets rid of the fruit, just leaving fluids which are absorbed more quickly, causing blood sugars and insulin levels to rise if they contain sugars. \"To try to minimise the risk of type-2 diabetes as much as possible it is reasonable to reduce fruit juice consumption and increase consumption of whole fruits.\" Experts say the best way to reduce your risk of developing type-2 diabetes is to eat a balanced, healthy diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables and to be as physically active as possible. 'Unreliable' Dr Matthew Hobbs, head of research for Diabetes UK, said the study provided further evidence that eating plenty of whole fruit was a key part of the balanced diet that will minimise the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. However, he said the links between type-2 diabetes and specific types of fruit or fruit drinks should be treated with caution. \"Some of the findings are based on a number of assumptions and models which may have distorted the results significantly. \"For example, the researchers used surveys to ask participants how often they ate certain foods. This type of survey can often be unreliable as people are more likely to remember certain types of food.\" Kamlesh Khunti, professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, said the large study showed that eating any fruit is good. \"Eating all kinds of fruit works and there is still a reduction in risk. \"The government recommends eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day.\"", "summary": "发表在《英国医学杂志》的一篇文章说，食用蓝莓、葡萄、苹果有助于降低患二型糖尿病的风险，但食用果汁却会起到相反作用。"}

The number of dementia sufferers worldwide is expected to treble to 135m by 2050. Here, BBC News website readers and BBC Breakfast viewers with experiences of dealing with dementia share their views and stories. Hannah Nicholls, Torquay, Devon, UK Both of my grandmothers and one of my partner's grandparents suffered and died at the hands of dementia. I watched as the two most beautiful and strong women in my life were reduced to a mere shell of there former selves. I am passionate about finding a cure and more support for people living with, and dying from, dementia on a daily basis. People try and ignore it and don't understand how terrible it is and how it affects the whole family of sufferers. When someone with dementia dies, they are not the same person. It is quite an emotional journey. My partner and I, along with my 14-year-old daughter, raised money by walking 26 miles for the Alzheimer's Society earlier this year. I also work in elderly residential care, which is not specifically for people with dementia and Alzheimer's, but there are some people with dementia who may not have been diagnosed. So I am excited by the G8 meeting on dementia and hope that there can be a real plan put in place and hope for the future. The whole approach to Alzheimer's and dementia must change. We are all responsible for the care of these unfortunate people and attitudes must change. Lorna, Southampton My 78-year-old mother has been diagnosed with dementia, but it was noticeable well before her diagnosis. My father, who is 80, is her carer. He suffers daily with emphysema and suffered a mild stroke earlier this year. When we asked the Alzheimer's society and the adult social care team about arranging an emergency care plan for my mother, they said they cannot do anything unless my mother signs an agreement stating she has dementia and my father is her carer. The huge problem is that my mother does not and will not admit she has dementia. She refuses to let nursing staff into the house and will not take her medication. It is difficult as a family to step in as she gets angry and shuts down if you mention dementia. You cannot have a proper conversation with her and she no longer remembers her grandchildren, or which day or year it is. I'm just pleased she still knows who I am. I am one of four children, who all work and do not live nearby. We are worried that my dad really cannot cope and mum will have to be sectioned one day. The system doesn't seem to account for this scenario. Whilst we are pleased dementia is now being discussed, it is so frustrating that this side of the disease is not shown. Alex, Elgin Both my grandmother and grandfather suffer from Alzheimer's disease. While discussing increasing funding is good news for those who will develop dementia in the coming decades, much more can and should be done to help family carers who are often unrecognised and ignored. I currently work full time but spend at least 25 hours on top of this caring for both my grandmother and grandfather. Recognition and financial help for part-time carers would go a long way towards reducing costs to the NHS and reducing the social and financial costs to immediate family. I never expected to have to care for my family as a 25-year-old and as a biology graduate I hoped to take the fight to dementia in my career, through research. I feel let down by the government, who should know that many people are having to give up promising careers to care for their relatives. For many, the impending crisis, is all too real now. Edward, Whitstable, Kent More attention and consideration needs to be given to the impact dementia has on carers. I cared for my mother with dementia for several years and it had a substantial impact on me as a carer. During the period I cared for her, I continued to work. It was a demanding, responsible job and the only support provided by my employers was an agreement to progressively reduce my hours to allow me to care for her. In the final two to three years, she was doubly incontinent and I was frequently up at night with her, but still attended work. Any days off as a result of her health and care issues, were usually taken as annual leave, not special leave. There was very little in the way of concessions. During this period there were constant battles with social services for extra care. This frequently resulted in me paying out the same amount for private carers as I earned that day, so I worked effectively for nothing. I managed to eventually succeed in seeking continuing care for my mother, but it was a hollow victory, because a few months later, in March 2008, she died. In her last few months, the carers who had cared for my mother through social services for several years, were prevented from continuing because the contract for the care had to go to another private care company. This distressed my mother in her final months and added to the family's strain. Interviews by Stephen Fottrell. Steve writes: \"We also need to raise awareness of the fact that dementia is now affecting younger people and is not just an older person's disease, as most people think. My partner, who is now in care, was diagnosed with Frontal Temporal Dementia at the age of 37. Two years down the line, she now needs constant care and none of the drugs to help dementia sufferers work for her form of the disease.\" Pauline writes: \"My Mum is a dementia sufferer. I'm hoping the level of care dementia sufferers receive in their home will be addressed at this summit. We are dealing with our second care providers, because the level of care wasn't acceptable with the first one. To say the training is inadequate is a big understatement. The vast majority of the carers have no understanding or knowledge of the condition. We were told we would have regular carers, so my mum could get used to them and the carers get used to her. But, recently we have had 11 different carers in 12 days.\" Alexandra tweets: \"Dementia is my dad sitting in his care home looking at a door waiting for my mum, who died a year ago.\" Helen writes:\"There is not enough help for carers and families of dementia sufferers.\"", "summary": "英国首相卡梅伦周三（11日）宣布，英国将把每年研究痴呆症（dementia ）治疗的科研经费目标从2015年的6600万英镑提高到2025年的1.32亿英镑。"}

There have been anecdotal reports that babies can pick up breast changes, but this has not been accepted as a breast cancer sign by the medical profession. For more from Stoke and Staffordshire Mrs Boyle said her son, who is nearly one, had taken \"fantastically well\" to breastfeeding but his behaviour changed last summer.

There has been no official confirmation of the move. Commercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986 after some whales were driven almost to extinction. For many years Japan has hunted whales for what it calls \"scientific research\" and to sell the meat, a programme widely criticised by conservationists. The Japanese government is expected to cite the recovery of certain whale species as justification for the move, although it's thought to be considering whaling only in its own waters. Officials in Japan say eating whales is part of its culture. A number of coastal communities in Japan have hunted whales for centuries, but consumption in the country surged only after World War Two when whales were the main source of meat. It has plummeted in recent decades. What's the reaction? Wildlife protection groups have already criticised the planned withdrawal. Despite Japanese media widely reporting the decision has been taken, there has been no official announcement yet. Hideki Moronuki, from the Fisheries Agency of Japan, told the BBC that Japan was considering every possible option but has \"not yet come up with a decision\". Citing unnamed government sources, Kyodo news agency said a formal announcement could come next week. In September Tokyo tried to get the IWC to allow commercial catch quotas but the proposal was rejected. What is the current whaling ban? In 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow whale stocks to recover. Pro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas. Instead, it became a quasi-permanent ban. Whaling nations, such as Japan, Norway and Iceland, however argue the practice is part of their culture and should continue in a sustainable way. Today, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while many species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale that Japan primarily hunts - are not. Can Japan just leave? If Japan wants to leave the IWC, it has to send a notification by the end of the year. It would then be able to leave on 30 June 2019. Japan would, however, still be bound by certain international laws. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea binds countries to co-operate on the conservation of whales \"through the appropriate international organisations for their conservation, management and study\". The text does not say which international organisation that is. Japan could either try to set up another international body if it manages to get enough other countries to sign up - or join an existing one like the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco) instead. Like a smaller version of the IWC, Nammco is a grouping of pro-whaling nations - Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands - born out of frustration with the IWC. Hasn't Japan been whaling all along? Yes, Japan has been hunting whales for the past 30 years but under a scientific programme, granted as an exception under the IWC ban. Critics say the practice is a cover for what actually amounts to commercial whaling. It means that whales can be taken for scientific studies and the meat can later be sold for consumption. Japan has caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year, saying it is investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not. Why can't the IWC agree? Japan has repeatedly tried to overturn the moratorium and secure agreement on sustainable catch quotas. The last attempt to do so came in September at an IWC summit in Brazil. Japan offered a package of measures, including setting up a Sustainable Whaling Committee and sustainable catch limits \"for abundant whale stocks/species\". The proposal was voted down. Since then there has been talk of the country simply leaving the body so it will no longer be bound by its rules.", "summary": "日本政府宣布退出国际捕鲸委员会（IWC），并将于2019年7月重启商业捕鲸。此举或将招致国际社会强烈批评。"}

Jo Song-gil, the acting North Korean ambassador to Rome, is the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials. The last senior diplomat to defect was the deputy ambassador in London. Thae Yong-ho abandoned his post in 2016, along with his wife and children. He defected to South Korea. As one of the highest-ranking officials to ever defect from the North, his move was seen as a blow to Kim Jong-un's regime. He would go on to urge the world to spread information in North Korea to undermine Mr Kim's status among his people. Speaking after a briefing from the spy agency on Thursday, Kim Min-ki, a government MP, told reporters that Mr Jo fled the Rome embassy more than a month ago. \"Acting ambassador Jo Song-gil's term was ending in late November last year and he escaped the diplomatic compound in early November,\" the MP said. South Korean's National Intelligence Service, which interrogates all defectors from the North, told lawmakers they had not had any contact from him since then. The agency would not confirm that he is trying to defect to another country. Mr Jo's wife is believed to be with him. Italy's foreign ministry has told the BBC that it has no record of an asylum request made by Mr Jo. Diplomatic sources said the last Italy heard of him was when officials received a note last year from the North Korean government saying that Mr Jo was being replaced. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo has reported that Mr Jo is in a \"safe place\" with his family, citing a diplomatic source. Where is Jo Song-gil? Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul High-profile defections by one of North Korea's elite are rare and would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong-un. State media has often insisted that any defections by diplomats are part of a plot by South Korea or the United States to undermine its government. Pyongyang considers them traitors to the country and its people, and defectors say there can be severe consequences for any family members left behind. The last senior diplomat to defect, Thae Yong-ho, once said that he made his decision as he wanted to give his two sons an education outside the impoverished state. He has told reporters in South Korea that he worked with Jo Song-gil. He claimed that Mr Jo was responsible for delivering luxury goods to North Korea via an Italian company and that he may know more about Pyongyang's nuclear plans. This is the kind of information US intelligence services would be keen to get their hands on. But where is the 48-year-old envoy? Has he asked for asylum? It is unlikely any country will confirm Jo Song-gil's whereabouts until it is clear he and his family are safe. What do we know about Mr Jo? Mr Jo, 48, has been acting ambassador in Rome since October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong-nam in protest over a North Korean nuclear test a month earlier. North Korea's embassy in Italy manages relations with the UN's Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization, which provides important aid to the country. North Korean diplomats stationed abroad usually have to leave several family members behind in Pyongyang to prevent their defection. But Mr Jo is thought to have been in Rome with his wife and children, privileges that suggest his family is influential. Both his father and father-in-law were diplomats. His father-in-law Lee Do-seop was a well-known ambassador to Thailand and Hong Kong, according to Thae Yong-ho. How unusual is this? North Korean representatives overseas are said to be closely watched by their fellow diplomats for any sign of disloyalty to the regime. However several have defected over the past few decades. They include Ko Yong-hwan and Hyon Song-il, who defected to the South in 1991 and 1996 respectively after abandoning their posts in Africa. Jang Sung-gil, a former ambassador to Egypt, took asylum in the US in 1997 with his family, including a brother who was a diplomat working in London. The disappearance of Jo Song-gil comes after a year that saw a dramatic turnaround in relations between North and South Korea, with three meetings held between the countries' leaders. But if Mr Jo has indeed defected, it will not impact inter-Korean relations, \"unless Pyongyang thinks the escape was arranged by South Korean authorities\", Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told the AFP news agency.", "summary": "来自韩国情报机构的消息说，朝鲜驻意大利大使“失踪”。"}

They said a vaccine might be ready for testing in two years but it could be a decade before it is publicly available. Zika, linked to shrunken brains in children, has caused panic in Brazil. Thousands of people have been infected there and it has spread to some 20 countries. The Brazilian President, Dilma Roussef, has urged Latin America to unite in combating the virus. She told a summit in Ecuador that sharing knowledge about the disease was the only way that it would be beaten. A meeting of regional health ministers has been called for next week. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Daniel R Lucey and Lawrence O Gostin say the WHO's failure to act early in the recent Ebola crisis probably cost thousands of lives. They warn that a similar catastrophe could unfold if swift action is not taken over the Zika virus. \"An Emergency Committee should be convened urgently to advise the Director-General about the conditions necessary to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,\" Mr Lucey and Mr Gostin wrote. They added: \"The very process of convening the committee would catalyze international attention, funding, and research.\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday the US government intended to make a more concerted effort to communicate with Americans about the risks associated with the virus. No cure There is no cure for the virus and the hunt is on for a vaccine, led by scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The researchers have visited Brazil to carry out research and collect samples and are now analysing them in a suite of high-security laboratories in Galveston, Texas. Access to the building in Galveston is tightly controlled by police and the FBI. Speaking to the BBC inside the facility, Professor Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, said people were right to be frightened by the virus. \"It's certainly a very significant risk,\" he said, \"and if infection of the foetus does occur and microcephaly develops we have no ability to alter the outcome of that very bad disease which is sometimes fatal or leaves children mentally incapacitated for the remainder of their life.\" The Zika virus was discovered in monkeys in 1947 in Uganda's Zika Forest, with the first human case registered in Nigeria in 1954 but for decades it did not appear to pose much of a threat to people and was largely ignored by the scientific community. It was only with an outbreak on the Micronesian island of Yap in 2007 that some researchers began to take an interest. In the past year the virus \"exploded\" said Prof Weaver, sweeping through the Caribbean and Latin America \"infecting probably a couple of million people\". The symptoms in adults and children are similar to those for dengue fever but generally milder, including flu-like aches, inflammation of the eyes, joint pain and rashes although some people have no symptoms at all. In rare cases the disease may also lead to complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder of the nervous system which can cause paralysis.

The documents include details of almost 7,000 clients based in the UK. HSBC admitted that it was \"accountable for past control failures.\" But it said it has now \"fundamentally changed\". \"We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today,\" it added. The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it is \"co-operating with relevant authorities\". Treasury minister David Gauke defended the government's actions on tax avoidance in the House of Commons after Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood tabled an urgent question. He insisted that the Treasury approach has been \"very successful\", saying it has sought prosecution for \"serial tax evaders\" and raised extra tax revenue. Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The French authorities concluded in 2013 that 99.8% of their citizens on the list were probably evading tax. Joint investigation The thousands of pages of data were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde. In a joint investigation, the documents have now been passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian newspaper, Panorama and more than 50 media outlets around the world. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted. HMRC said £135m in tax, interest and penalties have now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. But the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: \"I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, brave enough, tough enough in securing for the British taxpayer the monies that are due.\" HSBC did not just turn a blind eye to tax evaders - in some cases it broke the law by actively helping its clients. The bank gave one wealthy family a foreign credit card so they could withdraw their undeclared cash at cashpoints overseas. HSBC also helped its tax-dodging clients stay ahead of the law. When the European Savings Directive was introduced in 2005, the idea was that Swiss banks would take any tax owed from undeclared accounts and pass it to the taxman. It was a tax designed to catch tax evaders. But instead of simply collecting the money, HSBC wrote to customers and offered them ways to get round the new tax. HSBC denies that all these account holders were evading tax. 'Dodge liabilities' Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector and author of The Great Tax Robbery, said: \"I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that's what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to dodge their tax liabilities.\" The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. He told Panorama: \"As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.\" HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn Treasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. \"I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity\", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment. But Ms Hodge said: \"Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. \"Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer.\" Verbal messages Meanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007. In a statement, the bank said: \"HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money.\" The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. \"I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly,\" she said. It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.

Ms Antoine, confirming Mr Weber's death in a Facebook post, said he \"never emerged from those depths\". The Manta Resort told the BBC Mr Weber \"tragically drowned while free diving alone outside the underwater room\" on Thursday afternoon. \"It is with the deepest regret that we inform that a fatal accident occurred at The Manta Resort on Thursday 19 September, 2019,\" the resort said in a statement.

They stipulate: Details of the new school food plan were unveiled by ministers in June, following a review of school meals by founders of the Leon food chain John Vincent and Henry Dimbleby. In July 2012, the then-Education Secretary, Michael Gove, asked the restaurateurs to examine nutrition in England's schools and see how it could be improved. The new regulations are in response to those findings and replace ones introduced in the wake of a campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to improve the standard of food in schools. Mr Oliver led a successful campaign to ban junk and processed food from school canteens and tight nutritional guidelines were brought in. However, he expressed frustration at the time that academy schools were exempt from these rules. Academy exemption Under the new school food plan, academies established before 2010 or after June 2014 are obliged to follow the standards set out. But those founded between 2010 and June 2014 remain exempt. The Department for Education said these schools were being encouraged to sign up to the plan voluntarily and hundreds had already done so. The department said the previous rules had done \"much to improve school food\" but \"were complicated and expensive to enforce\". The revised regulations were intended to give school cooks more \"flexibility\", it said. Dr Patricia Mucavele, head of nutrition at the Children's Food Trust, welcomed the new standards, saying variety was key. \"We tested the new standards with the people who would be using them - school caterers and cooks,\" she said. \"They told us the new standards were easier and more intuitive to use to plan interesting and creative menus, which has got to be great news for children and school food.\"", "summary": "下周新学期开始，英格兰中小学的校餐将实行新的健康校餐标准。"}

It closed 3.4% higher, while at the same time the pound traded at $1.33 and €1.20 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the election result meant that the Conservative government \"has been given a powerful new mandate, to get Brexit done\". Mr Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 January. Politically sensitive shares saw sharp rises on UK markets. Shares in water companies such as Severn Trent, which faced the possibility of nationalisation under a Labour government, rose 9%, while UK housebuilders also saw big gains, with Barratt up 14% and Persimmon 12% higher. Shares in banks exposed to the UK economy rose sharply. Barclays, RBS and Lloyds were up 6%, 8% and 5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said housebuilders had been undervalued and rose \"on hopes that construction will benefit from the Conservative victory\". \"We should also consider the potential risk that a Labour government could have posed to their profits being removed,\" Mr Wilson said. While many FTSE 100 shares saw big gains, this was offset slightly by the rise in the value of the pound, which affected companies with big international operations. A rise in sterling cuts the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds. In contrast, the FTSE 250 index - which generally contains firms with more exposure to the domestic economy - jumped more than 5% at one point, before slipping back slightly. The financial bookies had already installed Boris Johnson as the favourite but did not expect him to romp home by such a distance. The pound moved sharply higher as soon as the exit poll was published and went on to post one of its biggest one-day gains against the dollar in years as Johnson's thumping victory removed one layer of political uncertainty.

The Senate Democratic leader has said he has \"very serious doubts\" about Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The court has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues, from abortion to gender to gun control. Mr Trump said Judge Gorsuch had a \"superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to text\". \"Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support,\" Mr Trump said. He was picked from a shortlist of 21 choices, which Mr Trump made public during the election campaign. Accepting the nomination, he said: \"It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.\" Judge Gorsuch is a so-called originalist, meaning he believes the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended. If successful, his nomination will restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court. Protests against Mr Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement. More on this story Where does Judge Gorsuch stand on key issues? Abortion: He has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, making in difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue. Birth control: Judge Gorsuch has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception. In one of his most high-profile cases, he defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance. Gun rights: He hasn't ruled directly on firearms restrictions, but is thought to be generally pro-second amendment. He once wrote in a legal opinion that a citizen's right to bear arms \"must not be infringed lightly\". Euthanasia: He has been vocal about assisted dying, writing a book in 2009 which opposed legalisation. A conservative's dream: Anthony Zurcher, North America Reporter Donald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee is a fairly traditional pick in a decidedly untraditional time. Judge Gorsuch has a CV and background that would make him a natural selection for just about any Republican president. He's the kind of Supreme Court nominee evangelical and traditional conservative voters dreamed of as a reward for sticking with Mr Trump through the general election despite campaign missteps, controversies and occasional political apostasies. They knew they would get a court pick they wouldn't like if Hillary Clinton won. They hoped they would get someone like Judge Gorsuch if Mr Trump prevailed. Meanwhile, Democrats are left fuming over Senate Republicans' precedent-breaking decision to stymie Barack Obama's attempts to fill this court vacancy for nearly 10 months. They have to decide if they will try to derail Mr Gorsuch's nomination as retribution - perhaps forcing Republicans to break with another Senate tradition, the ability of a minority to a block a Supreme Court nominee with only 41 votes through a filibuster. The party's base, feeling a liberal majority on the court was stolen from them, will demand lockstep resistance, likely setting up a divisive confirmation fight ahead. Can Democrats block the nomination? Judge Gorsuch's nomination is expected to spark a political showdown in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama had put forward Judge Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia's death last February. But Republicans refused to debate the choice, saying it was too close to an election, which left Democrats embittered. Even if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote. Democrats may seek to prevent that second vote by prolonging or filibustering the debate. In that case, the nomination would need 60 votes rather than a simple majority. With Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee. Why is the choice so important? The highest court in the US is often the ultimate arbiter on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Each of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. The court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination. It is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and US immigration policy, and possibly on Mr Trump's controversial executive order banning refugees.

It says that senior military leaders have warned the US could \"lose its military-technical superiority in the coming years\" if China leapfrogs it by adopting AI-enabled systems more quickly - for example by using swarming drones to attack the US Navy. \"The DoD [Department of Defense] has long been hardware-oriented toward ships, planes, and tanks [and] is now trying to make the leap to a software-intensive enterprise,\" the report says. \"If our forces are not equipped with AI-enabled systems guided by new concepts that exceed those of their adversaries, they will be outmatched and paralysed by the complexity of battle.\" The report predicts AI will transform \"all aspects of military affairs\", and talks of rival algorithms battling it out in the future. And while it warns that badly-designed AI systems could increase the risk of war, it adds that \"defending against AI-capable adversaries without employing AI is an invitation to disaster\". It does, however, draw the line at nuclear weapons, saying these should still require the explicit authorisation of the president. And it says the White House should press Moscow and Beijing to issue public commitments of their own over this matter. 'Brain drain' The commission began its review in March 2019 and this marks its final report. It says previous warnings about national security threats posed to the US by AI were ignored, but there is still \"a window\" to carry out proposed changes if President Biden and other politicians act with speed. But not all its proposals focus on the military, suggesting that the US's non-defence spending on AI-related research and development be doubled to reach $32bn (£23bn) a year by 2026. Other proposals include: While the members of the commission serve in a personal capacity, many of the companies they work for have bid for Pentagon and other government AI contracts. These include a $10bn deal awarded to Microsoft, which Amazon is challenging in court. Chip limits The report also focuses on the US's need to restrict China's ability to manufacture state-of-the-art computer chips. \"If a potential adversary bests the United States in semiconductors over the long term or suddenly cuts off US access to cutting-edge chips entirely, it could gain the upper hand in every domain of warfare,\" the report states. It advises that the US must keep at least two generations ahead of China's micro-electronics manufacturing capabilities. To do this, it says the government needs to offer large tax credits to companies which build new chip fabrication plants on US soil. And it says export restrictions need to be put in place to prevent China being able to import the photolithography machines required to make the most advanced types of chips with the smallest transistors. This, it says, will require the co-operation of the governments of the Netherlands and Japan, whose companies specialise in these tools. In addition, the report says US firms that export chips to China should be compelled to certify they are not used to \"facilitate human rights abuses\", and should submit quarterly reports to the Department of Commerce listing all chip sales to China. This follows allegations that chips from American firms Intel and Nvidia were used to conduct mass surveillance against China's Uighur ethnic minority in its Xinjiang region. Chip tensions President Biden has already ordered a review of the US semiconductor industry, and last week pledged support for a $37bn plan by Congress to boost local output. Minds are being focused by a current shortage of chips affecting the automobile industry. But China also views the matter as critical to its own ambitions, and earlier on Monday its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology promised to \"vigorously support\" its own chip-makers. Beijing has previously said it wants to produce 70% of locally-used chips by 2025. China's semiconductor-makers have been seeking out second-hand photolithography equipment to do this, buying up as much as 90% of available stock, according to a report in Nikkei Asia. However, these older machines are not capable of producing the most advanced chips, which are prized for use in both the latest smartphones and other consumer gadgets, as well as military applications.", "summary": "一份为美国总统和国会撰写的官方报告称，对于一项在全球禁止人工智能（AI）驱动的自主武器系统的呼吁，美国及其盟友应该说不。"}

And 2% admitted to buying a second home to use that address for a given school. The Policy Exchange said rather than castigating parents who did their best for their children, the focus must be improving teaching in poorer areas. The report, called Parent Power? Using money and information to boost children's chances of educational success, was based on a YouGov survey of 1,173 parents. Analysis of the results by the Sutton Trust found 3% admitted using a relative's address to get their children into a particular school. It found 6% admitted attending church services when they did not previously do so, to get their child into a church school - including 10% of upper-middle-class families surveyed. Professional parents were also more likely to pay for the \"cultural capital\" of weekly music, drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school. More than two-thirds (68%) of professionals did so, compared with 47% of working-class parents and 31% of the lowest income parents. Enrichment activities Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"This research suggests that those with money actively choose to live near good schools, employ tutors and ensure their children have extra lessons and enrichment activities that are often too expensive for other families to afford. \"This provides a significant advantage in school choice and in developing the cultural capital that is so important to social mobility and later success. \"Education is about more than what happens at school, and providing a more level playing field in school choice and out-of-school activities is essential if every child is to achieve his or her potential.\" Sir Peter advocated the introduction of ballots for school admissions so that the best schools are not just for those who can afford to live nearby. Prof Becky Francis, one of the authors of the report, said: \"Our research shows just how far equality of opportunity is being undermined by the greater purchasing power of some parents. \"The ability for some parents but not others to use financial resources to secure their children's achievement poses real impediments for social mobility, which need to be recognised and addressed as detrimental to society.\" Scapegoats But Nick Faith, from the Policy Exchange think tank, said: \"It's not right to stigmatise parents for trying to do the best by their children. \"Instead of making scapegoats of people who are simply attempting to improve the life chances of their kids, the focus should be on driving up the quality of teaching in the poorest areas of the country. \"At the moment a child living in one of the most deprived areas of the UK is a year behind a child from the richest areas in terms of vocabulary development. \"There must be a renewed drive to improve the quality of pre-school teaching, both in nurseries and children's centres. Schools must also encourage all children, regardless of their backgrounds, to reach their full potential. \"These measures, rather than castigating specific groups of parents, will be lead to better educational outcomes for all children.\" Quality information The Sutton Trust report calls on schools to publish socioeconomic data on applications and admissions to encourage \"inclusive practice\". It also says the government should improve the range and quality of information available to working-class parents. And ministers should extend the pupil premium to provide means-tested vouchers to enable working-class parents to offer the extra lessons and cultural activities for their children that other parents take for granted. \"The recommendation would empower families to take ownership of their children's developmental and educational opportunities,\" the report says. More attention should be given to progress and value-added measures in school league tables (in England) so that schools are encouraged to focus on all their students, it adds. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"We want all parents to have the choice of a good local state school. \"That is why we are replacing failing schools with sponsored academies, which are proven to raise standards, opening new free schools where parents want them and introducing a more rigorous curriculum, with qualifications that match the world's best.\" Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"While shocking, the findings of this report come as no surprise. \"English schools have highly uneven intakes. Some schools open their doors to poor and harder to educate children, while others play fast and loose with the admissions code to ensure they get better exam results. \"Until school admissions are properly policed we will continue to have a highly divided and unequal schooling system and society.\"", "summary": "最新研究发现，英格兰大约三分之一（32%）的专业人士会“孟母三迁”，迁往他们认为有好学校的地区。"}

Also announcing plans to use dormant bank accounts to fund projects, Mr Cameron said the concept would be a \"big advance for people power\". Voluntary groups and Labour have queried how the schemes will be funded. The idea was a central theme in the Conservative general election campaign and Mr Cameron denied that he was being forced to re-launch it because of a lack of interest first time around. While reducing the budget deficit was his \"duty\", he said giving individuals and communities more control over their destinies was what excited him and was something that had underpinned his philosophy since he became Conservative leader in 2005. \"There are the things you do because it's your passion,\" he said. \"Things that fire you up in the morning, that drive you, that you truly believe will make a real difference to the country you love, and my great passion is building the big society.\" 'People power' The prime minister said community projects would be established in four parts of the UK - Liverpool; Eden Valley, Cumbria; Windsor and Maidenhead; and the London borough of Sutton - as part of efforts to \"turn government completely on its head\". Each of the project areas - which Mr Cameron said had approached ministers asking to be involved - will be given an expert organiser and dedicated civil servants to ensure \"people power\" initiatives get off the ground. The initiatives being championed include a local buy-out of a rural pub, efforts to recruit volunteers to keep museums open, support to speed up broadband supply, and giving residents more power over council spending. These schemes and others in the future, he said, would represent \"the biggest, most dramatic redistribution of power from elites in Whitehall to the man and woman on the street\". In the past, he said, the talents and initiative of people had been wasted, claiming that over-centralised government had turned public sector workers into the \"weary, disillusioned puppets of government targets\". Mr Cameron acknowledged the transformation he was seeking would not happen overnight and stressed it was not a matter of the government stepping aside and letting people fend for themselves. \"Of course there is not one lever you can simply pull to create a big society,\" he said. \"We should not be naive enough to think that simply if government rolls back and does less, then miraculously society will spring up and do more. \"The truth is we need a government that helps to build a big society.\" As well as encouraging greater volunteering and philanthropy, Mr Cameron confirmed plans to use funds stuck in dormant bank and building society accounts to enable \"some of the most dynamic\" charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to take over the running of public services. It is hoped that hundreds of millions of pounds will eventually be available in start-up funding through a Big Society Bank, to be matched by private investment. 'Cut-price alternative' Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that the plans were \"cover\" for substantial cuts in public services due next year and that the public were either confused by or uninterested in the proposals. \"I don't accept that people don't understand what this is,\" he said. Everyone was aware of the \"great work\" that volunteers were already doing in communities up and down the country, he said, and it was his ambition to simply expand this. \"It is incredibly simple idea and one, I think, is catching on,\" he said. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell called Mr Cameron's speech \"a brass-necked rebranding of programmes already put in place by a Labour government\". She added: \"We welcome the coalition's decision to continue our work in partnership with local communities, but these projects are dependant on funding and resources being put in place. \"It is therefore highly unlikely that civil society will become 'bigger' due to the large public spending cuts that are being put forward by this government.\" Voluntary groups broadly welcomed the idea but expressed concerns about how equipped they were to take on more responsibility, given that public funds were likely to be cut as part of the budget squeeze. \"It is going to be very challenging for them to play a bigger role if they have less resources to do it,\" said Ben Kernighan, from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. And union leaders said public services must be based on certainty of provision and not whether there were enough volunteers on any given day. \"Make no mistake, this plan is all about saving money,\" Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said. \"The government is simply washing its hands of providing decent public services and using volunteers as a cut-price alternative.\"", "summary": "英国首相戴维·卡梅伦（David Cameron）推出“大社会”（Big Society）项目，赋予社区和普通人民更多的参与社会的权力。"}

His lawyer says he is being treated in hospital in northern Liaoning Province after being diagnosed a month ago. His wife Liu Xia has been under house arrest since her husband won the award in 2010 but has never been charged. Liu Xiaobo, 61, was a key leader in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The Chinese authorities have never explained why they have restricted his wife's movements. Mr Liu's brother confirmed the Nobel laureate had been diagnosed with cancer on 23 May, his lawyer Mo Shaoping told the South China Morning Post. He was released days later and is now being treated in the northern city of Shenyang. \"He has no special plans. He is just receiving medical treatment for his illness,\" Mo Shaoping told AFP news agency. A statement from the government in Liaoning said Mr Liu had been released on medical parole and was being treated by eight tumour experts. Fighting for change from within - Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing Most people in China have never heard of Liu Xiaobo due to the censorship of discussion about him here. That it could take a month for news of his release to become public gives you an idea of the level of sensitivity. It also shows that his transfer to hospital by no means guarantees his friends and family will be able to visit. After the brutal crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989 Mr Liu was driven to the front gate of the Australian embassy and an Australian diplomat said that he had to choose in or out. He decided not to leave, believing he could be more effective trying to make change from within. This commitment to a very different China has led to him paying a terrible price. The Nobel committee described Liu Xiaobo as \"the foremost symbol\" of the human rights struggle in China. He never collected his prize and was represented by an empty chair. The Chinese government, which regards him as a criminal, was infuriated by the award. Diplomatic ties with Norway were frozen. Relations were normalised only last December. Mr Liu has three years left to serve of an 11-year sentence for \"inciting subversion\" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. Amnesty International said he should never have been jailed.

A three-year psychology degree will cost £15,000, at a time when many universities are set to charge fees of £9,000 per year. \"The education landscape is changing,\" says principal Carl Lygo. This announcement marks the breaking of new ground for profit-making private providers in higher education. 'Accelerated' courses BPP University College, based in London with branches around the country, is moving beyond its core areas of law, accountancy and business. The university college, one of the few private providers with its own degree-awarding powers, is to provide a BSc psychology degree. There will be an option to take this in an \"accelerated\" form - over two years - with a reduction in fees to £12,000. The other inaugural course will be a BSc in \"nursing diploma to degree\", for registered nurses wanting to \"top up\" to degree level. The fees for this course will be £4,000. \"Over the next decade we will see a different picture emerging, where both students and employers will drive demand for their preferred method of study and training,\" said Mr Lygo. \"We have some exciting growth plans for the next five years, which include expanding into other sectors, increasing our range of programmes and providing highly flexible methods of study,\" he said. BPP University College is distinct within the small group of private higher education providers that can award degrees, as it operates for profit, rather than as a charity or trust. It is also part of a wider US-owned education group. The government announced plans for an expansion of the private sector in universities, but the proposals in the White Paper published last year have not progressed to become legislation.

Mr López Obrador said the official residence, Los Pinos, will become a cultural centre. The Mexican politician is certainly not the first leader to make the statement of lowering his or her salary. It's a populist gesture often used to demonstrate that a leader of a country is in touch with the people, putting distance between themselves and the elite, says Dr Philipp Koeker at the Leibniz University, Hannover, who has studied presidential salaries in Europe. Reality Check has looked at some of the countries where this has happened before. Allowances and expenses mean there can be differences between the official salary and what the prime minister or president actually earns so it's not always easy to know the total income. But there are still significant gaps in the basic salaries of leaders around the world. The Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is said to be the highest earner - paid more than $2m (£1.5m) a year. That amount is tied to the highest salaries in the country's private sector. British Prime Minister Theresa May earns about £150,000 a year, less than German Chancellor Angela Merkel who earns closer to £200,000 whereas Chinese President Xi Jinping is said to earn just $22,000 (£16,600) a year. Who else has taken a pay cut? Uruguay's Jose Mujica in power until 2015, labelled the world's poorest president, gave away 90% of his monthly salary, which was about £7,500. Although many leaders have forgone part of their earnings, they've still enjoyed the exclusive perks of the job. However, Mr Mujica drove an old Volkswagen Beetle and chose to live in a farmhouse instead of the presidential residence. Also in the region, Evo Morales the president of Bolivia, reduced his salary to about £1,000 a month when he took power in 2005. He was fulfilling an election campaign promise. In Bolivia, no public sector employee is allowed to earn more than the president, which meant at the time there were pay reviews across the government. In 2015, the then president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, under fire for the country's widespread economic challenges, ordered mass cuts to government jobs and a 10% reduction to her own salary to about $90,000 (£68,000) a year. A 10% cut to the salaries of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his staff was announced in 2015 amid rising food prices and Western sanctions. Mr Putin declared an income of 18.73m roubles (£226,444) in 2017. More than half of this amount came from the sale of a property in the Moscow area. South Africa's new president Cyril Ramaphosa said he intends to cut his salary in half, which means about £100,000 will be distributed through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. A former businessman and one of South Africa's richest men Mr Ramaphosa reportedly has a fortune of more than $400m. The presidential salary in Nigeria was $70,000 (£53,000) before Muhammadu Buhari and his vice president agreed to a 50% pay cut at the beginning of his term in 2015. Going back further, in the 1980s the former president of Burkina Faso Thomas Sankara took a monthly wage of $450 and banned the use of chauffeur-driven cars and first class airline tickets by his ministers, according to the Guardian. Who doesn't take a salary? The current Slovakian president, Andrej Kiska, who entered politics a rich man, donates his entire salary to a charity. In 2013, the Slovakian president had received a monthly salary of more than $9,000 (£6,800). It was the highest in central and eastern Europe at the time, according to an analysis by Dr Koeker. Donald Trump has followed in the footsteps of other US presidents by donating most of his salary to charity and only taking $1 a year. Herbert Hoover and John F Kennedy made the same symbolic gesture. American presidents earn about $400,000 (£320,000) a year. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told journalists at a news conference in March 2017 that Mr Trump wanted the help of the media to decide where the salary should be donated.

But the office said it had determined Covid-19 \"was not manmade or genetically modified\". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. What did Trump say? At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: \"Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?\" \"Yes, I have. Yes, I have,\" said the president, without specifying. \"And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.\" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: \"I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.\" He also told reporters: \"Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? \"I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.\" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News. What did the intelligence service say? In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the \"wide scientific consensus\" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. \"The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. What is the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. What are Trump's accusations against China? Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before? In January, he called US intelligence agencies \"naive\" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens. The right moment for this fight? President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）在周四白宫记者会上表示，他看到过新冠病毒起源于中国实验室的证据。这一言论被指与美国情报机构的说法不符。"}

The cause of the cargo ship malfunction has yet to be determined. The initial planned launch of the spacecraft on Monday was delayed due to a yacht in the surrounding danger zone. The flight was expected to be the third contracted mission with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The rocket was due to carry nearly 5,000lb (2,200kgs) of supplies to six astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It included equipment for astronauts to conduct tests on blood flow to the human brain and to analyse meteors. There was also equipment for experiments to examine the growth of pea shoots in orbit and how the body's immune system reacts to space travel. More than 1,300lb (600kg) of food was on board, including pre-packaged meals and freeze-dried crab cakes. \"We will understand what happened, hopefully soon, and we'll get things back on track,\" said Frank Culbertson, executive vice-president of Orbital Sciences. \"We've all seen this happen in our business before, and we've all seen the teams recover from this, and we will do the same.\" No-one was injured, said Mr Culbertson, and an investigation team was going through the data to try to establish the cause. He added it was possible his company's staff had triggered the rocket's destruct mechanism after the launch went wrong, but that he was not certain. Investigating the crash The examination of debris around the site would begin on Wednesday morning, Mr Culbertson said. But he urged locals to avoid the crash area as the rocket had been carrying \"hazardous materials\". \"Certainly don't go souvenir hunting along the beach,\" he said. Antares rocket Medium expendable launcher + 5,000 kg payload capacity First flew: 2013 Stages: 2 Height*: 41.9 m First-stage thrust: 734,000 lbs Russia's space agency conducted its own launch to the ISS on Wednesday. The operation, which by chance was on the same day as the Antares launch, was planned long before Wednesday's accident, officials said. Investigators will not jump to conclusions but one line of inquiry will surely focus on the AJ-26 engines used to lift the rocket away from the pad, says BBC science correspondent Jonathan Amos. \"These are actually modified Russian-built power units that were originally developed for the ill-fated Soviet Moon rocket, the N-1. \"They have been refurbished to modern standards, but one blew up in ground testing earlier this year.\" Analysis: Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent This new rocket was part of Nasa's effort to contract out \"routine\" cargo resupply to the International Space Station. But if we needed reminding that nothing in space is routine then this explosion has brought that message home in spectacular fashion. The US space agency \"seeded\" development of Antares - and the supply ship it launches, Cygnus - by giving incentive payments to manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation, to help them develop a low-cost, commercial follow-on to fill the cargo gap left by the retired space shuttles. The blast is likely to have seriously damaged the launch pad and support infrastructure, meaning that even if the fault is quickly identified and corrected, restarting Antares flights again may take a long time. However, there should be no immediate threat to supplies for astronauts on the space station. The Cygnus cargo ship that was on top of the Antares is one of a fleet of vehicles that are used in this role. These other robotic vessels, launched atop other rockets, will now have to pick up the slack. There is no doubting the explosion is a major setback for Orbital Sciences Corporation, and its plans to market Antares as a multi-purpose, commercial launcher. Confidence always takes a hit in the wake of a failure. But Orbital has the expertise to come back - as it has done after previous launch failures.", "summary": "美国向国际太空站运送补给物资的无人驾驶运载火箭在弗吉尼亚发射升空后爆炸。"}

Mr Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Germany's governing coalition and Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy, told a news conference that as a result, the world now regarded Europe as an unstable continent. 'Deep trouble' \"Brexit is bad but it won't hurt us as much economically as some fear - it's more of a psychological problem and it's a huge problem politically,\" he said. \"If we organise Brexit in the wrong way, then we'll be in deep trouble, so now we need to make sure that we don't allow Britain to keep the nice things, so to speak, related to Europe while taking no responsibility.\" Mrs Merkel has met a number of European leaders during the past week to prepare the ground for a September summit focused on the EU's future post-Brexit. She has said remaining member states must listen to each other carefully and avoid rushing into policy decisions. Meanwhile, Mrs May is due to begin drawing up blueprints for Brexit on Wednesday, when she hosts cabinet ministers at Chequers, the prime minister's country retreat in Buckinghamshire. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May would hear different answers to the question \"what does Brexit actually mean?\" from around the cabinet table and in Parliament. Trade talks It comes as a new cross-party group called Open Britain was launched. In a joint article for the group in the Sunday Times, three former ministers from the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats accept that the free movement of people cannot continue, but they warn against \"pulling up the drawbridge.\" Mr Gabriel also said on Sunday that trade talks between the EU and the US had \"de facto failed\". The plan - known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP - aimed to remove or reduce a wide range of barriers to EU-US trade and investment. However, the move has been controversial in many of countries involved, including Germany and the UK. Critics say TTIP is driven by big business and would be bad for jobs, consumers and the environment. In 14 rounds of talks, the two sides had not agreed on a single common chapter out of 27 being discussed, Mr Gabriel said. \"In my opinion the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it,\" said Mr Gabriel. 'Don't submit' He suggested Washington was angry about a deal the EU struck with Canada, because it contained elements the US does not want to see in the TTIP. \"We mustn't submit to the American proposals,\" said Mr Gabriel, who is head of Germany's centre-left Social Democratic Party, which is in coalition with Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union. The BBC's Andrew Walker said ending the negotiations would not be a decision for Mr Gabriel, as he is the leader of centre-left Social Democratic Party, which is in coalition with Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union. Nonetheless, Mr Gabriel is an important voice and his view that TTIP has in effect failed is a sign of just how much political difficulty it faces, our correspondent added. He has also been forced to defend his actions after he flicked the middle finger to a group of right-wing protesters earlier this month. Sigmar Gabriel said his only mistake was not using both hands, and told his critics to think about what they would do if faced with 12 \"young, aggressive, swearing and ready-for-violence Nazis\". Mr Gabriel had been confronted by the hecklers in northern Germany.", "summary": "德国副总理西格玛尔·加布里尔警告说，英国脱离欧洲联盟过程要是处置不当，整个欧盟前途都将变得不明朗。"}

But vaccinations have been much slower. Health officials will start inoculating medical staff in hospitals and care homes later this week. The aim is to give some 800,000 people the jab over the next month using vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. In an interview one year since he became the country's coronavirus figurehead, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun defended the later rollout and said it allowed South Korean officials to see how the vaccine had fared elsewhere. \"You know that Koreans are the master of speed,\" said Mr Chung. \"It's not an easy goal to achieve but we aim to complete the first set of vaccinations on 70% of our population by the end of the third quarter in September. I believe it's possible.\" The government has procured more than enough vaccine for the country's 55 million people, but most of these supplies are not expected to arrive until around July. That gives health workers just a few months to meet the government's deadline. Seoul had hoped to have its own vaccine ready by the end of this year - but that is now looking unlikely. The hope of a \"home-grown\" jab is thought to be part of the reason the government took its time to negotiate with vaccine companies for supplies. It eventually secured contracts with Pfizer and Moderna at the end of January but not before domestic media had lambasted its approach as too relaxed. President Moon Jae-in told me at his New Year press conference that he did not regret taking the time to get this right. But the past few months has allowed time for fear to set in. South Korea is not traditionally a country that shuns mass vaccinations. Its inoculation rate for major diseases such as hepatitis B are usually higher than those of the United States, the UK and Australia. But a recent poll by the Korea Society Opinion Institute found that only around 45% of those asked were willing to get the Covid-19 vaccination when their turn comes in the next few months. Another 45% said they wanted to delay getting their shots to \"watch the situation\". Five per cent said they would refuse to be vaccinated. Prime Minister Chung believes people will be persuaded. \"Sure, some may resist getting vaccinated but this government will encourage more people to get the jab... If the vaccine proves to be as effective as promised and if indeed herd immunity is achieved when 70% are inoculated - then by this fall Koreans may have their normal life back.\" The lure of a more normal life may prove a compelling argument. South Korea has so far managed to control the virus and live with Covid-19 without a major nationwide lockdown. But there are restrictions in place. Restaurants and small businesses in and around the capital Seoul have had a curfew of 21:00 since December. That has now been extended by an extra hour, and as winter gives way to spring, Seoul's streets are busy. Coffee shops and bars are bustling and even nightclubs have reopened for the young - and old. Health officials announced on Monday that there had been a cluster of infections at a seniors' disco. Over-confidence in its own measures and a touch of complacency have led to three waves of the virus. In December, daily case numbers rose to more than 1,000. Still low by international standards, but it was a wake-up call in South Korea. Prime Minister Chung said he was keen to strike a balance between the economy and preventing infection. \"I believe it is better to minimise restrictions. But we have to keep in mind that if we fail to contain Covid-19 we will fail to grow our economy as well. Yes, at the moment the fight against the coronavirus is a priority but it is not the only fight. \"We are preparing to amend our social distancing measures in March. The focus will be to reduce the burden on those self-employed or small businesses that have been badly hit by the restrictions while asking each individual to be more responsible and carry out some restraint.\" It's not clear what that will mean in practice, but currently there is a ban on more than four people gathering together. South Korea's fight against the coronavirus has not been perfect, but it has saved lives. Just over 1,500 people have died from Covid-19 and there have been a total of around 87,000 infections in the past year. So was Mr Chung surprised when those in the West failed to follow this country's lead? \"South Korea has learned about democracy and gained technology from advanced countries like Europe and the UK. \"I would never have thought they would have suffered so much from Covid-19. South Korea was focused on the three principles of testing, tracking and tracing the virus and the three values of democracy, transparency and openness - we didn't realise how well we were doing. \"It was only later that we learned we were managing better than others around the world.\"", "summary": "韩国总理告诉BBC，尽管韩国的新冠疫苗接种计划起步较晚，但韩国将在2021年秋季实现群体免疫。"}

The firm said it expected sales to fall again in the fourth quarter to between $45.5bn (£34bn; €41.4bn) and $47.5bn. Demand for Apple's flagship product has been slowing since the second quarter when the firm reported the first drop in iPhone sales since their 2007 launch. The iPhone makes up for around two-thirds of Apple's sales and accounts for even more of its profits. The slowdown in iPhone sales sent profit down 27% to $7.8bn in the three months to 25 June, while revenues fell 14.6% to $42.4bn. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - plunged 33%. The firm blamed economic uncertainty and people not upgrading their phones as often for the drop. China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. \"It is very clear that there are some signs of economic slowdown in China, and we will have to work through them. \"We understand China well and we remain very, very optimistic about the future there,\" said Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri. Apple shares surge Results were also hit by the impact of a stronger dollar. Nonetheless, shares, which have fallen almost 20% over the past year, rose over 7% in after-hours trading because the firm's overall performance was not as bad as analysts had expected. Mr Maestri said comparisons to the second quarter last year, when iPhone 6 sales surged 35%, made its performance seem worse than it was. He also pointed to its services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and other services, as a bright spot. The division made nearly $6bn in revenue, up 18.9% from the same time last year, and is now the firm's second-largest sales generator after the iPhone.

Russia's central bank has tried unsuccessfully to stabilise the currency, buying roubles in the markets and raising its main lending rate to 10.5%.

Life expectancy rates in Winchester were also higher than the national average, with men in the city expected to live to about 82 and women to about 85. Crime rates in the city were also found to be among the lowest in the country. Hart in Hampshire - a former winner of the annual study over the past five years - fell to 26.

The EU has made the move a condition for it to sign a historic deal on closer ties with Ukraine this month. But Ukraine has come under intense pressure from Russia not to sign. Russia wants Ukraine to join its own customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus, which it sees as a prototype rival to the European Union. Ukraine's President, Viktor Yanukovych, made a secretive visit to Moscow at the weekend. Too late? MPs said on Wednesday that attempts between the government and opposition to finalise a bill allowing convicts to receive medical treatment abroad had failed. The bill was meant to allow Tymoshenko to be handed over for medical treatment in Germany. The former prime minister, and long time bitter rival of President Yanukovych, has been serving a seven-year jail term since being convicted of abuse of power in 2011 over a controversial gas deal with Russia. Wednesday's parliamentary session was closed without a vote taking place, leading to cries of \"Shame!\" from the pro-EU opposition. The speaker said a new session would take place next Tuesday, 19 November. It was unclear whether that would be too late for the EU, as its foreign ministers are scheduled to decide at a meeting on Monday whether the deal with Ukraine can be signed at a summit in Vilnius at the end of the month. Other bills demanded by the EU, including one on electoral reform, also failed to come to a vote during Wednesday's session. The parliamentary leader of Tymoshenko's opposition Fatherland group, MP Arseniy Yatsenyuk, blamed the president's ruling Party of the Regions for the failure of the bill, and said it was deliberately trying to destroy the EU deal. \"They are hindering Ukraine's movement towards the European Union,\" he said. But the Party of the Regions blamed the opposition for failing to co-operate in talks on the bill. 'Stab in the heart' Ukrainian and EU negotiators have been working for eight years on the historic association and free trade agreement, which would bestow upon Kiev major benefits such as eventually removing import tariffs. The pact is a key step on the way to prospective full EU membership. EU monitors are in Ukraine and were hoping to witness the vote before issuing a progress report on Wednesday night. The EU has been attempting to build closer relations with neighbours that were once part of the Soviet Union, and is expected to initial but not yet formally sign association agreements with Georgia and Moldova. Tymoshenko on Tuesday accused President Yanukovych of seeking to undermine the country's EU aspirations. \"Yanukovych wants to convince European leaders that their efforts to protect Ukraine against dictatorship are futile, and they have to give up and retreat,\" she said in a statement read by her daughter. And she said the arrest of her own lawyer, Serhiy Vlasenko, on suspicion of domestic violence on Tuesday, was \"the last stab\" in the heart of closer relations with the EU.

Mr Lavrov was speaking after meeting his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US. On Thursday, President Putin suggested the Syrian regime could be ready to work with some rebel groups against the so-called Islamic State. Mr Putin said President Assad had agreed to the idea on a recent visit to Moscow, Speaking at the start of talks in Vienna on Friday, Mr Lavrov said: \"Our common position is that we need to boost efforts for the political process in the Syrian settlement. \"This foresees the start of full-scale talks between representatives of the Syrian government and the full spectrum of the Syrian opposition, both domestic and external - with the support of outside players.\" Mr Lavrov did not define exactly which opposition groups should be included. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also attended, said the talks had been \"constructive\" and that an expanded round of negotiations could take place next week. The US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia all support rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. Russia backs President Assad and hosted him on Tuesday in a visit criticised by the US. Russia has been bombing targets in Syria since last month. It says it is primarily hitting IS, but Western powers say most of the air strikes have hit rebel groups, including those backed by the West and Gulf states. 'Successful offensive' However, Vladimir Putin's spokesman said on the BBC's HARDtalk programme that Russia's intervention in Syria was not an attempt to prop up President Assad but rather an attempt to save the country and the region from falling under the sway of terrorists. Dmitry Peskov said a political settlement was impossible without dialogue with the \"legitimate president\" of Syria. And he echoed Mr Putin's speech at the Valdai discussion forum by saying all the \"serious\" rebel forces in Syria were \"terrorists\". Mr Peskov said the West had so far failed to identify any \"balanced opposition\" to Mr Assad that did not have links to jihadists. The US-led air campaign against the so-called Islamic State had led to IS controlling two-thirds of the country's territory, Mr Peskov argued, but there were now signs the Syrian army - backed by Russian air strikes - was mounting a successful offensive against rebels. Mr Peskov also said Russia wanted to exchange military information with the US, including about targets of air strikes, but this had not been forthcoming. Controversial weapon - Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic and defence correspondent YouTube video from the fighting in Syria has thrown up images of a rarely seen Russian weapons system - the TOS-1 \"Buratino\" multiple rocket launcher. Described by the Russians as a \"heavy flame-thrower\", it is a highly controversial weapon and its appearance in Syria raises the question as to who is actually operating it. The TOS-1 fires a 220mm rocket that is designed to carry a thermobaric warhead. Sometimes known as a \"fuel-air explosive\" the rockets detonates at a set altitude above the ground, releasing a cloud of fuel which is then ignited by a second explosion. This creates a huge temperature and pressure wave whose impact has been likened to a low-yield nuclear explosive. It is very much an indiscriminate weapon, typically used to support offensive operations by blanketing given areas with fire. Thermobaric weapons were used to devastating effect by the Russians in Afghanistan. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. What's the human cost? More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.", "summary": "叙利亚的盟友俄罗斯表示，应该举行叙利亚政府和“全部”反对派之间的谈判。"}

She was appointed in July, just two months after the king married Queen Suthida, his fourth wife. Sineenat, who was a major-general and is a trained pilot, nurse and bodyguard, was the first person to be awarded the title of Royal Noble Consort in nearly a century. Queen Suthida - a 41-year-old former flight attendant and deputy head of his bodyguard unit - is King Vajiralongkorn's long-term partner and has been seen with him in public for many years. The announcement that Sineenat had been stripped of her titles was published in the Royal Gazette on Monday. It marked a sudden fall from grace for the royal consort, who for several years was seen often at the side of King Vajiralongkorn. Even after the king's marriage to Queen Suthida, Sineenat was a regular guest at royal events. What did the palace say? The statement published on Monday said Sineenat had \"shown resistance and pressure in every manner to stop the appointment of the Queen\" ahead of the coronation in May. \"The king gave her a royal consort position, in hopes of relieving the pressure and a problem that could affect the monarchy,\" the statement said. It also accused the royal consort of \"resistance against the king and the queen\" and of abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf. The king, the statement said, had learnt \"she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status\". He ordered her stripped of all royal titles, decorations, status in the royal guard and her military ranks. King Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne after the death of his father in 2016. What about the king's wives? He has had four wives - Princess Soamsawali from 1977 to 1993; Yuvadhida Polpraserth from 1994 to 1996; Srirasmi Suwadee between 2001 and 2014; and Queen Suthida. The true cause of Sineenat's removal as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. The nation's lese-majeste law forbids any insult of the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world. The removal of Sineenat echoes the cases of two of the King's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her. In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from court. Her 14-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland.

The senior has been interning at a Beaumont rescue centre which is home to about 450 alligators, crocodiles and other reptiles. But it's Big Tex that steals the show - a gargantuan alligator who was adopted in 2016 after overfeeding turned him into a nuisance for local boats. Makenzie and Tex have developed a special relationship since she joined the centre in May. She says he responds to his name and reacts to her hand signals when she regularly enters his pond to feed him. \"I get in the water with that animal every day - he's one of my best friends there!\" she tells the BBC, shrugging off a question about being scared. The 21-year-old grew up in Bellevue, Nebraska where spotting an alligator in your garden is not the ordinary occurrence she now deals with every day. \"Starting from a young age I was always picking up snakes, holding animals, talking to kids and educating the public,\" she says of her love of wildlife. She initially intended the graduation snaps to serve as a showcase for the work she has been doing this summer. \"In all reality we don't want to bring these animals back, we want them to live in the bayous and canals out in the swampy areas,\" she says about the Gator Country centre, where she works. \"But since he is with us, he's a wonderful representation of what it's like to train an animal and show off his personality.

Always treat with caution Analysis by Simon Pooley, reptile expert at Birkbeck University Alligators do seem to be temperamentally less aggressive towards people than some of the larger crocodiles, but if an animal that size wants to kill you, it can. An alligator can learn to know and trust somebody like this under certain conditions over time, but it's not something you can do with any gator. Putting a hand in or near a croc's mouth is often the idiotic thing to do because it can trigger a feeding reflex. This particular alligator has been captured, kept in captivity and well fed. It's developed a relationship with Makenzie but someone else shouldn't just get into the water with Big Tex. People tend to think of crocs and alligators as stupid, but the intelligence and memory of these animals are underestimated. When alligators have been trained in captivity they're really smart and quick to learn. It's much rarer to have these relationships with wild crocodiles or alligators, and no-one should feel blasé about getting into the water with a gator.

'Beating China' Disagreements between China and the US have been growing in recent times and the two have sparred over issues ranging from China's currency policies to allegations of state subsidies given to Chinese firms. The US has upped its ante against Beijing recently, not least because of the upcoming presidential elections. The impact of China's growing economic might on the US economy, and how the US should respond to it, has become a key issue in the elections. Both President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to put more pressure on Beijing. If elected, Mr Romney has vowed to formally label China a \"currency manipulator\" on his first day in office, opening the way to trade sanctions. Last month, Mr Obama filed a complaint against China with the WTO, accusing it of illegally subsidising car exports. That was in addition to two other complaints the Obama administration has filed with the WTO against China this year. The first accused Beijing of restricting its exports of so-called rare earth metals, used to make high-tech devices. The second accused Beijing of unfairly imposing anti-dumping duties on US cars exported to China, making them more expensive to buy. The US alleged that the move was designed to protect Chinese manufacturers. But despite these actions, Mr Romney has accused Mr Obama of being too soft on China.

Papers released under the 30-year rule show Mrs Thatcher was acutely worried about retaking the islands. One historian said the documents were among the \"most powerful material\" declassified in the last three decades. In October 1982, a few months after the war ended, Mrs Thatcher gave evidence behind closed doors to the Falkland Islands Review Committee, chaired by Lord Franks. The transcript of that dramatic testimony has now been published for the first time. \"I never, never expected the Argentines to invade the Falklands head-on. It was such a stupid thing to do, as events happened, such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing\", Mrs Thatcher told the Franks Committee. There had been some British contingency planning in the month before the Argentine invasion of the Falklands. On 26 March 1982, Ministry of Defence officials came back to Mrs Thatcher with a plan to deter a full-scale invasion. One sentence shocked her, and she wrote it in her diary: \"Moreover, if faced with Argentine occupation on arrival there would be no certainty that such a force would be able to retake the dependency.\" She told the committee: \"You can imagine that turned a knife in my heart, that lot.\" However, in her oral evidence, she said she had still considered an invasion unlikely: \"I again stress, I thought that they would be so absurd and ridiculous to invade the Falklands that I did not think it would happen. \"Nevertheless, one has always to make contingency plans, and soon after we got the South Georgia incident happening.\" The picture changed on 31 March 1982 when Mrs Thatcher was shown intelligence suggesting that an invasion was on the cards: \"I just say it was the worst I think moment of my life.\" She also told the committee: \"That night no-one could tell me whether we could retake the Falklands - no-one. We did not know - we did not know.\" The British foreign secretary at the time, Lord Carrington, also gave evidence to the Franks Committee, where he too held the view that Argentina was not going to invade the Falklands. \"I have been accused, and was accused violently after 2 April in the House of Commons, and in the press and elsewhere - of wilfully ignoring signs and statements and evidence, and just ignoring it. I can truthfully say I did not do any of these things… they (the signs of an invasion) were not there,\" Lord Carrington said. On 5 April, Lord Carrington resigned as foreign secretary, which prompted this reaction from Mrs Thatcher: \"I had tremendous confidence in Peter Carrington, and his loss seemed to me a devastating blow for Britain and I would back him up all the way.\" The political historian Lord Hennessy said Mrs Thatcher's evidence about the Falklands War was some of the most powerful material to be declassified by the National Archives in the last three decades. \"It's only three months after the end of the war, so it's immensely vivid. It's still coursing through her veins. \"She also has this great power of expression - she's a primary colours politician.\" Argentina's invasion of the Falklands may have come as a surprise to Mrs Thatcher and her ministers, but the government papers do reveal some interesting pointers. As early as 1977 there was a British intelligence assessment that Argentine military action was possible if talks over the Islands went badly. At the end of that year, the British government decided to send a submarine and two frigates to the South Atlantic. However, the ships' movements were kept secret. Indeed, there was no conspicuous British naval presence in the South Atlantic in the five years that preceded the war. This may be why Argentina thought Britain would not launch an attack to retake the Falklands in April 1982. Also, Britain's ambassador in Buenos Aires in 1982, Anthony Williams, felt some of his warnings sent to London were simply ignored. \"Argentina is not just another 'banana republic' - a tin pot country led by a tinpot dictator,\" he wrote in his valedictory despatch in June 1982. \"Argentina has its share of vandals, hooligans and roughs. But this is not the whole story, nor was the seizure of the islands a simple act of brigandage.\" Lord Armstrong was Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet secretary at the time. He told the BBC: \"If we had failed to recover the Falklands she would have had to go. \"If we had lost it she couldn't have won the next election. Her own political career, and that of her party, were on the line. \"During those weeks, she lived more fully and more completely than at any time in the rest of her time as prime minister.\" Argentine forces landed on the islands in 2 April 1982 and the recapture by a British task force was completed on 14 June. Argentina says it inherited ownership of the islands - which it calls Las Malvinas - from Spain, arguing that British colonists occupied the islands by force in 1833 and expelled settlers - thus violating Argentina's territorial integrity. It also bases its claim on the islands' proximity to the South American mainland. Some 255 British servicemen and three Falklands civilians died during the conflict. The number of Argentine dead is estimated at about 650 All document images courtesy of the National Archives", "summary": "解密的英国政府文件显示，1982年阿根廷军队入侵福克兰群岛事件使当时的首相撒切尔夫人猝不及防。"}

It said the Chinese government was using the expertise of \"civilian entities\", such as companies and universities, to modernise its military capabilities. SMIC has denied any military links. The company now falls under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in November, which sought to prevent US capital from funding the modernisation of China's military. SMIC has previously said some of its US suppliers have been issued with letters telling them they will be subject to new export restrictions. This suggests the US Department of Commerce may add the company to its trade blacklist, known as the entity list, although it has not yet published such a decision. If that happens, it could have a significant impact on chip production. \"Seeing as SMIC is dependent on sourcing from US companies in order to be able to manufacture silicon chips, this puts SMIC's business in the hands of the Department of Commerce, which can decide whether to issue licences on a case-by-case basis,\" said Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile. \"The added designation of SMIC as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military does not change the situation, other than to make it harder to get a licence, make it more likely to be added to the entity list and result in diminished demand for its shares as US investors will no longer be able to buy them.\" This is another sign that the Trump administration intends to use its final days to continue to crank up pressure on China and try and lock in a hard-line policy for the incoming Biden administration. The definition of what constitutes supporting the military may be interpreted broadly and is open to dispute - but Washington is using it as a lever in the battle over chips - a key area of technological competition. Washington knows this is one area that China is relatively behind in and is desperate to catch up on. The Trump administration will also be counting on it being hard for a Biden administration to be seen to roll back measures for fear of being accused of going \"soft\" on Beijing. Restrictions SMIC was founded in 2000, and has since become the most prominent chip-making foundry in mainland China. However, its most advanced products are said to lag two generations behind what rival manufacturers - including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and South Korea's Samsung - are capable of. SMIC cannot currently make transistors as small as are made by those rivals, so it cannot produce state-of-the-art processors for the latest smartphones and other advanced gadgets. The reason for this is, in part, due to existing restrictions the US has imposed on the firm. At present, the only way to make the most advanced logic chips is to use equipment made by a Dutch company, ASML. SMIC had ordered a $150m (£111m) lithography machine - which uses lasers focused by giant mirrors to print minuscule patterns on silicon - from ASML in 2018. But Reuters reported the White House convinced the Dutch government to block the export on security grounds. A spokesman for ASML declined to comment when asked by the BBC whether the deal was still in limbo. SMIC has told the BBC: \"SMIC manufactures semiconductors and provides services solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses. The company has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for any military end-users or end-uses.\"", "summary": "美国国防部周四（12月3日）将中国最大的芯片制造商中芯国际（SMIC) 列入“中国军方企业”（Chinese military companies）名单。此举意味着美国投资者被禁止持有或交易中芯国际股票。"}

The \"unprecedented\" arrangement between the two countries was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron ahead of talks with US President Barack Obama. The two men discussed a range of other issues, including counter-terrorism. They are holding a press conference in the Oval Office of The White House after talks lasting about an hour. Mr Cameron has previously said in relation to cyber attacks that there should be no \"means of communication\" which \"we cannot read\". He is expected to talk to the US president about getting companies such as Google and Facebook to allow governments to view encrypted messages. 'Modern threat' In terms of the planned cyber war games Downing Street said they will aim to improve the flow of information between the US and UK about threats. No 10 said agents will co-operate in \"cyber cells\", involving MI5 and the FBI, and they will be the first the UK has established with another country. Speaking to BBC political editor Nick Robinson after arriving in Washington on Thursday night for a two-day visit, Mr Cameron said cyber attacks were \"one of the big modern threats that we face\". The first war game will involve the Bank of England and commercial banks, targeting the City of London and Wall Street, and will be followed by \"further exercises to test critical national infrastructure\", Downing Street said. Money will also be made available to train \"the next generation\" of cyber agents. Analysis by Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The tensions and confusions over what cyber security means are all too apparent this week. Is it about defending corporate networks against hostile attackers of the type who targeted Sony? That's the focus of today's announcements about war-gaming and threat cells. Or is it about getting hold of data and communications about terrorists? That seemed to be the focus earlier in the week, with briefings that the visit would focus on getting US companies to be more helpful in providing data to British authorities. The two are different in focus and it is not yet clear how much progress on the latter the prime minister will make with a president whose relations with the tech sector are already difficult post-Snowden. There is also some tricky overlap between the two fields, for instance on how far information should be encrypted so it cannot be read or stolen. Encryption may foil foreign cyber spies but also stymie law enforcement. The measures come in the wake of the recent hacking of Sony Pictures' computers and the US military's Central Command's Twitter feed, where comments were posted promoting Islamic State (IS) militants. The cyber attack on Sony Pictures led to data being leaked from its computers exposing emails and personal details about staff and stars. The hackers, who called themselves #GOP or Guardians of Peace, also threatened cinema chains planning to screen Sony's satirical North Korea comedy, The Interview, the plot of which involves a bid to assassinate the country's leader Kim Jong-un. Sony initially cancelled the film's release after leading US cinema groups said they would not screen it, a move which Mr Obama later described as \"a mistake\". Mr Obama has said cyber threats were an \"urgent and growing danger\" and unveiled domestic proposals to strengthen the law. The UK's National Audit Office warned in 2013 that a lack of skilled workers was hampering the fight against cyber crime. Mr Cameron said the UK was already prepared for a cyber attack, saying GCHQ had \"massive expertise\", but added more needed to be done. He said: \"We need to be able in extremis to interrupt the contact between terrorists. \"It's also about protecting people's data, people's finances - these attacks can have real consequences to people's prosperity.\" 'Beef up filters' The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said there had been a lot of concern over Mr Cameron's inference that governments should be able to view encrypted data. He said not only were civil rights groups worried, but major players in the technology industry said banning encrypted messages could harm British trade if UK companies were seen to be not private. Our correspondent also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that smaller social networking sites were just as well used by potential hackers as the well-known ones. He said he had found an example of an exchange on the site Ask.fm which appeared to be from an IS fighter asking another user which country he should go to for weapons training. In relation to the site being used for this type of communication Doug Leeds, the chief executive of Ask.com, which owns Ask.fm, said: \"We have taken some action, and we're looking to take more, what we have done so far is beef up our filters to try and look for patterns that would suggest that this is going on.\" Howard Schmidt, a former eBay and Microsoft executive, told the BBC attitudes around privacy and the right to encrypt personal data were still hotly debated in the US in light of the revelations disclosed by fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden. Among other things, Snowden's leaks detailed the National Security Agency's practice of harvesting data on millions of telephone calls made in the US and around the world, and revealed the CIA intelligence agency had snooped on foreign leaders. A recent report by GCHQ, the UK government's communications security agency, on the issue of cyber attacks said that more than 80% of large UK companies experienced some form of security breach in 2014, and attacks were on the rise.", "summary": "英美两国即将开展针对网络犯罪的新防御合作计划，包括“战争游戏”演习，模拟对彼此进行网络攻击。"}

So here's how a US-China trade war could hurt us. Tit-for-tat A list of Chinese products will be hit with a 25% tariff from Friday - effectively making them 25% more expensive for US consumers. What the US really wants to target though are things produced under China's Made in China 2025 policy. In retaliation to the US moves, China has hit these sectors: 'Getting scary' And while Beijing is really good at the chest-thumping, fist-wagging rhetoric, the reality on the ground is much more serious. \"Our industry contacts in China have said things like 'seems pretty serious,' or 'this is getting scary', even 'I think there's a chance of things getting worse',\" says Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research. He's recently returned from a trip to the mainland, and as part of his research routinely talks to China-based firms to gauge business sentiment there. These worries, he says, can translate into \"increased caution and lower confidence\" for businesses as they try to navigate the uncertainty ahead. Which means: expansion plans could be put on ice. And if Chinese expansion is on hold that has a direct impact on the rest of us in Asia. Shift manufacturing? Obviously the US and China's economies are most at risk, although they're not the only ones. According to DBS's chief economist Taimur Baig, an all-out trade war could shave 0.25% off the GDP of both economies this year. It gets much worse next year - with both countries seeing a reduction in growth of about 0.5% or more. Mr Baig adds that \"considering China grows at 6-7% and the US at 2-3%, we believe the damage would be greater to the US than on China\". But countries like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan could all be affected too because of disruption to supply chains. China sources a lot of components that go into its finished goods from these other countries. As Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out, \"any dent in China's export flows will inevitably affect\" these other countries. The case could be made for manufacturing to shift to these other countries - and for them to take advantage of selling to the US - but that shift would take time, and it's hard to see who could match China's scale. Ultimately, the US consumer will end up paying more for these products. China backlash US firms operating in China could also face a \"China backlash\". Elon Musk's electric car firm Tesla, for instance, has already highlighted just how important the Chinese market is to it. But it imports all of its products to China and so would see a 25% tariff placed on its cars sold in China - on top of the 15% tax imported vehicles already face there. This would inevitably push up prices for Tesla in China, making its vehicles less competitive than they already are, relative to others. Sino-US tensions could also end up \"delaying or preventing\" Tesla's ability to release its full potential in China, according to Silk Road Research. How bad can it get? It's the question I ask every business person I meet, and the answer is typically always the same: nobody knows. If history is any guide, then past trade wars have led to deep economic malaise. In particular the US Smoot-Hawley tariffs enacted in 1930 are thought to have inspired a trade war, and led to a massive decline in global trade. As one study points out, world trade fell by 66% from 1929 to 1934, while US exports and imports to and from Europe each also fell by about two-thirds. While no one is saying we're there yet, businesses are getting more concerned than they have been in the past, especially because of all the uncertainty. The tit-for-tat mentality between Beijing and Washington could just end up antagonising both sides to a point where they cannot climb down from their hostile positions for fear of losing face. \"You start with protectionism and isolationism,\" says Victor Mills, chief executive of Singapore's International Chamber of Commerce. \"And then you don't just beggar your neighbour, you beggar yourself.\" What many business people are hoping of course, is that this sound and fury is just the start of another series of negotiations. But the worry is that if it's not - it will escalate, and everybody will be the poorer. And that includes you and me.", "summary": "如果全球最大两个经济体发生战争，世界会变成什么样？"}

Should those risks materialise, a rate cut would be a viable option, he said. UK interest rates have been held at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years. Softening employment figures and weakening surveys on manufacturing and construction output suggested growth in the UK could slow in the second half of the year and inflation might not pick up as expected. Furthermore, problems in emerging markets could be a drag on UK growth and the headwinds from those economies were unlikely to abate any time soon, Mr Haldane added. He described recent events in Greece and China as \"the latest leg of what might be called a three-part crisis trilogy.\" \"The balance of risks to UK growth, and to UK inflation at the two-year horizon, is skewed squarely and significantly to the downside,\" Mr Haldane said. The case for raising interest rates was \"some way from being made\", he added. \"Were the downside risks I have discussed to materialise, there could be a need to loosen rather than tighten the monetary reins as a next step to support UK growth and return inflation to target,\" he said.

Large crowds of people had turned out to cheer the stars on the red carpet, which stretched along the streets around the venue in Kensington, west London. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended the screening on Tuesday night, along with stars Dame Judi Dench, Javier Bardem and the film's director Sam Mendes. James Bond received the royal seal of approval earlier this year at the Olympics opening ceremony when Daniel Craig's character appeared in a short film alongside the Queen. Craig said he was \"incredibly proud\" to be playing the hero created by Ian Fleming, who first appeared on the big screen in Dr No in 1962. \"It was the 50th year so we had try and celebrate that,\" he said. \"Sam and I are huge Bond fans and we wanted to make the best Bond movie we could, and he's done a tremendous job.\" Proceeds from the royal gala are going to charities that help members of Britain's intelligence services. Skyfall sees spy chief M (Dench) battling a crisis with roots in her past, and Bardem playing a villain bent on revenge. Bardem said: \"Sam Mendes has done something very challenging which is to mix the flavour of the classic Bond movies with something more modern.\" Mendes said: \"The weirdest thing is that about two weeks ago I was still finishing the movie with about three other people in a dark room - so the big shock is coming out and finding people about to see the movie.\" Other stars on the red carpet included Ralph Fiennes, who plays a senior government official, Bond girls Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe, and Ben Whishaw as the new Q. Whishaw said: \"I'm so thrilled to be a part of this phenomenon.\" Harris, who plays British agent Eve, said she tried to avoid watching the performances of previous Bond girls as she prepared for the role. \"I didn't want to be influenced by that. What was much more useful to me was interviewing a former MI6 agent who came along and answered all our questions about what it was like to be a real agent.\" Marlohe, who plays the mysterious Severine, said on the red carpet: \"We filmed the movie a long time ago but suddenly it brings back all the memories, and I feel very moved to be here.\" Barbara Broccoli, who co-produces the Bond films with Michael G Wilson, said Skyfall was \"classic Bond but with a contemporary feel\". She added: \"We wanted to make a film for the 50th anniversary for the fans and we wanted to make the best Bond ever - we tried real hard so I hope the audiences like at as much as we enjoyed making it.\" Skyfall has been praised by critics, with some indeed hailing it as the ultimate Bond adventure. The Independent's Geoffrey McNab said: \"If not a full-blown triumph, this is certainly one of the best Bonds in recent memory.\" The Times's Kate Muir called it \"a great British bulldog of a movie\". All eyes will be on the box office after the film opens on Friday to see if Skyfall can top Daniel Craig's other outings as the secret agent. 2008's Quantum of Solace made £367.4m ($586.1m) worldwide, while Casino Royale (2006) made £372.5m ($594.2m).", "summary": "英国影星丹尼尔·克雷格（Daniel Graig）盛赞最新007邦德系列片《天降杀机》（Skyfall）的伦敦首映式是他出演邦德片以来最好的一次。"}

The move forces Ralls Corp to divest its stake in the projects, which were located near restricted airspace used by the military base. The president's order came after an investigation into the wind farms by the US Committee on Foreign Investments (CFIUS) said there was no way to mitigate the national security risks posed by the Chinese company's plans. The White House order said: \"There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Ralls Corporation... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\" The order also targeted Sany Group, the company that makes the turbine generators.

Reports say they include nine Russians, eight Cambodians and five Chinese. The EU says such schemes may mask fraud. Cyprus offers an EU passport for an investment of at least €2m (£1.7m). Malta and Bulgaria have similar schemes, now under EU scrutiny. Mr Petrides said \"mistakes\" had been made in processing some citizenship requests. \"It was a mistake not to have criteria, for instance, for high-risk persons,\" he said. The other non-EU individuals among the 26 are reported to be from Malaysia, Kenya and Iran. In January the EU told member states to tighten checks on non-EU nationals seeking passports via investments. There is concern that the so-called \"golden passports\" may be a backdoor into the EU for criminal gangs or government officials to launder huge sums, or evade tax. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. EU citizens can move easily throughout the 28-nation bloc, as well as live and work in another member state without the bureaucratic hurdles that non-EU nationals face. Other EU states including the UK offer \"golden\" residence visas in exchange for large investments. Wealthy suspects Mr Petrides said the decision to revoke 26 individuals' Cypriot passports stemmed from the examination of nine investment cases. He told the BBC that \"we're looking at cases of naturalisation before 2018\". \"This is according to guidelines from the EU, that when the criteria change, there should be second checks.\" This year Cyprus introduced 11 categories of \"high-risk individuals excluded from applying\", Mr Petrides said. One category is \"politically exposed persons (PEPs)\" - that is, any holder of public office. PEPs are considered a corruption risk because of their prominence and influence. Cyprus also now excludes: anyone previously convicted or under investigation in their own country; anyone linked to an illegal entity; or anyone under international sanctions. The second checks involve about 2,000 Cyprus passport-holders, Mr Petrides said. The biggest groups of applicants are Russians and Chinese. The Malaysian is suspected to be businessman Jho Low, wanted in connection with a massive state investment scandal. On Tuesday, Cypriot newspaper Politis reported that he had acquired a Cypriot passport. Jho Low is a central figure in the 1MDB case - a global scandal that saw billions of dollars go missing from a Malaysian state fund. His whereabouts are not known. He has denied any wrongdoing. The Financial Times says he bought a €5m property in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa in 2015, according to an invoice seen by the FT. Last month the US Department of Justice struck a deal to recover more than $700m ($544m) in assets, including luxury US properties, allegedly acquired by Mr Low and his family. There was no admission of wrongdoing by him. Russia and Cambodia Russian government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta, meanwhile, reports that billionaire Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska has also applied for a Cypriot passport. He is among senior Russian state officials and oligarchs blacklisted in the US for \"advancing Russia's malign activities\". The US Treasury says the industrialist has been investigated for money-laundering and some other alleged crimes. A Deripaska representative quoted by Rossiiskaya Gazeta said Cypriot citizenship would help Mr Deripaska's \"broad range of business interests... which require constant travel worldwide\". Cyprus launched its \"golden passport\" scheme to help its recovery from the 2013 financial crisis, when an EU bailout was organised for troubled Cypriot banks. The scheme has resulted in nearly 4,000 non-EU nationals getting Cypriot passports - investors and family members - and about €6bn in earnings for Cyprus. An investigation by Reuters news agency last month linked Cyprus to close associates and relatives of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985.

What is GHB? Although it is sometimes referred to as a date rape drug, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) is actually used recreationally and consensually. It is fairly common for gay men to use it during chemsex - when drugs are used to enhance sex between two or more partners - but it is also used by heterosexuals as a party drug. But rapists use GHB as a weapon - one recent survey estimated more than a quarter of those polled were sexually assaulted whilst unconscious. GHB is a separate but almost identical drug to GBL (gamma-butyrolactone), a substance sold legally as an industrial solvent but which becomes GHB once it enters the body. Together the drugs are known as \"G\", and both come in the form of a clear, odourless, oily liquid that is diluted in soft drinks and swallowed. What does it do? G can give users a feeling of euphoria and can increase their sex drive. But increasing the dose by a fraction, even less than a millilitre, can be fatal. Overdosing on G - which is particularly easy when it is mixed with alcohol or other drugs, and when the strength in bottles varies - can make people incoherent, suffer convulsions, lose consciousness and stop breathing altogether. Professor Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, warns: \"It's a drug that poses huge risks when people are out there trying to use it for fun.\" \"If you take one drop extra of GHB, then 20 minutes later you're unconscious,\" he says. How many deaths have been linked to GHB? According to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, there were 120 deaths in England and Wales between 2014 and 2018 that involved GHB. But the total number could be much higher - GHB is not part of routine toxicology tests after sudden deaths. According to Professor Winstock, the drug can be difficult and expensive to detect. And sexual assaults? It is also difficult to know for sure how many sexual assaults are connected to GHB. Before Sinaga's conviction, perhaps the highest profile case was that of convicted serial killer Stephen Port, who was given a life sentence in 2016 for poisoning four young men with lethal doses of the drug. Of the 2,700 gay and bisexual men who have used G that responded to a survey conducted by BuzzFeed News and Channel 4 Dispatches last year, 28% said they had been assaulted. Patrick Strudwick, BuzzFeed News' LGBT editor and presenter of the Channel 4 documentary Sex, Drugs and Murder, calls G \"a rapist's weapon of choice in 2020\". \"Because... it can be slipped into someone's drink without them knowing and because it can very easily lead to unconsciousness, it is therefore ripe for use by predators,\" he says. An additional obstacle to knowing the scale of the problem is that victims often don't report it to the police, says Professor Winstock. People can feel uncertain about what happened, and whether a crime occurred, he says, as well as shame, guilt and fear \"of having to disclose information that they may find very embarrassing\", he says. Some also fear they could be investigated for drugs offences. Is it addictive? A dependence on G can develop quickly, and Professor Winstock warns that anyone who has taken it daily should not try to stop without medical help. \"People can become physically dependent, and withdrawal can be life-threatening,\" he says. The long term effects of taking G repeatedly are not yet known. How common is it? Like many illicit drugs, the prevalence of G is hard to track as it does not feature in national drug use surveys. But Strudwick says G is \"very easy to find and to buy if you know where to look\" because of the \"legal loophole\" that means GBL can be sold for industrial use - as a paint stripper, among other things. \"Companies are shipping it to people in Britain, advertising it online... Once sold in large quantities, it can then be distributed and supplied by dealers in smaller quantities through dating apps such as Grindr,\" he says. Where does it come from? GHB was developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic, but was discontinued because of its side effects. During the 1980s, it was used as a sleep aid and a supplement for body building. Is it illegal? GHB has been a Class C drug since 2003, when it was brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Although GBL is used legally in industry, it has also been a Class C drug since 2009, and anyone who supplies or possesses it, believing that it will be consumed, is breaking the law. Possessing either drug can warrant up to two years in prison with or without an unlimited fine, and supplying can result in up to 14 years with or without such a fine. Dr Winstock says that increasing the class would make \"absolutely no difference\" to its usage, and would discourage people from seeking help. Instead he says the government should focus on educating people so that drugs can be used more safely, and on promoting \"honest conversations\" about their use. The family of Eric Michels, who was murdered with an overdose of GHB in 2018, have been campaigning for the drug to be reclassified as Class A. His son Sam told the BBC it was \"a really, really dangerous drug\" which had killed multiple people, including his dad.

The game - sometimes translated as King of Glory - lets players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes. Critics in China accused the game of being \"addictive\". Analysis by Robin Brant, political correspondent, Shanghai Tencent now sits alongside a handful of US companies you are much more likely to have heard of: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. Its golden egg is called wei shin, known in English as WeChat. The app is almost ubiquitous in China - nearly a billion people use it every month. What started out as a messaging platform now lets you pay for shopping, order a taxi, invest, get a takeaway… the list goes on. Tencent is hoping to export this Chinese phenomenon abroad, and Malaysia is first in line for the payment system. But it is proving difficult to get people outside China to embrace WeChat. The company has long agreed to censor content in China - and abroad - in line with the demands of the Chinese government. There are also persistent concerns about security because, unlike those on some other messaging apps, communications on WeChat are not encrypted.", "summary": "中国最大的社交网络公司腾讯的市值首次超过Facebook。"}

Huawei had previously said none of its technologies was designed to identify ethnic groups. It now plans to alter the patent. Forced-labour camps The company indicated this would involve asking the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) - the country's patent authority - for permission to delete the reference to Uighurs in the Chinese-language document. Uighur people belong to a mostly Muslim ethnic group that lives mainly in Xinjiang province, in north-western China. Government authorities are accused of using high-tech surveillance against them and detaining many in forced-labour camps, where children are sometimes separated from their parents. Beijing says the camps offer voluntary education and training. \"One technical requirement of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's video-surveillance networks is the detection of ethnicity - particularly of Uighurs,\" said Maya Wang, from Human Rights Watch. \"While in the rest of the world, such targeting and persecution of a people on the basis of their ethnicity would be completely unacceptable, the persecution and severe discrimination of Uighurs in many aspects of life in China remain unchallenged because Uighurs have no power in China.\" Body movements Huawei's patent was originally filed in July 2018, in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences . It describes ways to use deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques to identify various features of pedestrians photographed or filmed in the street. It focuses on addressing the fact different body postures - for example whether someone is sitting or standing - can affect accuracy. But the document also lists attributes by which a person might be targeted, which it says can include \"race (Han [China's biggest ethnic group], Uighur)\". A spokesman said this reference should not have been included. \"Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination,\" he said. \"Identifying individuals' race was never part of the research-and-development project. \"It should never have become part of the application. \"And we are taking proactive steps to amend it. \"We are continuously working to ensure new and evolving technology is developed and applied with the utmost care and integrity.\" 'Confidential' document The patent was brought to light by the video-surveillance research group IPVM. It had previously flagged a separate \"confidential\" document on Huawei's website, referencing work on a \"Uighur alert\" system. In that case, Huawei said the page referenced a test rather than a real-world application and denied selling systems that identified people by their ethnicity. On Wednesday, Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee and leads the Conservative Party's China Research Group, told BBC News: \"Chinese tech giants supporting the brutal assault on the Uighur population show us why we as consumers and as a society must be careful with who we buy our products from or award business to. \"Developing ethnic-labelling technology for use by a repressive regime is clearly not behaviour that lives up to our standards.\" Facial-recognition software IPVM also discovered references to Uighur people in patents filed by the Chinese artificial-intelligence company Sensetime and image-recognition specialist Megvii. Sensetime's filing, from July 2019, discusses ways facial-recognition software could be used for more efficient \"security protection\", such as searching for \"a middle-aged Uighur with sunglasses and a beard\" or a Uighur person wearing a mask. A Sensetime spokeswoman said the references were \"regrettable\". \"We understand the importance of our responsibilities, which is why we began to develop our AI Code of Ethics in mid-2019,\" she said, adding the patent had predated this code. Ethnic-labelling solutions Megvii's June 2019 patent, meanwhile, described a way of relabelling pictures of faces tagged incorrectly in a database. It said the classifications could be based on ethnicity, for example, including \"Han, Uighur, non-Han, non-Uighur and unknown\". The company told BBC News it would now withdraw the patent application. \"Megvii recognises that the language used in our 2019 patent application is open to misunderstanding,\" it said. \"Megvii has not developed and will not develop or sell racial- or ethnic-labelling solutions. \"Megvii acknowledges that, in the past, we have focused on our commercial development and lacked appropriate control of our marketing, sales, and operations materials. \"We are undertaking measures to correct the situation.\" Attribute-recognition model IPVM also flagged image-recognition patents filed by two of China's biggest technology conglomerates, Alibaba and Baidu, that referenced classifying people by ethnicity but did not specifically mention the Uighur people by name. Alibaba responded: \"Racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates our policies and values. \"We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups.\" And Baidu said: \"When filing for a patent, the document notes are meant as an example of a technical explanation, in this case describing what the attribute-recognition model is rather than representing the expected implementation of the invention. \"We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to identify or target specific ethnic groups.\" But Human Rights Watch said it still had concerns. \"Any company that sells video-surveillance software and systems to the Chinese police would have to ensure that they meet the police's requirements, which includes the capacity for ethnicity detection,\" Ms Wang said. \"The right thing for these companies to do is to immediately cease their sale and maintenance of surveillance equipment, software and systems, to the Chinese police.\"", "summary": "华为的一项专利被发现，可以在行人的图像中识别出维吾尔族人。"}

Delegates argued that young children learn best through play. The Department for Education says it will be a \"proper measure of progress from when children start school\". The NUT conference in Brighton voted to \"investigate the possibility of a mass campaign of principled non-compliance with any policies that erode children's right to play in the early years\". This opposes the baseline assessment tests which the government wants to introduce as the starting point for measuring progress through primary school. Speaking ahead of the debate, Ros McNeil, the union's head of education and equalities, argued that the tests would focus on things that are easy to measure, such as the ability to count up to 10 and will force schools to push children into formal learning too early. Building blocks She said research suggested that this is \"developmentally damaging\". Most schools in England already assess reception children on entry to school, but these tests will formalise that. The tests would be carried out in the first few weeks of the autumn term and will focus on some of the key building blocks of learning, such as counting and picture and letter and number recognition. Hazel Danson, a primary teacher from Huddersfield, said ministers were displaying a \"fundamental lack of understanding\" about how very young children learn. Play activities using sand and water or allowing children to use bikes and play outside helps them develop physical skills and co-ordination which are vital when they are asked to hold a pen, Ms Danson argued. \"It looks like they are just messing about. It is not formalised in any way - but they are learning.\" She said there was frustration among teachers that the government \"will not listen to the wealth of evidence out there\". She added that this was likely to result in \"a groundswell of non-compliance\" among early years teachers. She urged the union to \"pro-actively look for ways of preventing our members being a position where they damage children\". NUT General Secretary Christine Blower said: \"We need to be inspiring young children not making them afraid or bored through a task-orientated curriculum which simply stultifies the learning process. \"Being confident, independent and curious is as important as cognitive and academic skills and must be defined in the light of children's diverse abilities.\" The government said it was working with teachers to improve standards in primary schools and introduce a proper measure of progress from when children start school to age 11. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Schools will be held to account either for ensuring all children make sufficient progress from reception to the end of primary school, or for ensuring at least 85% achieve the expected level in reading, writing and maths. \"We want to see all children leaving primary school with a good standard of reading, writing and maths so that they can thrive at secondary school.\"", "summary": "英国教育部证实，英格兰小学从2016年开始将对学前班的学生进行基础水平考试。"}

After a six-hour labour, Noel was safely delivered in a US hospital by his surrogate mother, on behalf of two hopeful parents. The parents cried together as they cut his umbilical cord, bonded as they fed Noel his first bottle of milk, and later, proudly took him home to his new life in Singapore. Noel's life since then has been as typical as that of any other boy his age in Singapore, except for the fact that under Singaporean law, he is an illegitimate child, a status that could have implications throughout his life. James and Shawn - all names have been changed to protect the child's identity - had been a couple for a decade before deciding they wanted to have a child together. They considered adoption, but were told by people with personal experience that instances of gay men being allowed to adopt were rare. While single men are allowed to adopt male children, they didn't want to apply as individuals, and didn't want to have to conceal their relationship during the adoption process. So they instead turned to the idea of surrogacy. Surrogacy is illegal within Singapore, so the couple decided to travel to the US, as many couples have before. An egg donor was picked through an agency, and the egg fertilised with James's sperm through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). They paid US$200,000 (£144,300) for the surrogacy process, and after nine months, they flew back to the US to witness the birth of their child. \"It felt surreal that we finally had our own child,\" James told the BBC. \"We were bursting with so much love and joy, and suddenly it felt like there was so much more meaning to our lives.\" He said he \"did not know of any existing laws prohibiting overseas surrogacy at the time\". 'Where would he go?' But upon their return to Singapore, reality struck. Because Noel's biological mother and father were not married, he was considered illegitimate in the eyes of the law. Additionally, as his birth mother was foreign, he was not automatically a Singaporean citizen. An application for Singaporean citizenship for Noel was turned down, meaning he was not entitled to any governmental benefits or assistance, and risked not inheriting anything from his father. James is still recognised by the law as Noel's biological father, so the now four-year-old is still allowed to live with him. Noel was instead granted a Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP), which is valid for six months and has to be renewed periodically. The LTVP can be rescinded and is not a permanent solution. \"[If it were rescinded] he would have to leave Singapore. Where would he go?\" James said. \"Singapore is the only home he's known. He has a special bond with his grandparents, aunts and cousins... it would devastate us.\" Adoption conundrum Towards the end of 2014, James decided to apply to adopt his biological son, to shake off his \"illegitimate\" status. Adoption would not automatically lead to citizenship, but according to James' lawyer, Ivan Cheong of Eversheds Harry Elias LLP, it was likely that it would help their cause. They had to wait until December last year before hearing back from the Family Courts - the bid had been rejected. When this became public, many saw it as a judgement by the state on the couple's sexuality and relationship. Sex between men is illegal in Singapore, and same-sex marriages are not recognised in law - Noel could never be considered legitimate as the child of two men. Singaporean LGBT campaign group Pink Dot said the ruling was based on \"an outdated view of what a family should constitute\". The group said it was \"a cruel thing\" to deny a child legitimacy to his own biological father, and that the law was \"falling behind society's evolving nature\". Judge Shobha Nair, in her ruling, had insisted the decision was not based on the court's view of what \"a family unit ought to be\". \"This case has very little to do with the propriety and/or effectiveness of same-gender parenting,\" she said, but was about the ethics of commercial surrogacy. That the couple paid S$200,000 for the child \"reflects the very thing the Adoption Act seeks to prevent - the use of money to encourage the movement of life from one hand to another,\" she said. Mr Cheong agreed, telling the BBC it \"was clear that the dismissal of the application was not because my client is in a same-sex relationship with his partner\". Singaporean authorities have said their role is to encourage \"parenthood within marriage\" and that \"planned and deliberate parenthood\" by singles - as James is in the eyes of the law - \"runs contrary to this\". Dr Mathew Mathews, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore, says there is still \"much support for parenthood to happen within the context of the 'traditional family' in Singapore\", but that views are starting to change. \"More Singaporeans today accept that some children will be raised in contexts which differ from their idealised conceptions of family, though they might be hesitant of this becoming the norm.\" No regrets On 4 January, the couple filed an appeal against the decision. They are still awaiting its outcome, but said they knew adoption would \"not be an easy process\". \"We had hoped that the courts would see the merits of our case, we are very sad and disappointed this wasn't [so],\" said James. Currently, James has no legal rights to the child, but still remains his de facto parent due to their biological link, and is allowed to make all decisions on behalf of Noel. When asked if they would consider migrating moving overseas should the appeal fail, James said: \"Singapore is our home. My partner and I are true-blue Singaporeans, born and bred here. We received our education here. We served in the Singapore Army. \"Our families and lives are rooted here in this country we love. We've never been made to feel different, or been discriminated against, except when dealing with the authorities. \"Having to leave...is not a decision we will make lightly.\" The couple add that they have no regrets having Noel, who is currently \"oblivious to the ordeal\", despite the challenges it has presented. \"The four years of joy my son brought to us cannot be adequately measured or put in words. He knows he has two fathers - he calls me Papa and my partner Daddy,\" James explains. \"Our neighbours, extended family - they've all embraced him and often tell him how lucky he is to have two caring fathers. We have no regrets having him.\"", "summary": "熠熠生辉的新加坡完全是一个现代化的城市，但一个父亲收养他孩子的挣扎过程表明了现代价值观与传统家庭观念之间的对抗。BBC记者陈炜斯（Yvette Tan）从新加坡报道："}

Technically yes - North Korea has conducted several tests with nuclear bombs. However, in order to launch a nuclear attack on its neighbours, it needs to be able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on to a missile. While North Korea claims it has successfully \"miniaturised\" nuclear warheads, international experts have long cast doubt on these claims. Yet according to information leaked to the Washington Post in August 2017, US intelligence officials now do believe North Korea is capable of miniaturisation. How powerful are North Korea's nuclear bombs? North Korea says it has conducted five successful nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009, 2013 and in January and September 2016. The yield of the bombs appears to have increased. September 2016's test has indicated a device with an explosive yield of between 10 and 30 kilotonnes - which, if confirmed, would make it the North's strongest nuclear test ever. The other big question is whether the devices being tested are atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs, which are more powerful. H-bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash massive amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. The 2006, 2009 and 2013 tests were all atomic bomb tests. North Korea claimed that its January 2016 test was of a hydrogen bomb. But experts cast doubt on the claim given the size of the explosion registered. Plutonium or uranium? Another question is what the starting material for the nuclear tests is. Analysts believe the first two tests used plutonium, but whether the North used plutonium or uranium as the starting material for the 2013 test is unclear. A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. Can North Korea deliver it? There is no consensus on exactly where North Korea is in terms of miniaturising a nuclear device so that it can be delivered via a missile. According to that information leaked to the Washington Post, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. While analysts doubt Pyongyang's claim, most experts agree the missile could reach Alaska or Hawaii. What else do we know about the North's nuclear programme? A site in the mountains near Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility, while the January and September 2016 tests were said to have been carried out at the Punggye-ri site. The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Both the US and South Korea have also said that they believe the North has additional sites linked to a uranium-enrichment programme. The country has plentiful reserves of uranium ore. What has the global community done about this? The US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea engaged the North in multiple rounds of negotiations known as six-party talks. There were various attempts to agree disarmament deals with North Korea, but none of this has ultimately deterred Pyongyang. In 2005, North Korea agreed to a landmark deal to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for economic aid and political concessions. In 2008, it destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon as part of the disarmament-for-aid deal. But implementing the deal proved difficult and talks stalled in 2009. The US never believed Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon, purportedly for electricity generation, to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. In 2012, North Korea suddenly announced it would suspend nuclear activities and place a moratorium on missile tests in exchange for US food aid. But this came to nothing when Pyongyang tried to launch a rocket in April that year. In March 2013, after a war of words with the US and with new UN sanctions over the North's third nuclear test, Pyongyang vowed to restart all facilities at Yongbyon. By 2015, normal operations there appeared to have resumed. The 2016 tests brought international condemnation, including from China - the North's main trading partner, and only ally. In 2017, the UN agreed a new sanctions package in response to the tests. In August, US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" should the country not abandon its threats against the US. The rhetoric from Washington failed, though, to rein in Pyongyang which in turn said it was developing a strike plan to hit the US territory of Guam, an island in the Western Pacific.", "summary": "朝鲜核计划成了国际社会一大头痛。各种努力一齐尝试，朝鲜还是搞了五次试爆。"}

Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year. The winners announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday won the award for their \"efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war\", Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. The pair both made a \"crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes\", Ms Reiss-Andersen added. How have the winners reacted? Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would \"look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity\". \"For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them,\" she added. \"Persecution of minorities must end. We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors.\" New Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award \"an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry\". Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. \"I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,\" he told Norwegian newspaper VG. He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence. \"This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,\" he told reporters gathered outside his clinic. Who is Nadia Murad? Ms Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity. After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Ms Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS. She was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg. Ms Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. Who is Denis Mukwege? He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Denis Mukwege in his own words It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: \"People came into my village and raped me, tortured me.\" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Who else won a Nobel award this year? Earlier this week the Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists - Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research.

Other Western countries have also urged China to release Mr Liu. 'Insult' Mr Liu, 54, was a key leader in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Last year he received an 11-year sentence for \"inciting subversion\" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China.

The citation described him as \"the foremost symbol of this wide-ranging struggle for human rights in China\". Beijing quickly condemned the award, saying it could damage China-Norway relations. Foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said: \"Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who violated Chinese law.

In New York, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the award to Mr Liu was \"a recognition of the growing international consensus for improving human rights practices and culture around the world\". German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said China should free him so he could attend the ceremony. France's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner also welcomed the award and also called on China to release Mr Liu. UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay said the prize recognised a \"very prominent human rights defender\". Mr Liu's wife, Liu Xia, said she was \"so excited\" by the award. She told AFP news agency: \"I want to thank everyone for supporting Liu Xiaobo.

The Commission says that this gas can lead to major respiratory illnesses and premature deaths. Britain was supposed to meet EU limits by 2010, but the government admits that London won't achieve this standard until 2025. The UK's problem with dirty air stems from the EU's air pollution directive, which came into force in 2008. It set limits on the the levels of air-borne contaminants, including particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, gases that are produced from the burning of fossil fuels. They are an important element of ground-level ozone, which can damage human health as well as plants and animals. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which in the main is produced by diesel cars and trucks, can inflame the lining of the lungs and lead to respiratory disease. It is of particular concern to people living near roadways in big cities and those suffering with asthma. Excess gas Controlling the amount of this gas in air has proved particularly difficult for the UK. For the purposes of air pollution, the UK is divided into 43 zones. In 2010, when the EU restrictions were meant to come into effect, the levels of nitrogen dioxide were exceeding the limits in 40 of these 43 areas. Member states were able get an extra five years' grace if they put in place plans to cut levels of NO2. The UK admitted that the limits relating to 16 zones, including London, could not be met by the revised deadline of 2015. For many of these areas, including Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, Merseyside and Glasgow, the government believes the levels can be reached by 2020. In London though, they admit it is likely to be 2025. For the EU, this is far too long. They've decided to launch the first case against a member state for breaching the limits on NO2. Several other EU members, including France, Sweden, Denmark and Greece have also exceeded the levels, but the EU denied that the UK was being picked on. \"Our priority is to protect public health and the environment,\" said European Commission spokesman Joe Hennon. \"We think that's what the people of the UK would want as well.\" What might have tipped the EU's hand was a ruling by the UK Supreme Court last year. In a case brought by environmental campaigners ClientEarth, the judges agreed that the government was in breach of an obligation to reduce air pollution. In the judgement, Justice Lord Carnworth wrote that \"the way is now open to immediate enforcement at national or European level.\" The campaign group believes that, in addition to the Supreme Court verdict, the scale and the duration of the UK's breaches made the EU action inevitable. \"The UK has some of the worst NO2 levels in Europe, they're a national disgrace,\" said Alan Andrews, a lawyer with ClientEarth. \"London has a particular problem, in some streets it is three or four times above the legal limits.\" The legal process could ultimately end in the European Court of Justice where the UK would face huge fines if found in breach of the directive. If the government is to cut levels it will need to take drastic actions, say campaigners. Around half of new car sales are diesel powered, they say. There will need to be strict low emissions zones in cities. \"Germany implemented low emissions zones very early,\" said Alan Andrews. \"They have 60, we just have the one in London and ours doesn't include cars - it's a low standard.\" Another option is cutting speed limits. \"The evidence from Germany suggests they can reduce NO2 by 10-15% on heavily polluted roads, but the scale here in the UK is so big they need to be looking at everything possible to tackle the problem,\" said Mr Andrews. The UK has two months to respond to the European Commission. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said that Britain wasn't alone in breaching the NO2 limits, pointing out that in 2012, 21 member states reported their emissions did not comply with the annual mean target. \"Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades. Just like for other member states, meeting the NO2 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge,\" said a spokesman. \"That is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the commission to ensure this happens as soon as possible.\" A spokeswoman for London Mayor Boris Johnson said: \"Since the mayor was elected, the number of people living in areas exceeding nitrogen dioxide limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action. \"This includes the introduction of the world's first ultra-low emission zone in central London from 2020, tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £20m fund to tackle local problem areas.\" Follow Matt on Twitter.", "summary": "欧盟委员会对英国治理空气污染不力采取法律行动。"}

He was suffering from a fever, a dry cough, and flu-like symptoms. When he became ill he thought of his time as a child in Cameroon when he contracted malaria. He feared the worse. \"When I was going to the hospital for the first time I was thinking about my death and how I thought it was going to happen,\" he said. For 13 days he remained in isolation in a local Chinese hospital. He was treated with antibiotics and drugs typically used to treat HIV patients. After two weeks of care he began to show signs of recovery. The CT scan showed no trace of the illness. He became the first African person known to be infected with the deadly coronavirus and the first to recover. His medical care was covered by the Chinese state. Egypt has become the first country in Africa to confirm a case of the coronavirus. Health professionals warn that countries with weaker health systems may struggle to cope with a potential outbreak of the illness, which has led to more than 1,770 deaths and infected more than 72,000 people, mostly in China. \"I don't want to go home before finishing studying. I think there is no need to return home because all hospital fees were taken care of by the Chinese government,\" says Mr Senou. To evacuate or not? Since late January governments around the world, led by the US, began evacuating their citizens out of Wuhan and neighbouring cities. But thousands of African students, workers and families, remain in lockdown across the central Hubei province - the outbreak began in the provincial capital Wuhan - and some think their governments should do more to help them. \"We are sons and daughters of Africa but Africa is not willing to come to our rescue when we need it the most,\" says Tisiliyani Salima, a medical student at Tongji Medical University and president of the Zambian Wuhan student association. Learn more about the new virus For close to a month Ms Salima has been living in self-quarantine. Time has begun to lose meaning for the 24-year old student. She spends her days sleeping and checking updates on Chinese social media apps. She acts as the liaison between her embassy and the 186 Zambian students living under quarantine in Wuhan. Many worry about food safety, supplies, and lack information in a city that this week has seen an average of 100 deaths a day. She watched other international classmates evacuated from the city while her countrymen and women were left behind. \"South of the Sahara most African countries have had a similar response,\" says one student who agreed to talk under the condition of anonymity. \"Publicly or privately African countries say that China can handle the situation. But the situation is not under control. When you listen to the official response it tells you that the African countries do not want to offend China. We don't have the bargaining power,\" the student says. China is currently Africa's largest trading partner and the ties between the two have blossomed in recent years. In the process China has become home to 80,000 African students, many attracted to the middle kingdom by scholarship programmes. But community leaders say families, young and old are stranded in Hubei province with little aid or assistance from their governments. \"People are saying: 'Don't bring us back because Nigeria can't handle us.' I feel conflicted but at the end of the day I am also human,\" says Angela, a recent graduate from Nigeria, who only gave her first name. \"I would appreciate if they would recognise that there are Nigerians here but we don't seem to be a priority. We didn't get any response from our government,\" she says. Last week, for the first time in 22 days in lockdown, dwindling supplies forced Angela to venture out of her apartment to buy some essentials. \"The city is like a ghost town. When I left my complex I didn't know if I would even be allowed back in. People are checking temperatures outside the gate,\" she says in a phone interview from her apartment. On 30 January the Cameroonian community penned an open letter to the president urging their government to evacuate citizens stuck in the epicentre of the outbreak. Weeks on Dr Pisso Scott Nseke, a community leader in Wuhan, says Cameroonians are still waiting for a response. He accepts that the community is not united in the desire to be evacuated but says they are disappointed by the lack of assistance from the government. As of mid-February, Egypt, Algeria, Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles had moved their citizens out of Hubei province. Other nations such as Ghana and Kenya are reportedly considering evacuating. 'We feel abandoned' Some nations have sent financial support to their citizens. According to the head of the Ivory Coast student association in Wuhan $490 ($380) was given to the 77 Ivoirians in the city following weeks of discussions with their government. But many are growing increasingly frustrated by their government's stance. Ghana has reportedly sent financial assistance to its nationals as well. \"Staying here doesn't guarantee our safety. We are just in a country that has better medical facilities,\" says Ms Salima. \"We feel abandoned. The Chinese clearly were angered by the Americans pulling their people out as they felt it caused panic,\" said one student who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity. \"There is a lot of distrust here of the authorities,\" he added. Some are calling for a continent-wide strategy to help African nationals in China. \"The decision to evacuate is not a question of 'solidarity' with China or the lack of it. It is the responsibility of every country to ultimately look after the health of their citizens wherever they are, including in China,\" says Hannah Ryder from Development Reimagined, a Beijing-based international development consultancy. As for Mr Senou, he says has no plans to return to Cameroon. \"It would be a bad and dangerous idea. The biggest fear I had from the virus was psychological and emotional. Going back home is not an option now.\"", "summary": "21岁的凯姆·塞努·帕维尔·达雷尔（Kem Senou Pavel Daryl）是居住在中国荆州的一名喀麦隆留学生。当他感染新型冠状病毒之后，他没有试图离开中国。"}

It comes as Russia cements its control of Ukraine's Crimea ahead of Sunday's referendum to join Russia. Ukraine and the West say this is illegal. In the latest move on Monday, armed men - said to be Russian troops and local militias - seized a military hospital in Crimea. The attackers marched into the hospital in the regional capital Simferopol, threatening staff and some 30 patients. Pro-Russian troops are also blockading Ukrainian troops across Crimea, which is an autonomous region. Moscow has officially denied that its troops are taking part in the blockades, describing the armed men with no insignia as Crimea's \"self-defence\" forces. The government in Kiev - as well as the US and EU - accuse Russia of invading Ukraine, in violation of international law. 'Enhance awareness' Nato said the surveillance flights would \"enhance the alliance's situational awareness\". Last week, the organisation said it was reviewing all co-operation with Russia and stepping up its engagement with the government in Kiev. Nato's announcement on Monday came hours after men in military uniforms broke into the Simferopol hospital, where Ukrainian soldiers and veterans were being treated. Some of the patients were reported to be seriously ill. The hospital director said he was forced onto a bus and kept there for half-an-hour. The attackers also herded staff into a reception to apparently meet \"the new directors\", Ukraine's Interfax-Ukraina news agency reports. Separately, pro-Russian troops tried to capture a military transport base in Bahkchysarai, a town between Simferopol and the city of Sevastopol. The gunmen fired warning shots into the air, but Ukrainian soldiers repelled the attack. Step-by-step, and meeting very little resistance, the pro-Russian troops are dismantling Ukraine's ability to resist in Crimea, says the BBC's Christian Fraser, who is in the region. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people in Ukraine held rival pro-unity and pro-Russian rallies. Moscow supporters beat up their opponents in Sevastopol. Some of the attackers were Russian Cossacks with whips. Pro-Russian activists also seized regional offices in the eastern city of Luhansk, forcing the governor to resign. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier defended Crimea's decision to stage a referendum on 16 March. Mr Putin said \"the steps taken by Crimea's legitimate authorities are based on international law\". However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told him in a phone call that she considered the vote illegal. Both EU leaders and the US have warned Moscow they would slap even tougher sanctions if Russian troops remained in Crimea. Unrest in Ukraine erupted in November after former President Viktor Yanukovych's last-minute rejection of a landmark EU deal in favour of a bailout from Russia. Mr Yanukovych was ousted last month, and a new government has been voted in by the Ukrainian parliament which Russia says was a \"coup\".", "summary": "北约将在波兰和罗马尼亚部署侦察机，用以监视乌克兰危机的进展。"}

The loss is further evidence say scientists of the rapid climate changes taking place in Greenland. \"The atmosphere in this region has warmed by about 3C since 1980,\" said Dr Jenny Turton. \"And in 2019 and 2020, it saw record summer temperatures,\" the polar researcher at Friedrich-Alexander University in Germany told BBC News. Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden is roughly 80km long by 20km wide and is the floating front end of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream - where it flows off the land into the ocean to become buoyant. At its leading edge, the 79N glacier splits in two, with a minor offshoot turning directly north. It's this offshoot, or tributary, called Spalte Glacier, that has now disintegrated. The ice feature was already heavily fractured in 2019; this summer's warmth has been its final undoing. Spalte Glacier has become a flotilla of icebergs. Look closely at the satellite pictures and the higher air temperatures recorded in the region are obvious from the large number of melt ponds that sit on top of the shelf ice. The presence of such liquid water is often problematic for ice platforms. If it fills crevasses, it can help to open them up. The water will push down on the fissures, driving them through to the base of the shelf in a process known as hydrofracturing. This will weaken an ice shelf. Oceanographers have also documented warmer sea temperatures which mean the shelf ice is almost certainly being melted from beneath as well. \"79N became 'the largest remaining Arctic ice shelf' only fairly recently, after the Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland lost a lot of area in 2010 and 2012,\" explained Prof Jason Box from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). \"What makes 79N so important is the way it's attached to the interior ice sheet, and that means that one day - if the climate warms as we expect - this region will probably become one of the major centres of action for the deglaciation of Greenland.\" The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream drains about 15% of the interior ice sheet. The stream funnels its ice either down N79 or the glacial member just to the south, Zachariae Isstrom. Zachariae has already lost most of its floating ice shelf area. Prof Box said N79 could resist longer because it was penned in right at its forward end by some islands. This lends a degree of stability. But, he added, the shelf continues to thin, albeit mostly further back along the trunk. \"This will likely lead to N79 disintegrating from the middle, which is kind of unique. I guess, though, that won't happen for another 10 or 20 years. Who knows?\" he told BBC News. July witnessed another large ice shelf structure in the Arctic lose significant area. This was Milne Ice Shelf on the northern margin of Canada's Ellesmere Island. Eighty sq km broke free from Milne, leaving a still secure segment just 106 sq km in size. Milne was the largest intact remnant from a wider shelf feature that covered 8,600 sq km at the start of the 20th Century. The fast pace of melting in Greenland was underlined in a study last month that analysed data from the US-German Grace-FO satellites. These spacecraft are able to track changes in ice mass by sensing shifts in the pull of local gravity. They essentially weigh the ice sheet. The Grace mission found 2019 to have been a record-breaking year, with the ice sheet shedding some 530 billion tonnes. That's enough meltwater running off the land into the ocean to raise global sea-levels by 1.5mm.", "summary": "卫星图片显示，北极目前的最大冰架、位于格陵兰岛东北部的79N冰川断裂，约110平方公里的冰舌脱离，碎成许多冰山在水面漂浮。"}

It was an instant hit. Mr Tang was flooded with so many friend requests that he had to ask WeChat to boost the friend limit from 5,000 to 10,000. So why did it strike such a chord? The answer goes way beyond legal difficulties and into the complex world of sign language in China. Language barriers There are two types of sign language in the country. Chinese Sign Language (CSL) is taught in schools and used by most interpreters and instructors. It is the standardised version of the language, tied closely to the written language. But day-to-day, many deaf people also use natural sign language. The language has grown and evolved over time, and changes from region to region. This has led to misunderstandings in courtrooms - and some dire consequences for deaf people - which Mr Tang is well placed to understand. He was born to deaf parents in Chongqing in south-west China, and can understand both forms of sign language. But he tells the BBC that his parents were initially hesitant about him learning. \"My parents didn't like me studying sign language at first,\" Mr Tang says. \"I had no choice but to quietly sneak into my parents' factory, to learn with the deaf ladies and gentlemen there,\" explaining that many of the workers were deaf themselves. He picked up more skills by visiting the popular Chaotianmen tourist area. \"Many deaf people from outside of the city come there. It was possible for me to learn many different versions of sign language,\" he says. Lost in translation Before becoming a lawyer, Mr Tang worked for six years as a sign language interpreter in Chinese courts. He studied law after realising many deaf people knew little about their legal rights. He tells of one notable case, where he defended a man suspected of theft. \"When I went to the city detention centre to meet [my client] I used natural sign language. He was surprised to see that I could communicate with him...then he told me, 'I can't understand much of the sign language used by the [police] interpreters'.\" Mr Tang said additional sign language lawyers were brought in to assess mistakes in the translation of evidence given earlier in the case, and the court ruled his client was innocent of one of the original charges. After the case, the judge told Mr Tang the case highlighted the \"many problems, where deaf people are involved, in the translation of sign language.\" You might also like: Defending the voiceless Mr Tang wanted to do more to help the deaf community. Despite a significant expansion in access to education, some deaf Chinese are still targeted by financial scam organisers. Stories of deaf people who lost fortunes in scams prompted Mr Tang to launch the video series that shot him to social media fame. Financial scams are thriving in many parts of China as organisers target vulnerable communities with the promise of employment or lucrative returns for direct sales. Victims are promised rewards if they recruit more investors into the operation. The schemes operate by attracting new investors, with some of the funds paid back to early joiners. Experts say the Chinese schemes are different to Western versions due to the lack of sophistication of the investors involved. Mr Tang outlined the pitfalls of Ponzi schemes by telling the story of a wolf that cheats rabbits by promising to give them high returns on their investments - for every 10 carrots they invested each month, he would give them four carrots as profit. When word got out, more rabbits would give their carrots to the wolf but in the end, the wolf conned them all by running away with their carrots. Mr Tang's video was praised not only by deaf people in China, but netizens and even the national media. He became an online celebrity almost overnight, with many outlets dubbing him the spokesperson for \"those in the world that are voiceless\". Now he uses his expertise to promote legal awareness among the deaf community, alongside his full-time job as a lawyer. He set up a public WeChat account for his video series to provide education on key legal issues. He also set up a legal welfare service to give face-to-face consultations using video calls. After being inundated with requests for legal assistance - and because of the lack of signing lawyers in China - he started training sessions for deaf people who want to forge a career in law. According to media reports, Mr Tang has hired five deaf graduates from a local university and is training them to provide legal guidance to deaf people. Deaf people aren't the only ones empowered by his videos. Mr Tang has inspired thousands of hearing people, with many saying they now want to learn sign language. \"I hope that sign language can be as important as a foreign language in our national education system,\" one Weibo user says.", "summary": "重庆一名律师用手语发布警告庞氏骗局风险的视频，这段视频走红中国社交网络。数百名聋哑人士前来向他咨询法律问题，从欺诈到家庭暴力，他唤起了人们对于庞大失聪群体的关注。"}

The Court of Appeal said she had been denied a fair hearing because she could not make her case from the Syrian camp. The Home Office said the decision was \"very disappointing\" and it would \"apply for permission to appeal\". The ruling means the government must now find a way to allow the 20-year-old, who is currently in Camp Roj in northern Syria, to appear in court in London despite repeatedly saying it would not assist removing her from Syria. Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: \"Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed.\" The judge also said that the national security concerns about her \"could be addressed and managed if she returns to the United Kingdom\". Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who made the decision to strip Ms Begum of her citizenship in February 2019, tweeted a statement saying he was \"deeply concerned about the judgement\".

If it stands, it could have major implications for the UK's policy of excluding some British-born IS supporters by depriving them of nationality once they're out of the UK. Scores of these people - all deemed a threat to national security - could seek to return to the UK as they fight their case to get back their British citizenship. Other governments have voluntarily repatriated these fighters and sought to contain their threat through prosecutions, monitoring and intensive deradicalisation. The UK has so far refused to do the same. Ms Begum's legal team challenged the move on three grounds - that it was unlawful because it left her stateless; it exposed her to a real risk of death or inhuman and degrading treatment; and she could not effectively challenge the decision while she was barred from returning to the UK. Under international law, it is only legal to revoke someone's citizenship if an individual is entitled to citizenship of another country. In February, a specialist tribunal - the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - ruled that the decision to remove Ms Begum's citizenship was lawful because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\". She is understood to have a claim to Bangladeshi nationality through her mother. SIAC, a semi-secret court which hears national security cases, also said that although there were concerns about how Ms Begum could take part in the proceedings in London, those difficulties did not mean the home secretary's decision should be overturned. In his ruling on Thursday, Lord Justice Flaux said: \"It is difficult to conceive of any case where a court or tribunal has said we cannot hold a fair trial, but we are going to go on anyway.\" Government 'shirked' responsibilities Human rights organisation Liberty, which intervened in Ms Begum's appeal, welcomed the ruling, saying the right to a fair trial was \"a fundamental part of our justice system and equal access to justice must apply to everyone\". Liberty lawyer Katie Lines added: \"Banishing someone is the act of a government shirking its responsibilities and it is critical that cruel and irresponsible government decisions can be properly challenged and overturned.\" Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, in east London, aged 15 for Syria in February 2015, with two school friends. Within days she had crossed the Turkish border and eventually reached the IS headquarters at Raqqa, where she married a Dutch convert recruit. They had three children - all of whom have since died.", "summary": "英国上诉法庭7月16日判决，沙米玛·贝古姆应获准重返英国，挑战政府撤销她英国国籍的决定。"}

Republican members of the Judiciary Committee asked whether the tech firms should be taking such action at all. This was the second time the CEOs had been cross-examined in three weeks. They were previously questioned by the Senate Commerce Committee last month in what was a more rowdy event. Once again, the issue of a law known as Section 230 loomed large. It says the platforms are generally not responsible for illegal or offensive things users post on them. President-elect Biden has suggested the regulation should be \"revoked\" since it encourages the spread of falsehoods, and several of the Democratic senators at the latest hearing followed his lead. Republicans also voiced concern of their own. They said the social media companies were taking editorial decisions about what to take down, label or leave unaltered. This, they said, made them publishers rather than just distributors of information, and as a consequence they should not be covered by Section 230 in its current form. \"Federal law gave you the ability to stand up and grow without being hit by lawsuits,\" said Republican Senator Blackburn. \"You have used this power to run amok.\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added: \"When you have companies that have the power of governments, have more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give.\" 'Frivolous lawsuits' The two tech CEOs began by defending their record over the recent US election. But Mr Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter's decision to block links to a controversial New York Post investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter had been \"wrong\", and that its failure to subsequently restore the newspaper's own tweets about the article had required a further policy change. \"I hope this... demonstrates our ability to take feedback, admit mistakes and make all changes transparently to the public,\" he said Mr Zuckerberg avoided direct reference to the matter in his opening remarks. However, he used the opportunity to challenge recent claims by Democrats that Facebook had been slow in removing posts that promoted insurrection and violence. \"We strengthened our enforcement against militias and conspiracy networks like QAnon to prevent them from using our network to organise violence or civil unrest,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. Bannon ban The two tech leaders were then both challenged over some of their recent decisions. The Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal wanted to know why Facebook had not banned Steve Bannon. President Trump's former top advisor recently called for the beheadings of disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci and the FBI director Christopher Wray in a video he posted to both Twitter and Facebook. Twitter threw him off its service, but Facebook only froze Mr Bannon's page. Mr Zuckerberg said Mr Bannon \"did violate our policies\" but had not clocked up enough strikes to permanently lose access. And when the senator called for a rethink, Mr Zuckerberg responded: \"That's not what our policies would suggest we should do.\" Mr Zuckerberg went on to dispute reports that Facebook had forgiven infractions by both of Donald Trump's sons and the news site Breitbart, among others, in order to avoid accusations of bias from conservatives. \"Those reports mischaracterise the actions that we've taken,\" he said. The Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein followed up with questions to both executives over their responses to President Trump's posts about election fraud, which lacked factual basis. She asked Twitter's chief whether he thought adding labels but allowing the tweets to remain visible went far enough. Mr Dorsey responded that he believed providing \"context\" and \"connecting people to the larger conversation\" was the right path to follow. Senator Feinstein went on to ask Mr Zuckerberg if he felt enough had been done to prevent people delegitimising the election's result. She noted that hashtags for Steal The Vote and Voter Fraud had garnered more than 300,000 interactions on Facebook's platforms in the hours after Mr Trump falsely declared victory. \"I believe we have taken some very significant steps in this area,\" Mr Zuckerberg responded, pointing to information it had placed at the top of the screens of US-based Facebook and Instagram users. \"I think that we really went quite far in terms of helping to distribute reliable and accurate information about the results.\" Voter fraud warnings The Republican Senator Ted Cruz took a different tack, asking why Twitter was \"putting purported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud\". When Mr Dorsey repeated his earlier point about linking people to conversations, Mr Cruz pushed back. \"No you're not. You're putting up a page that says 'voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States'. That's not linking to a broader conversation. That's taking a disputed policy position.\" Mr Cruz added that Twitter had the right to take such a position, but only if it accepted it was a publisher and gave up Section 230's protections. And he challenged both firms to disclose how many times they had blocked Republican and Democratic candidates for office in the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections to reveal any discrepancy. Neither tech chief would give a firm commitment to do so. Republican Senator Joni Ernst later asked what the two tech leaders were doing to monitor the political views of their staff. Both of the chief executives said this would be hard to do, but they suggested one consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic was they would have more people working from home in the long-term, which in turn should entail greater diversity among their workforce. This was a far more considered hearing. When senators last grilled Dorsey and Zuckerberg, the politicians were in full campaigning mode and it was a bit of a mess. The tone today was far more relaxed, and we've learnt more because of that. Dorsey talked of the \"impossible\" situation Twitter was in - being accused of overly-censoring by Republicans and not doing enough by Democrats. Both companies said they wanted there to be more transparency, particularly around the way they moderate their platforms. Twitter was in particular in the crosshairs of Republicans, especially around its policy of adding flags to President Trump's tweets. Facebook was more a target of Democrats, who wanted to know why, for example, it had not permanently suspended Steve Bannon. Both tech leaders accepted that Section 230 needs to be revisited. And it seems inevitable this law will be reformed. So the debate will now turn to what replaces it. Leaked screenshot Republican Senator Joshua Hawley said his office had been contacted by a Facebook whistle-blower and told of an internal tool called Centra. This, the politician claimed, was used to track people's use of the wider internet as well as to monitor them logging into different Facebook accounts even if registered with different names. \"I'm not familiar with it,\" said Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Hawley expressed his frustration with this response, saying: \"It's always amazing to me... how many people before this committee suddenly develop amnesia.\" Meanwhile, the Republican Senator Michael Lee brought up Twitter's suspension of an account belonging to Mark Morgan, the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. The action was taken after Mr Morgan tweeted that the wall on the border with Mexico had helped stop \"gang members, murderers, sexual predators and drugs from entering our country\". \"What exactly is hateful about [that]?\" asked Senator Lee. Mr Dorsey acknowledged that the action had been taken in error. \"There was a mistake and it was due to the fact that we had heightened awareness around government accounts,\" he explained. The Senator responded: \"I understand that mistakes happen, but what we're going to see today is that mistakes happen... almost entirely on one side of the political aisle rather than the other.\" Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, however, said that independent research suggested such allegations of bias were \"completely baseless\". Senator Lindsey Graham also questioned both men about whether their organisations had any evidence of their platforms being addictive. \"From what I've seen so far, it's inconclusive, and most of the research suggests that the vast majority of people do not perceive or experience these services as addictive [but] there should be controls given to people to help them manage their experience better,\" said Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Dorsey said: \"Like anything else, these tools can be addictive and we should be aware of that, acknowledge it and make sure that we are making our customers aware of better patterns of usage.\" Vice-President elect Kamala Harris is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not take part in the hearing.", "summary": "脸书和推特的行政总裁在星期二再次在美国参议院的听证会上接受议员质询，就他们处理美国大选的方式解画。"}

The press secretary refused to accept the Senate Intelligence Committee report, saying \"they're not findings\".

Earlier on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan also said \"no such wiretap existed\". Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee Devin Nunes said on Wednesday he doesn't believe \"there was an actual tap of Trump Tower\".

The soldier was disoriented and was provided medical assistance and oxygen, the army said in a statement. Tensions have been high between the two countries since a deadly clash in a disputed area in June. The latest incident comes after multiple rounds of military-level talks between the two sides to defuse the situation. The Indian Army said the soldier was handed back according to \"established protocols\". Soldiers from both countries have periodically skirmished along the poorly demarcated border, called the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Both sides have accused each other of straying into their territory, which have sometimes resulted in clashes. This is not the first time the two sides have handed over citizens who strayed over the border. In September, China freed five Indian nationals after they wandered across the border. India said the youths, from a state bordering China, were hunters who had accidentally strayed into Chinese territory. What's the background? Relations between the two countries had been deteriorating since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a skirmish in the disputed Ladakh border area. China did not comment on reports that it had also suffered casualties. Then, in August, India accused China of provoking military tensions at the border twice within a week. Both charges were denied by China, which said the stand-off was \"entirely\" India's fault. And in early September, China accused India of firing \"provocative\" warning shots at its troops. India in turn, accused China of firing into the air. The allegations, if true, would have been the first time in 45 years that shots were fired at the border. A 1996 agreement prohibits the use of guns and explosives near the border. A few days later, India's foreign minister and his Chinese counterpart met in Russia, where they reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions from their shared border. Since then, several rounds of military-level talks have been conducted. But despite several rounds of talks, the nuclear-armed neighbours have failed to de-escalate tensions. There are several reasons why tensions have risen recently - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat.", "summary": "一名中国士兵被指迷路而越过喜马拉雅山区存在争议的中印边境，印度军方官员表示，印方当局已经将涉事的士兵交还中方。"}

Up to three drones were seen near the Invalides military museum, Place de la Concorde and two of the old city gates. Flying drones over Paris at night is illegal and daytime flights require authorisation from the city. Five drones were seen the previous night in similar areas, including the Eiffel Tower and above the US embassy, close to Place de la Concorde. However, some of the latest drone flights have been captured on film and will be analysed by a 10-strong team of investigators set up after the first incidents. The new sightings were also on the fringes of central Paris, at the key transport gates of Porte de Clignancourt in the north and Porte de Saint-Cloud in the south-west. \"There's no need to worry, but we should be vigilant. It's a subject being taken very seriously,\" said government spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Part of the problem was that they were so easy to operate, he said, but everything was being done to catch those involved. Small drones are inexpensive but their appearance in recent months over sensitive locations has worried French authorities. It is against the law for any aircraft to fly lower than 6,000m (19,700ft) over central Paris. Flying any aircraft under that ceiling - including drones, police helicopters and air ambulances - requires permission from city authorities. Flying a drone at night is banned completely. Analysis: Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent The security threat from these drones is minimal. Bird's-eye images of Paris landmarks are available online in far higher quality than anything these devices could produce. And small, shop-bought drones are not strong enough to deliver a significant payload of explosives. The more likely risk from these drones is that one might get out of control and crash on to a street, injuring a pedestrian or causing a car accident. That is the main reason why flying drones is banned over populated areas of France. The police cannot afford to ignore these overflights however. They are probably the work of drone enthusiasts giving the authorities the run-around, but not certainly. It could also be an organised group - eco-warriors or jihadists, for example - testing out how the security forces respond to drones. Security at key sites in Paris was tightened last month after the murders of 17 people by Islamist gunmen and French officials say that was the main reason the drones were spotted. Last month a drone was seen over the Elysee Palace, home of President Francois Hollande. In October, a 24-year-old Israeli tourist was fined €400 (£293; $453) and spent a night in jail after flying a drone over the city's historic Hotel Dieu hospital and a police station. Drones were also spotted flying over at least 13 nuclear power plants in France between October 2014 and January 2015. Those flights were thought to be the work of environmental activists but no group claimed responsibility. The latest incidents involve a group that is not lacking in money, according to aviation security specialist Christophe Naudin. Those behind them were seeking to \"defy the power of the state\", he told RTL radio, and trying to damage the French sense of security. Drones present a problem for authorities in built-up areas, in that shooting them down could endanger the public. It is possible to jam GPS or radio signals guiding them.", "summary": "巴黎市中心的地标建筑连续两个晚上出现无人机盘旋，警方对谁控制这些无人机还茫无头绪。"}

Three other men given life sentences over the killing have been acquitted by the Sindh High Court and released. The Sindh chief prosecutor says he will lodge an appeal in the Sheikh case. The province's prosecutor general Fiaz Shah told the BBC he expected Sheikh to remain in jail pending the appeal, which would be heard by the Supreme Court. A group of US journalists, including former colleagues of Pearl, said in 2011 that they believed Sheikh had not carried out the beheading. The Pearl Project alleged the killer was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is being held in Guantanamo Bay, accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks. Mr Naveed said he expected his client to be released \"in a few days\". What happened to Daniel Pearl? Pearl, who worked for the Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. According to prosecutors, Omar Saeed Sheikh lured him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. The two had built a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Pearl's son, Adam, was born in May 2002. Sheikh was convicted of Pearl's murder in July 2002 by an anti-terrorism court, and has been on death row since. Who is Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh? Sheikh was born in London in 1973, where he attended public school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested for being involved in the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American - in Delhi in 1994. He was released from prison as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. According to news agency Reuters, police in India later accused him of transferring money to one of the militants who flew a plane into the World Trade Center on 9/11. Longstanding questions over Sheikh's conviction By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The main argument of the defence lawyers was that the prosecution had failed to prove their case beyond doubt. They may have a point. There have been questions over whether the four had any direct role in Daniel Pearl's murder, though there was some evidence to show Sheikh's involvement in his kidnapping. Sheikh was widely seen as having links to Pakistan's top intelligence service, the ISI, as well as al-Qaeda, and had a role in forming the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group that carried out attacks in Indian Kashmir during the 1990s. His arrest and conviction in 2002 came in quick succession, at a time when Pakistan was under severe pressure from the United States to eliminate terror networks operating on its soil. But the Pakistani judiciary has sat on his appeal for nearly two decades, and some observers believe the present ruling has come at a time when the mood in the US and the rest of the world has changed and nobody seems to be worried about the terrorists of the past.", "summary": "巴基斯坦法庭下令，当局必须释放一名被指在巴基斯坦杀害美国记者珀尔（Daniel Pearl ）的武装份子，因为他早前已经获判没有杀害这名记者。"}

Demonstrators from the favela set barricades of tyres alight, leading to the closure of streets in the nearby tourist area of Copacabana. The violence comes weeks before Brazil hosts the football World Cup. 'Smoke everywhere' The unrest started after the discovery in Pavao-Pavaozinho of the body of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira, a 26-year-old professional dancer. Angry residents marched to a local police station accusing the officers of beating Mr Pereira to death. Witnesses said cars were set ablaze, the local police station was attacked and gunfire could be heard from the favela. \"There was smoke everywhere, shots in the street and people racing for their homes,\" one resident living nearby told AFP news agency. Pavao-Pavaozinho is one of the poor neighbourhoods of Rio that has been part of the recent \"pacification\" programme, in which police move into an area in an effort to wrest control from the drug traffickers who run it. It is an attempt by the city authorities to drive the heavily armed gangs away from the communities and restore police authority ahead of the football World Cup in June and July. But the programme is controversial as Brazilian police have been accused of using excessive force, at times killing residents not connected to any gangs. Amnesty International says some 2,000 people die every year in Brazil as a result of police violence. \"This effort to pacify the favelas is a failure; the police violence is only replacing what the drug gangs carried out before,\" resident Johanas Mesquita told the Associated Press news agency. Dancer's death Mr Pereira's body was discovered in a local day-care centre covered in wounds. According to some residents, he had been trying to flee from a shoot-out between police and drug dealers and had climbed over a wall to hide in the day-care centre. They said he had then been discovered by the officers, who, believing he was a drug dealer, had beaten him to death. The circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation, AFP news agency quoted police as saying. \"An on-site report indicates Douglas's injuries are compatible with a death caused by a fall,\" the police statement said. But his mother said he was covered in boot marks, suggesting he had been kicked to death. Firefight Large crowds, demanding an explanation for the death, gathered near the entrance to the favela, which is just a few streets away from the city's famous beaches and tourist hot-spots, reports the BBC's Wyre Davies from Rio. The clashes began at 17:30 local time (20:30 GMT) causing panic among residents returning from work. Hundreds had to mill around in nearby streets waiting for the violence to stop to return to their homes. Riot police and firefighters were sent to the area and an hour later witnesses reported hearing \"an intense firefight\". Officials said a 27-year-old man was killed by a bullet to the head. It is not yet clear who fired the shot. Riot police said they had \"rescued\" a group of 10 officers who had been surrounded by protesters inside the favela. Police said the violence had been orchestrated by a powerful criminal gang. Tony Teizeira of the Copacabana Residents' Association said the clashes came at a time when many tourists were in the area on Easter holidays. \"Unfortunately, innocent people are having to pay for this war between the police and drug traffickers,\" he said. Thousands of visitors are expected to visit Rio for the World Cup which starts in Sao Paulo on 12 June and will end with the final in Rio's famous Maracana stadium on 13 July.", "summary": "巴西传出警方在贫民区打死一名年轻人的消息后，里约热内卢的抗议者与警方发生暴力对抗。"}

Microsoft founder Bill Gates, in London for a Hyde Park rally calling for action to end hunger, said he knew nothing about Prism, adding: \"I don't know any specifics but if there's a court order for companies to do things it's typical that they're obeyed.\" Washington visit ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the parliamentary committee would be \"receiving a full report from GCHQ very shortly and will decide what further action needs to be taken as soon as it receives that information\". Committee members will discuss the claims with US security officials during a planned visit to Washington next week. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has urged the foreign secretary - the minister with responsibility for GCHQ - to make a statement to Parliament on the reports. He told the BBC: \"I am calling on William Hague, as the foreign secretary, to come to the dispatch box of the House of Commons on Monday to set out the government's position and explain how the government will work with the ISC to address the very real public concerns that have emerged.\" Labour's Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said that while the security services need to share information with the UK's closest ally, the US, certain questions need to be answered. He told the BBC: \"I think what we'd like to know is, has this actually had the authority of ministers and how long has it been going on for? \"This is not the traditional route of spookology because normally you would go and get an order and that order would be subject to proper accountability and judicial process. This is something that is, in a sense, possibly through the back door.\" BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the UK already had the ability to request information from internet and other companies through court orders and warrants. \"The question about Prism is whether it is simply an interface with the companies to then get hold of that information, or a kind of dragnet to gather vast amounts of information about everyone to sift through,\" our correspondent said. He added: \"Even more worryingly, was it a means of evading the legal oversight and legal restriction on how they operated?\" Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said ministers were \"going to have to say whether they knew about this and what they have and haven't authorised\". She told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme the big question was \"have our agencies been circumventing the law by this nice little international exchange\"? She added: \"The danger with this and other security policies is that governments say, 'well we'll obey our own laws that protect our citizens but we will then play fast and loose with the freedoms of others on the other side of the Atlantic or wherever'.\" Former Labour MP Kim Howells, who chaired the ISC from 2008-2010, told Today he did not believe \"for one minute\" that intelligence service chiefs would be prepared to \"venture into areas that are clearly illegal without, if you like, the permission of the government\". 'Deeply concerning' Conservative MP David Davis said the claims indicated the intelligence services had \"much more information than they used to have… namely our most intimate traffic\". That could include \"a love email sent to your wife or mistress or girlfriend\", he added. \"That sort of thing's now available through a mechanism which doesn't go through the British courts and that's pretty serious.\" US President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has defended the Prism monitoring programme, saying it was closely overseen by Congress and the courts and that his administration had struck \"the right balance\" between security and privacy. Richard Aldrich, a professor of international security at the University of Warwick, said he expected Mr Cameron to say \"rather as President Obama has said, that you can't have your cake and eat it - you can't have 100% privacy and 100% security\". \"What they're not going to say is, actually, we're very rapidly accelerating to a point where we're going to be in a transparent society,\" he told Today. \"Privacy is effectively a 20th century concept like the steam engine.\" A spokesman for the agency, based in Cheltenham, said: \"Our work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee.\" Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that Twitter was invited to join the Prism programme last year, but rejected the approach from US authorities.", "summary": "美国互联网巨头谷歌（Google）强烈否认该公司允许美国政府访问其服务器。"}

Around 307,764 people died. The figures prompted the interior ministry to call for \"fundamental changes\" to its policies. A declining population puts immense strain on a country. Apart from increased pressure on public spending as demand for healthcare systems and pensions rise, a declining youth population also leads to labour shortages that have a direct impact on the economy. Last month, President Moon Jae-in launched several policies aimed at addressing the low birth rate, including cash incentives for families. Under the scheme, from 2022, every child born will receive a cash bonus of 2 million won ($1,850; £1,350) to help cover prenatal expenses, on top of a monthly payout of 300,000 won handed out until the baby turns one. The incentive will increase to 500,000 won every month from 2025. What's behind South Korea's falling birth rate? Julie Yoon, BBC Korean Largely, it's because in South Korea, women struggle to achieve a balance between work and other life demands. Hyun-yu Kim is one of them. The oldest of four, she dreamed of having a big family of her own. But faced with conditions that are not family friendly in South Korea, she is reconsidering her plans to have children. She recently accepted a new job and had felt anxious about taking time off for maternity leave. \"People tell me that it's safer to build my career first,\" she told the BBC. Soaring real estate prices are another major issue. Ms Kim points out that rapidly rising property prices also discourage young couples. \"In order to have children, you need to have your own home. But this has become an impossible dream in Korea.\" She is also unconvinced by the incentives being offered by the government. \"It's expensive to raise a child.

Thousands of survivors are still desperately waiting for the aid effort to reach them. At least 10,000 people are feared to have been killed. Tacloban is one of the worst affected cities. The BBC's Jon Donnison, who is there, says there does not yet seem to be an effective operation to get help to those in need. This is expected to change over the next few days, he says. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced after the high winds and floodwaters destroyed their homes. Damage to roads and airports has delayed the delivery of aid. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the UN would launch a large-scale humanitarian plan on Tuesday. He called for UN member states to show solidarity with the people of the Philippines. \"We have all seen the heartbreaking images of the impact of this huge storm,\" he said. One of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall, Haiyan - named \"Yolanda\" by Philippine authorities - struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Struggle More than nine million people have been affected in the Philippines. Many are now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. A picture is slowly emerging of the full damage wrought by the storm: A huge international relief effort is under way, but rescue workers have struggled to reach areas cut off since the storm. However, reports from Tacloban say soldiers have been distributing food and water to some residents and the US military has sent marines to the city. The head of the Philippine Red Cross, Richard Gordon, described the situation as \"absolute bedlam\". \"It's only now that they were able to get in and we're beginning just to bring in the necessary food items... as well as water and other things that they need,\" he told the BBC. Jane Cocking, the humanitarian director for Oxfam, said her colleagues witnessed \"complete devastation\". A Philippine military spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday that 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected. The UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, was is her way to the Philippines. A priority of the UN's response teams once on the ground would be the burial of bodies to meet concerns about public health, UN humanitarian official John Ging said. \"We are certainly expecting the worst,\" he added. \"As we get more and more access we find the tragedy of more and more people killed in this typhoon.\" 'Unprecedented' storm Some are questioning what more authorities could have done to prepare for this, just the latest in a string of disasters to hit the nation of more than 7,000 islands. Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the typhoon arrived, but many evacuation centres - schools, churches and government buildings - proved unable to withstand the winds and storm surges. Haiyan brought sustained winds of 235km/h (147mph), with gusts of 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves as high as 15m (45ft). In some places, as much as 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain fell. Officials said looting was widespread and order was proving difficult to enforce. Correspondents say many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. In some areas, the dead are being buried in mass graves. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu, with relief efforts focusing on Tacloban. Other countries have also pledged millions of dollars in assistance. Britain is earmarking £10m ($15); Australia has approved $9m in humanitarian aid to the Philippines; while New Zealand has pledged over $1m. Typhoon Haiyan later made landfall in Vietnam, near the tourist destination of Ha Long Bay, with sustained winds of up to 140 km/h (85mph). Despite losing much of its strength, the storm still felled trees and damaged buildings, with reports of some casualties. Some 600,000 people were evacuated in northern provinces of the country.", "summary": "在菲律宾遭受到超强台风“海燕”的灾情之后，总统阿基诺11日晚宣布全国进入“灾难状态”以加快救援工作。"}

She took the post down after being accused of immoral behaviour, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC she said the row was a result of a culture which hyper-sexualised the female form. \"This body I've been given is not vulgar. It is functional, its purpose is to fulfil the physiological needs of my baby, not to be sexualised,\" she told BBC Kyrgyz. It wasn't only some social media users who disapproved. Her parents, President Almazbek Atambayev and his wife Raisa, were also unhappy. \"They really didn't like it. And it is understandable because the younger generation is less conservative than their parents,\" Ms Shagieva said, speaking at her home on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Ms Shagieva posts actively on social media, including her own artwork and carefully stylized portraits of herself and her husband and baby, often set against the backdrop of wide open landscapes. Breastfeeding is a recurring theme. \"When I'm breastfeeding my child I feel like I'm giving him the best I can give. Taking care of my baby and attending to his needs is more important to me than what people say about me,\" Ms Shagieva said. Who is Aliya Shagieva? Gulnara Kasmambetova, BBC Kyrgyz I interviewed Aliya Shagieva in her flat in a prestigious quarter of Bishkek which she shares with her husband and child. Her drawings and pictures were on the walls and the couple offered fruit and herbal tea. Herbs were growing in pots on the window sills; the couple are vegetarian, a rarity in a traditionally meat-eating country. In the context of a post-Soviet traditional Muslim society, Aliya Shagieva is very bold and very different. She was quite open, sharing her experience of feeling lonely as a child of very busy parents. She spoke of the generation gap and her efforts to understand and find compromise with her parents, not least over her social media activities. \"My mum received messages from her 'friends' about me,\" she said. \"Now that I am a mother myself, I know what my mum went through raising me.\" Aliya has been active supporting causes such as awareness of children with Downs syndrome and animal rights, but has no obvious political ambitions. People in Kyrgyzstan have recent memories of the two previous presidents' children getting involved in politics and business - both leaders were ousted. But the incumbent leader has pledged that his children will never meddle in politics. Kyrgyzstan is a mainly Muslim ex-Soviet republic. It is socially conservative but breast feeding in public is acceptable. Women are seen in parks and other public spaces feeding their babies, but they usually try and cover their breasts with a piece of clothing. When Ms Shagieva's post first went online some social media users thought there was no need to post a picture of such an intimate moment; others denounced her for not being modest enough. And her breastfeeding photos attracted attention well beyond Kyrgyzstan - they were republished by newspapers and websites as far away as Europe. Many took to social media to praise her for breaking taboos surrounding women's bodies. The question of breastfeeding in public is a matter of debate in many countries, including the UK where only three years ago a woman was asked to cover up in the restaurant of London's famous Claridges Hotel while feeding her baby, causing an outcry. When different BBC language services ran the interview with Aliya Shagieva, the resulting online conversation threw a light on different breastfeeding cultures and practices in Muslim countries. Women writing from Iran shared their experiences about the stress they feel when breastfeeding in public: \"People zoom in on me, I have to either cover myself and the baby or just leave him hungry,\" one Tehran mother wrote. Others praised the recently installed mother and baby rooms in Tehran's Metro. An Afghan woman from Kabul, Zarifa Ghafari, shared a story from her own extended family, saying mothers had to go into a separate room to breastfeed: \"She can't do this in front of others. If she did she would face strong reactions from the elder members of the family. It is a big issue but slowly, slowly the culture is changing.\" Another Afghan woman, Nageen related a shopping trip with her sister in law. \"We had to buy some gifts just so she could feed her baby in a shop. She sat there and covered herself with a big scarf.\" A Turkish Facebook user said, she herself preferred covering up while feeding her baby. \"I don't rub it in people's faces. I use a cover. There are many who still sexualize breasts.\" Victoria Tahmasebi, a women and gender studies expert at Toronto university tweeted: \"From a capitalist view point women's breasts can create profit as long as they are sexualised. Breastfeeding in public makes women's breasts less sexy, therefore it is not acceptable.\" As for Aliya Shagieva's picture which caused a stir - she finally took it down because her parents were worried that the attention \"could be harmful to her young family\". But it hasn't stopped her speaking out, and it hasn't stopped the debate.", "summary": "吉尔吉斯斯坦总统女儿穿着内衣哺母乳的照片，引发各方有关喂母乳及性欲化的讨论。"}

The arrests are linked to a plot outlined in material seized last year as part of Operation Appleby. That operation, in September 2014, was sparked by intelligence reports that Islamist extremists were planning random killings in Australia. Then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at the time a senior Australian Islamic State militant had called for \"demonstration killings\", reportedly including a public beheading. Another three people, aged between 21 and 22, were also charged for the same offence on Thursday afternoon. All face potential life sentences if convicted. Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney: \"Continue to thwart attacks\" While its FA-18 fighters bomb so-called Islamic State targets many thousands of kilometres away, and its soldiers train Iraqi forces, Australia continues to confront the enemy within. More counter-terrorism raids in Sydney have yielded further arrests, and will make an uneasy nation even more anxious on the eve of the first anniversary of the deadly Sydney siege. Last month, a poll found that more than half of Australians thought a large-scale attack was likely, and one-quarter was convinced it was inevitable. The prime minister has promised a \"calm, clinical and effective\" response to the menace of home-grown extremism. \"We cannot eliminate entirely the risk of terrorism any more than we can eliminate the risk of any serious crime,\" said Malcolm Turnbull in his first national security address. \"But we can mitigate it. We will continue to thwart and frustrate many attacks before they occur.\" Timeline of recent Australia terror incidents At least 800 heavily armed officers arrested 16 people as part of Operation Appleby in September 2014, in what was Australia's biggest ever anti-terror operation. Police said the arrests on Thursday were not linked to a new plot, but to documents seized during those raids that talked about a plan to target government and police buildings. \"As a result of putting all of that information together, working through those documents, putting physical and electronic surveillance together, we were able to build a case of conspiracy for five people involved in the preparation of these documents,\" said Deputy Commissioner of National Security Michael Phelan. Those arrested on Thursday are also known to those involved in the terror-linked shooting of Sydney police worker Curtis Cheng, police said. Mr Cheng, 58, was shot dead outside his police headquarters office as he left work last October. Police shot dead his attacker, 15-year-old Farhad Jabar, at the scene. New South Wales Police said the 15-year-old boy arrested on Thursday was charged based on activity when he was 14. They added that he had clearly been radicalised, although they did not yet know how it had happened. \"It is disturbing that we continue to deal with teenaged children in this environment,\" said Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn. \"To be putting a 15-year-old before the courts on very serious charges that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment demonstrates the difficulties law enforcement face.\" Police said a total of 11 people had now been charged under Operation Appleby.", "summary": "澳大利亚悉尼警方反恐部门在一次突袭行动中拘捕两名分别为15岁和20岁的男子。"}

In the years since, women had been thrown in jail for voting illegally, organised pickets across the country and chained themselves to the White House demanding representation. Rights were granted in a handful of, mostly western, states over the years but resistance remained. This amendment, officially ratified in 1920, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex on a national level. In 2019 the US has more women in national politics than ever before, but still falls well short of equality. These are the pioneers who have made history in the century since. First women in congress Before the amendment, Jeanette Rankin was elected to the House of Representatives in 1916 remarking: \"I may be the first woman member of Congress, but I won't be the last\". She was a suffragette and lobbyist with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) - an organisation borne out of the frustration over post-civil war reconstruction not advocating for women's rights. She voted against US entry into World War One - a move that would eventually cost her her seat. She then returned to the House in 1940 on an anti-war platform - becoming the only member to vote against US entry in both conflicts. In 1922 Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the US Senate - but only as a symbolic gesture for 24 hours. Ten years later Hattie Ophelia Caraway, from Arkansas, became the first woman ever elected to the chamber. Her husband, Thaddeus, had died in office the year before and a governor had chosen her to fill his seat drawing on something known as the \"widow's mandate\". She then won a special election to serve out the rest of his term and achieved re-election herself in 1938. In spite of the 19th Amendment, racially-targeted voter suppression and disenfranchisement remained a problem throughout the 20th Century. Hawaii representative Patsy Mink became the first woman of colour, and first Asian-American woman, to be elected to the House in 1964. Four years later Shirley Chisholm became the first African-American congresswoman. Born in Brooklyn, she served seven terms and became known as \"Fighting Shirley\" because of her reputation as a champion of racial and gender equality. First female governor In 1925, Nellie Tayloe Ross became the first woman to ever hold a US governor post - elected after the death of her husband. Wyoming, where she served, was the first territory in the US to offer suffrage to women - back in 1869. Despite failing to win re-election, Ross remained in politics and moved to Washington DC. First women to lead political parties Utah-born Jean Westwood became the first ever woman to chair a political party in 1972 - the same year Congress approved the Equal Rights Amendment. The New York Times reported that when she expressed her pride at becoming chairman of the Democratic National Committee she was heckled by audience members saying she should be a chairwoman or chairperson instead. \"I'm proud to be your chairman,\" she reiterated and the matter was settled, according to the newspaper. The Republican party followed two years later, when Mary Louise Smith succeeded future president George HW Bush as their chair. She was a political moderate and took over in the midst of the party's recovery from the Watergate scandal. First female Supreme Court justice Of the 114 Supreme Court justices in US history - a staggering 110 have been men. The first woman to be nominated to the top court was Sandra Day O'Connor - on the back of a 1980 election campaign pledge by Ronald Reagan. O'Connor was from Arizona and was unanimously confirmed at a 1981 Senate vote. She was followed in 1993 by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, nominated by Bill Clinton. President Obama nominated two more women to the Supreme Court - Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. First female attorney general President Bill Clinton chose Janet Reno to lead the US Justice Department in 1993. As Attorney General, she oversaw some of the most notorious events in US history including the Waco siege and the Oklahoma City bombing. During her tenure, she received a lot of media scrutiny about her physical appearance, especially her 6ft 1in frame. She was portrayed by actor Will Ferrell on Saturday Night Live - but turned the joke around in 2006 when she appeared alongside him in a sketch. First female secretary of state President Clinton also nominated the first female secretary of state in US History - Madeleine Albright. Born Marie Jana Korbel in then-Czechoslovakia, her family fled to England when the Nazis invaded. Her father was also a diplomat and negotiated their refuge into the US after the war. Having previously worked under Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brezensinki, Ms Albright was named as US ambassador to the UN in 1993. As secretary of state, from 1997 to 2001, she became known for her firm commitment to human rights. In 2005, Condoleezza Rice became the second woman, and first African-American woman, to hold the post. First female speaker The incumbent speaker of the House of Representatives is also the first, and only, woman to hold the role. Nancy Pelosi, 79, has led the Democrats in the lower house since 2003, and first became the speaker in 2007. Following the 2018 mid-term results, she returned to the position and is spearheading congressional opposition to President Trump. She comes from a family heavily involved in politics, with both her father and brother serving as mayor of Baltimore. Ms Pelosi herself rose up the party ranks in California, where she lived with her family - serving as DNC rep for the state from the 1970s before making the leap into national public office in 1987. Most women in congress The amount of women in Congress has been steadily on the rise since the early 1990s - but the record amount of 127 at present still sits far short of parity. Today, only about 25% of national lawmakers are women. Nevertheless, the 116th Congress has received widespread praised for its progressive representation. Notable firsts include the youngest member of Congress elected ever - Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. The 2018 success, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, drew comparisons to the previous \"Year of the Woman\" in 1992. In that year, the total amount of women jumped from 32 to 54 in one vote. Many linked the female success rate to high-profile sexual misconduct cases playing out in public at that time - including Clarence Thomas being confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of harassment lodged by Anita Hill. That year six women were elected to the Senate - at a time when they did not even yet have a designated female bathroom nearby. Potty parity, as it has come to be known, is considered a key marker of institutional misogyny. It took until 2011 for the House of Representatives to get a female restroom nearby to the voting floor. It wasn't until the 1990s for old-fashioned attitudes about congresswomen's appearance to change too. On one weekend in 1993, Barbara Mikulski - the longest serving female lawmaker ever - plotted a \"pantsuit\" protest against how women were expected to wear skirts. She and Senator Nancy Kassebaum told female staffers to show up to Congress in trousers - a move that apparently prompted \"a big stir\" but ultimately helped break the norm. First women on a presidential ticket Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to ever be on a major party's presidential ticket, chosen as running mate for Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in the 1984 election. Unfortunately for them both, Mondale lost heavily to Republican Ronald Reagan - who came out in top in 49 of 50 states. Sarah Palin became the first Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008. The late Senator John McCain was the lead candidate on the ticket - but they lost to Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden. So far no woman has served as vice-president of the United States. First female president? Of course, the dream of a female US president is still also unfulfilled. Well before Hillary Clinton, other women had also put themselves forward for the top office. Among them was Margaret Chase Smith, a pioneer against McCarthyism who ran for the Republican nomination in the 1964 presidential race. Her candidacy spurned sexist news coverage including an undue focus on her appearance and age that male candidates avoided. She was largely without campaign financing - and lost all her primaries - but nonetheless became the first to have her name on the ballot at a major party's convention. \"When people keep telling you, you can't do a thing, you kind of like to try,\" she said. Others, including the first African-American Senator Carol Moseley Braun, also failed in their nomination attempts after this. It took until Hillary Clinton's primary victory in 2016 for a woman to eventually win a major party's candidacy. Clinton already had an impressive public office pedigree - in 2001 becoming the first former first lady to win a political seat of her own. She had ran for the Democratic nomination in 2008 but conceded to Barack Obama, before serving as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. On 8 November 2016, the date women could vote for a female president for the first time, many travelled to suffragette graves to leave \"I voted\" stickers. However, in a massive political upset, Clinton lost. She had edged the popular vote overall, but lost the electoral college. Key swing states, including Florida and Pennsylvania, flipped to Donald Trump and the Republican party - dashing hopes of a female president. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election Democrats are now lining up to take on President Trump. This includes six women who have already announced their candidacy - a new record in itself. Whether or not this means the US may eventually get its first female president, a century on from the 19th Amendment's ratification, time will tell. Reporting by Kelly-Leigh Cooper.

China is facing mounting criticism over its planned law. Many people in Hong Kong fear it could end their unique freedoms, which the rest of China does not have. The UK is already in talks with allies including the US and Australia about what to do if China imposes the new law - which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority - and people start fleeing Hong Kong. In the Times on Wednesday, the prime minister confirmed that if China passes the law, people in Hong Kong who hold British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports will be allowed to come to the UK for 12 months without a visa. Currently they are allowed to come for six months. Around 350,000 people in Hong Kong currently already have a BNO passport, but 2.6 million others are also eligible. Passport-holders would also be given further immigration rights, including the right to work. This \"could place them on a route to citizenship,\" Mr Johnson said. 'Britain will not walk away' The prime minister added that the immigration changes \"would amount to one of the biggest changes in our visa system in British history\". \"If it proves necessary, the British government will take this step and take it willingly. \"Many people in Hong Kong fear their way of life, which China pledged to uphold, is under threat. \"If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative.\" The last British governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the offer of support from the UK government was \"morally and politically right\". He accused China's ruling Communist Party of employing \"bullying\" tactics, adding: \"Sooner or later with a bully you have to stand up to them, otherwise you'll get knocked about.\" Asked whether the UK was entering a new Cold War with China, Lord Patten told the BBC's World at One: \"I think we're entering a period of realism with China... \"This is not us against China, it's the way in which the Chinese Communist regime can't stand us, and they've cracked down on Hong Kong because it represents all the things which [President] Xi Jinping dislikes.\" Hong Kong is a former British colony. It was handed back to China in 1997. As part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law. BNO passports were granted to all Hong Kong citizens born before the Chinese handover in 1997 and while they allow the holder some protection from the UK foreign service they do not currently give the right to live or work in Britain. There has been widespread international criticism of China's proposed law and the UK government's announcement marks a step up in Britain's opposition to it. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was in talks with countries in the Five Eyes alliance about how to handle a potential \"exodus\" of people from the area. He urged China to reconsider its plans which, he said, would threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity. Senior MPs from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have urged the United Nations to appoint a special envoy to Hong Kong to monitor how the new law affects human rights.

To really know that, we'd have to watch how cases change in one place across the year. But we can look at its spread in different climates across the world for clues. What's the evidence? There is some evidence coronavirus cases have particularly clustered around cooler, drier regions. One study indicated countries particularly affected by the virus - those where it was spreading undetected via community transmission - by 10 March had lower average temperatures than those with fewer cases. Another paper looked at 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases of Covid-19 and suggested the higher the temperature and humidity, the lower the rate of transmission. And another, not yet peer-reviewed, study suggested that although cases of the new coronavirus could be found all over the world, outbreaks had particularly clustered in \"relatively cool and dry areas\" - at least until 23 March. But, as a group of researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pointed out, the virus has now spread to every World Health Organization region, \"effectively spanning all climatic zones, from cold and dry to hot and humid regions\". Is there a north-south divide? With lots of other viruses, including flu, a seasonal pattern is seen in the northern and southern hemispheres. But tropical regions close to the equator don't experience the same pattern. And some of the hot and humid regions that have seen locally transmitted cases of the Covid-19 virus, such as Malaysia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are close to the equator and so might not provide the best evidence for what will happen elsewhere. But looking to the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand - at the tail-end of their summer season when their first cases were seen - have had far fewer cases than many of their northern-hemisphere counterparts. There are lots of other factors at play, such as global footfall and the density of the population. And since the virus has gradually spread around the world - initially through global travel - at the same time as seasons have been changing, it's difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate specifically. Are other coronaviruses seasonal? There is some evidence other coronaviruses mainly circulate in the winter months, according to a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The researchers asked almost 2,000 people for a weekly report on whether anyone in their household had symptoms of respiratory illness. And anyone with symptoms was asked to send in a swab for testing for a range of viruses. From this, the researchers observed large peaks in coronavirus cases in the winter, around the same time as flu season. There were a small number of cases in the summer. One of the study's authors, Ellen Fragaszy, at UCL said it was therefore \"possible we will see a bit of a relief in cases over the summer\". But we could not be sure this is how the new coronavirus would behave. And the large number of cases and their spread across the world suggested we shouldn't be too hopeful of a summer respite. Is this virus like other coronaviruses? The new coronavirus, called Sars-Cov-2, which causes the Covid-19 disease, appears to spread in basically the same way as other coronaviruses. But what makes it distinct is the how ill it makes you and the number of deaths it causes. Dr Michael Head, at the University of Southampton, said the development and impact of the novel coronavirus was \"clearly very different from the existing 'common cold' type coronaviruses\". \"It remains to be seen as to whether Covid-19 cases will decline in response to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity,\" he said.

The government said people still saw university as a good investment. The UCU academics' union said the figures highlighted the recklessness of raising fees to £9,000. Anyone wishing to apply after 30 June will have to do so through clearing. The reduction in applications has remained steady for the past few months, according to admissions service, Ucas. But these latest figures come a few weeks before the final deadline for regular applications to university. The main deadline passed in mid-January. 'Financial barriers' Overall, applications from the UK fell 7.7%. The drop was at its biggest in England, at 10%, where students are having to bear the full cost of their university education - albeit through government-backed loans. In Wales, where students are partly subsidised, applicants dropped just 2.7%. In Scotland, where applicants who have been living there for three years or more pay nothing, the drop was 2.2%. Applications from Northern Ireland, where fees were pegged at 2011 levels, went down 4.4%. Students studying outside Northern Ireland have to pay full fees in other countries.

What the research revealed was that she was the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and the daughter of the company's founder. It was at that moment that border officials realised they were about to be plunged into the centre of a major international incident which, nearly two years on, has not gone away. The woman was Meng Wanzhou whose flight from Hong Kong arrived at Gate 65 at 11:10 local time. She was on a stopover in Canada, where she has two homes, before heading on to business meetings in Mexico. Further details of what took place at the airport have been revealed in a Vancouver court in the past week as part of the latest stage of legal battle that could stretch on for years. Her lawyers are pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to prevent her being extradited to the US on charges of misleading the bank HSBC in a way which might lead to it breaking US sanctions on Iran. Ms Meng's lawyers have been arguing that there was abuse of process in the way the arrest was carried out. One of the issues they raised is why Meng was questioned for nearly three hours by officers from Canadian Border Services Agency before she was formally arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Her lawyers are looking for signs that proper procedures were not followed in what unfolded in those hours. Ms Meng, who appeared in court wearing the security ankle bracelet that is required for her bail, was described as \"calm\" during her initial questioning at the airport because she had no idea what was coming next. Border officials took her phones and devices and placed them in a special bag - designed to prevent any electronic interference. Border officials also got her passwords and PIN codes for the devices but the court heard that they mistakenly handed these, along with the devices, over to the RCMP when they technically should not have done. It was just after 14:00 when this questioning was over that she was met by a police officer who explained to Ms Meng that she was being arrested and was entitled to a lawyer. The police officer who eventually arrested her after the border questioning was challenged in court as to why he did not do so earlier. Her lawyers are looking for evidence a co-ordinated plan by border agency and police - perhaps with the guiding hand of the US behind them - to improperly detain and question her without a lawyer. Officials deny this and say the border questioning was to establish whether there was any reason she could not be admitted, for instance involvement in espionage. The police officer also testified \"safety\" concerns were one reason he did not arrest Ms Meng immediately after her Cathay Pacific 777 flight landed. This part of the legal battle will focus on whether procedures were followed and if not, whether that was due to simple mistakes or the result of any plan. The arrest has caused a serious diplomatic crisis between Canada and China, with allegations that two Canadians have been arrested in China on national security charges as a bargaining chip over Ms Meng's detention. The legal battle over her extradition is likely to go on for months and perhaps years with appeals on different issues leaving relations between the two countries in a difficult state and Ms Meng still in Canada.", "summary": "2018年12月1日，一名加拿大边境工作人员在互联网上匆忙做了一些信息搜寻，结果令他“震惊不已”。"}

The characters on stage ask audience members to take a selfie on their phones and then email them to a researcher who is tapping away on a computer at the back of the set. To reveal what happens to the photos would be a spoiler, but they are a key part of James Graham's new play - which examines the digital footprint all of us are leaving online. Graham admits that until the first preview he had no idea whether audiences would participate in the interactive side of the play. \"There could have been a version of this show where people didn't want to get involved. The first time people lifted up their phones to take a selfie was the most thrilling I've had in the theatre.\" Graham had a big hit in 2012 with his political drama This House at the National's Cottesloe Theatre. It transferred to the Olivier in 2013 where it had a sell-out run. Later that year, Graham and the Donmar's artistic director Josie Rourke began discussing the idea of a play that would explore how governments and corporations collect and use personal information. Things properly took shape in the wake of Edward Snowden's National Security Agency (NSA) revelations leaked to The Guardian last summer. Snowden isn't a character in the play but several Guardian journalists are, as well as politicians Lord Paddy Ashdown, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. There are even characters based on Graham and Rourke - The Writer and The Director, played by Joshua McGuire and Michelle Terry respectively. While Privacy draws on verbatim interviews with politicians, journalists and campaigners it also relies on data gathered from the audience each night. It means no two performances are the same. \"We can't get all the information for the show until it starts at 7.30,\" says Rourke. \"It's tremendously exciting but it makes for some seat-of-the-pants stuff.\" Graham adds: \"It requires a brilliant cast who walk out on stage every night and don't quite know 100% what is going to happen.\" As well as sending selfies, the audience is encouraged to Google for pizza and delve into their phone settings. \"Part of the ambition of the show is to have people understand the relationship between them and the data,\" says Rourke. Graham asserts he didn't want to create a dystopian vision. \"It's not meant to be provocatively implying we should all dump our iPhones in the dustbin or go into the cellar,\" adds Graham. \"I genuinely believe that a lot of this stuff is exciting. It's great that Google allows us to search the internet. It's great that Facebook provides me a capacity to connect with my friends. \"But what's important is to make sure we have that conversation about the nature of that contract. I think the danger is that you sleepwalk into a culture where you don't question that. \"At 13 or 14 you just assume that Facebook is like water or electricity. A lot of this stuff is amazing but we have to ask if the balance is right.\" Graham points out the volume of information we share about ourselves has changed radically in the last five years in a way it hasn't in the last 500. So has his work on Privacy changed his own online habits? \"I'm aware of what I share. When I click 'tweet' or 'status update' I'm more conscious that I'm actually publishing. I make a choice to publish that thought and I know that might come back to haunt me.\" Rourke, meanwhile, will be happy to see the faces of the audience glowing in the light of their mobiles at the Donmar over the next six weeks. \"As a director you spend a lot of time trying to get people to switch their phones off before a show, so its hugely refreshing to let them leave them on.\" Privacy runs at the Donmar Warehouse until 31 May.", "summary": "剧场通常都会要求观众在开场前关闭手机。但一部名为《隐私》(Privacy)的新剧不仅要求剧场观众的手机保持开机状态，还在演出中让观众玩自拍。"}

The numbers suggest the strategy worked: the International Energy Agency says China buys more than half of the world's new electric cars. Now, the government is set to push the burden onto manufacturers, through a new \"cap and trade\" system and rules that make it harder to set up a factory to make combustion-engine cars. The rules were believed to have come into force on 1 January this year. Small but growing rapidly China is both the biggest manufacturer and the biggest market for cars globally. But after two decades of rapid expansion, sales fell in 2018 by 6% to 22.7 million units. The most recent figures show that New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) - a category which includes electric and hybrid models - has defied that trend, growing substantially over the past year. However, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) says 601,000 NEVs were sold in the first three quarters of 2018, which means they still account only for a small fraction of the market. How do the new rules work? The National Reform and Development Commission has said it won't allow the establishment of new companies that only make combustion-engine cars. It has also imposed additional conditions for existing companies that plan to set up a factory for cars that aren't NEVs. New quotas on electric vehicles are also expected to have an impact on manufacturers. Under a new \"cap and trade\" system, any company that makes 30,000 cars or more needs to earn enough credits to match 10% of its output. So a car company manufacturing the minimum would need to earn 3,000 credits. But not all cars are treated equally. A NEV can receive between two and six credits depending on how far it can travel before being recharged. So if a carmaker makes 30,000 cars, it could hit its quota by manufacturing 1,000 cars with three credits each. Any company that doesn't reach its quota faces a fine, but carmakers that expect to fall short can buy credits from manufacturers which have a surplus. This means carmakers who don't reach their quota directly subsidise manufacturers who do. Analysts say that could be very appealing to overseas manufacturers, which currently make the most efficient NEVs. \"If Tesla starts manufacturing in China, they will get the highest credit. If they sell a sufficient number of vehicles, they will be able to sell to other [manufacturers] at a credit,\" according to Vivek Vaidya, from consultancy Frost and Sullivan. China at the forefront China has been aggressively pursuing NEVs, both to cut air pollution and to develop a strong industry. The Chinese government has had subsidies in place for nearly a decade, and these have been supplemented by subsidies from regional governments. In some cities, public transport has also led the way. Shenzhen's fleet of 16,000 buses is now 100% electric and its fleet of taxis is almost completely electric too. In addition to a robust local industry, many global manufacturers are already in the Chinese NEV market, mostly through joint-venture arrangements, including Nissan, Toyota, VW, BMW and Volvo. GM says it's on track to deliver 10 NEV models by 2020 and plans to double that number over the following three years. Tesla has just broken ground on its gigafactory, just outside Shanghai. An end to subsidies? This latest move appears at least partly to be an attempt to wean the market off subsidies. \"This law is really to help replace the subsidy the Chinese government offers now on purchasing NEVs in China and pushes that responsibility onto the car manufacturer,\" according to Tu Le, from research firm Sino Auto Insights. In Beijing and Shanghai, for example, drivers who buy an NEV are currently given a license plate for free, while other drivers have to participate in a lottery in Beijing or an auction in Shanghai. In other Chinese cities, subsidies and rebates are given to buyers who purchase NEVs. Growing pains There are a number of issues that could, at least in the short term, create some difficulties. There have already been reports that China's electric carmakers have taken an initial hit on the stock market over fears about the removal of subsidies. Tu Le says a lack of electrification infrastructure could also weigh on sales and the trade war could be a wild card. \"If the trade war is not resolved within the first quarter of 2019, then this could have significant negative effects on the overall sales of cars and customers' willingness to take a chance on new technologies,\" he said. How will it affect the market for electric cars? Vivek Vaidya expects the new plan to succeed, mostly because manufacturers will have a strong incentive to make more electric and hybrid cars. He also thinks some Chinese market leaders could expand their reach beyond the mainland. But unless you live in a developing market, it's not very likely a Chinese electric vehicle will be driving down your street any time soon. \"Chinese vehicles are very competitively priced, but it's not apple to apple comparison. They might not dominate a market like Germany, but they might target Asian markets like India and Indonesia,\" he said.", "summary": "在中国之外，很少有车主听说过比亚迪（BYD）或者北汽（北京汽车制造厂Beijing Automobile Works）这两个汽车品牌。但在电动汽车领域，这两个品牌已经占据全世界的第一和第二把交椅。"}

Changing the definition is vital to ensure laws stay appropriate, they write in an opinion piece in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal. But another expert warns doing so risks \"further infantilising young people\". When puberty begins Puberty is considered to start when the part of the brain known as the hypothalamus starts releasing a hormone that activates the body's pituitary and gonadal glands. This used to happen around the age of 14 but has dropped with improved health and nutrition in much of the developed world to around the age of 10. As a consequence, in industrialised countries such as the UK the average age for a girl's first menstruation has dropped by four years in the past 150 years. Half of all females now have their period by 12 or 13 years of age. When the body stops developing There are also biological arguments for why the definition of adolescence should be extended, including that the body continues to develop. For example, the brain continues to mature beyond the age of 20, working faster and more efficiently. And many people's wisdom teeth don't come through until the age of 25. Delaying life's milestones Young people are also getting married and having children later. According to the Office of National Statistics, the average age for a man to enter their first marriage in 2013 was 32.5 years and 30.6 years for women across England and Wales. This represented an increase of almost eight years since 1973. Lead author Prof Susan Sawyer, director of the centre for adolescent health at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, writes: \"Although many adult legal privileges start at age 18 years, the adoption of adult roles and responsibilities generally occurs later.\" She says delayed partnering, parenting and economic independence means the \"semi-dependency\" that characterises adolescence has expanded. Social policy This social change, she says, needs to inform policy, such as by extending youth support services until the age of 25. \"Age definitions are always arbitrary\", she writes, but \"our current definition of adolescence is overly restricted\". \"The ages of 10-24 years are a better fit with the development of adolescents nowadays.\" Prof Russell Viner, president-elect of the Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, said: \"In the UK, the average age for leaving home is now around 25 years for both men and women.\" He supports extending the definition to cover adolescence up until the age of 24 and says a number of UK services already take this into account. He said: \"Statutory provision in England in terms of social care for care leavers and children with special educational needs now goes up to 24 years,\" as does provision of services for people with cystic fibrosis. 'Infantilising young people' But Dr Jan Macvarish, a parenting sociologist at the University of Kent, says there is a danger in extending our concept of adolescence. \"Older children and young people are shaped far more significantly by society's expectations of them than by their intrinsic biological growth,\" she said. \"There is nothing inevitably infantilising about spending your early 20s in higher education or experimenting in the world of work.\" And we should not risk \"pathologising their desire for independence\". \"Society should maintain the highest possible expectations of the next generation,\" Dr Macvarish said. Prof Viner disagrees with Dr Macvarish's criticism and says broadening adolescence can be seen as \"empowering young people by recognising their differences\". \"As long as we do this from a position of recognising young people's strengths and the potential of their development, rather than being focused on the problems of the adolescent period.\"", "summary": "科学家认为，青春期应从10岁持续到24岁。过去普遍认为青春期在19岁结束。"}

Jo Floto, BBC News, Beijing: \"Off the scale\" On Friday the skies have been blue and pollution levels are very low for Beijing standards. But in the next few hours the winds are predicted to drop and pollution levels will steadily rise. If nothing is done, they will rise to hazardous levels - more probably to levels that are literally off the scale. The government is coming under increasing pressure to deal with the problem. After truly atrocious smog at the end of November, with particulate pollution measured at almost 30 times the recommended level, there was much criticism that not enough was being done. After the first red alert, they claimed to have reduced pollution by a third, they'll be hoping to do the same over the next few days. They'll also be watching the public mood. Long-term exposure to high levels of dangerous particulate matter in smog - PM2.5 - has been linked to lung damage and respiratory illnesses. The World Health Organization considers PM2.5 readings of 25 micrograms per cubic metre as the maximum safe level. The smog which hit Beijing on 8 December peaked just below 300. Residents are encouraged to stay indoors if levels exceed that level. Meteorological authorities have said this time the smog is expected to exceed 500 micrograms per cubic metre. Authorities released a map showing that smog would blanket a swathe of the country spanning nearly 2,000km (1,200 miles), encompassing at least 12 major cities, with Beijing and nearby city Shijiazhuang heaviest hit. What are PM 2.5 particles? The news of the new red alert was greeted with exasperation and worry among Chinese citizens. Beijing resident Cheng Xianke expressed concern for the health of the elderly and children. He told Reuters: \"For us who commute to work it's not so bad but still I'm very concerned about the pollution. I think the government needs to put more effort into solving this.\" Another resident, Fan Xiaoting, told the news agency that the alert would affect school teaching timetables: \"We are paying close attention as to whether stopping the classes will have further implications.\" Coal-powered industries and heating systems - in heavy use during the cold Beijing winter - are major contributors to the smog. It is made worse by weather conditions and the city's geography - it is bordered to the south and east by heavily polluting industrial areas, and to the north and west by mountains that trap the dirty air over the city. China still depends on coal for more than 60% of its power, despite big investments in renewable energy sources. Earlier this month China was part of the landmark Paris climate change agreement, that set a course for China, and the world, to move away from fossil fuels in the long term.", "summary": "北京当局在周五（12月18日）预先通知将启动空气重污染红色预警，这是一个多星期里的第二次。"}

His death was first announced after a 2010 shootout, but no body was found and he was reportedly seen alive since. Police said he was finally tracked down and shot dead in Michoacan state. \"From a fingerprint analysis we have confirmed 100% that this was Nazario Moreno Gonzalez,\" said Tomas Zeron, the head of investigations at the federal prosecutor's office. 'Dangerous person' Government security spokesman Alejandro Rubido said security officials had been tracking Moreno for some time. \"Anonymous tips indicated that Nazario Moreno was not only living, but continued operating at the head of a criminal group conducting extortion, kidnapping and other crimes,\" he said at a news briefing in Mexico City. \"This person was known as dangerous,\" he said, with police believing he had committed multiple murders since his reported death. Mr Rubido said Moreno was stopped by police on Sunday morning in the village of Tumbiscatio in Michoacan state. \"When he was asked to turn himself in, he opened fire and was killed,\" he said. Moreno, 43, was the founder of the La Familia cartel, which dominated the drugs trade in Michoacan but was believed to have been severely weakened by his reported death. Its breakaway group, the Knights Templar - know for its brutality and its use of religious imagery - subsequently took over many of the cartel's operations and runs much of the methamphetamine production and trafficking in the west of Mexico. The BBC's Mexico correspondent Will Grant says Moreno's killing is a second major success for the government's campaign against the drugs trade within a month. In late February, Joaquin Guzman, known as El Chapo or \"Shorty\" was arrested in Sinaloa state. His Sinaloa cartel is believed to be one of the biggest criminal organisations in the world, trafficking drugs into more than 50 countries worldwide. He was one of Mexico's most-wanted men and had been on the run since escaping a high-security prison in a laundry basket in 2001. Some 60,000 people have died across Mexico since 2006 when the previous government under Felipe Calderon deployed the military against the drugs gangs.", "summary": "墨西哥司法官员说，墨西哥警方击毙了一名被认为在三年前就已经被击毙的毒品犯罪团伙头目。"}

UUK says a volatile economic climate contributes to a challenging future for the higher education sector. The government said its reforms had created a more competitive sector. Under these changes, fees have tripled, with universities allowed to charge up to £9,000 a year. And changes to admissions allowed institutions, from last autumn, to admit as many students with at least two A grades and a B at A-level as they liked. From this autumn this will be lowered to students with ABB. 'Uncertain times' In its report, The Funding Environment for Universities, UUK says institutions have shown a \"readiness to embrace change\", by adapting their financial strategies to \"prepare for uncertain times ahead\". But it says funding challenges lie ahead for universities in the short to medium term. The study says that in 2012, the first year of the tuition fee hike, England's universities recruited around 28,000 fewer students than expected. This drop in student numbers, which was about 9% lower than anticipated, came amid a decline in the number of 18-year-olds, changes in the numbers of students deferring degree places and fears by universities that they would face financial penalties for under or over-recruiting students, the report says. The research also found a fall in postgraduate students and \"significant\" reductions in 2012-13 in the numbers of new entrants to UK universities from countries such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria. This trend is set against a backdrop of tighter rules on student immigration, which affect student entry requirements, their entitlements during their studies and their options after they graduate. UUK says the proportion of universities meeting their international recruitment targets fell by 7% between 2011-12 and 2012-13. It says the failure for student numbers to grow at the same rate as in 2010-11 means that the UK has already missed out on millions of pounds. 'Unprecedented changes' In his introduction to the report, Professor Eric Thomas, UUK president and vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: \"From 2011 to the present day and beyond, the UK's universities are experiencing unprecedented changes in the policy environment, in the funding of higher education and in the recruitment of international students.\" This was happening against a backdrop of a \"volatile\" economic situation and changes in the population. Prof Thomas said: \"The UK's universities have demonstrated their readiness to embrace change by modifying their financial strategies to prepare for uncertain times ahead. \"However, this report finds that institutions face a number of challenges in the short to medium term in funding capital expenditure. \"There is also evidence to suggest that the sector is significantly constrained in terms of its ability to expand in a sustainable manner in the medium term. \"This has long-term implications for the UK's skilled workforce, productivity and economic growth.\" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said higher education across the world was changing rapidly. \"Our reforms have laid the foundations for a better funded and more competitive sector, with a ring-fenced research budget, more resources for teaching, and a renewed focus on the quality of the student experience. \"We are delivering more choice to students by relaxing number controls and ensuring a more diverse sector. \"With the demand for higher education growing worldwide, we are developing an industrial strategy for education exports to ensure the UK's universities can take advantage of the growing international appetite for learning.\"", "summary": "最新报告警告，英国高教经费，海外学生的招生和学费等改变，让未来几年英国大学面临财政挑战。"}

Chazelle is up for best film director and it is also nominated for original screenplay, score and song. Coming-of-age drama Moonlight is close behind with six nominations, including best drama film. British actress Naomie Harris is up for best supporting actress for her role as a drug addict in the film. Manchester by the Sea, about a caretaker who finds himself taking in his teenage nephew, has five nods - best drama film, original screenplay, director for Kenneth Lonergan, actor for Casey Affleck and supporting actress for Michelle Williams. The other best drama actor nominees are Joel Edgerton for Loving, Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge, Viggo Mortensen for Captain Fantastic and Denzel Washington for Fences. Natalie Portman is favourite for the best drama actress award for playing Jacqueline Kennedy in the biopic Jackie. She will face competition from Arrival's Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain for Miss Sloane, Isabelle Huppert for Elle and Ruth Negga for Loving. World War II biopic Hacksaw Ridge, Texan family drama Hell or High Water and Indian/Australian coming-of-age movie Lion are also up for best drama film. BBC series The Night Manager has fared well in the TV categories, with nods for its British stars Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie. It is also up for best limited series. Analysis - Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent The Golden Globe nominations contained few real surprises and in many ways have confirmed, rather than changed the direction of this year's film awards race, which will culminate with the Oscars in February. Since it opened the Venice Film Festival in August, La La Land has been seen as the frontrunner for best film and best director at the Academy Awards, with its main rivals remaining Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea. Although the Golden Globes offers twice as many lead acting categories as the Baftas or the Oscars, today has done little to change the perception that Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) and Emma Stone (La La Land) remain the favourites for the best actor and best actress Academy Awards. Perhaps most notable is the performance of Moonlight, with just one nomination fewer than La La Land. The Miami-set story of a young black man dealing with his sexuality now looks like the leading film to help end the race controversy of the last two years, with Mahershala Ali heavily tipped to win best supporting actor. And while Fences performed less strongly overall, Viola Davis is also thought likely to win best supporting actress. A welcome sign that after two years of #OscarsSoWhite, next year's Academy Awards nominations are likely to be more diverse - and on top of that the favourites to win in two of the acting categories are black. Olivia Colman faces fellow Brit Thandie Newton (Westworld) for best supporting actress in a limited TV series, as well as Game of Thrones star Lena Heady plus Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore, who are both recognised for family comedy drama This Is Us. The Night Of's British star Riz Ahmed is nominated alongside Hiddleston for best actor in a limited TV series. They are up against Bryan Cranston for All the Way, John Turturro for for The Night Of and Courtney B Vance for American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People. American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People is also recognised, with acting nominations for John Travolta, Sterling K Brown and Sarah Paulson alongside Vance. The drama is also up for best limited series. In the movie categories, Disney's Zootopia and Moana are among those up for best animated feature film, alongside Kubo and the Strings, My Life as A Zucchini and Sing. Florence Foster Jenkins, based on the true story of a New York heiress who dreams of being an opera star, has four nominations, including a 30th Golden Globe nod for Meryl Streep and one for Hugh Grant. It is also up for best comedy or musical film alongside La La Land, 20th Century Woman, Deadpool and Irish film Sing Street, which was written and directed by Once film-maker John Carney. Other actors recognised in the musical/comedy category include Colin Farrell (The Lobster), Jonah Hill (War Dogs) and Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool). Alongside La La Land's Stone and Streep in best actress in a musical or comedy film category are Lily Collins (Rules Don't Apply), Hailee Steinfeld (The Edge of Seventeen) and Annette Bening (20th Century Women). Sully, starring Tom Hanks, was a notable omission from the list, as was with Martin Scorsese's Silence.

He appeared at the end of a video last month which showed fellow US journalist James Foley being killed. A militant in the latest video also threatens to kill a British hostage. Mr Sotloff's family said they were aware of the video and were \"grieving privately\". After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports. The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq. President Barack Obama has ordered the deployment of another 350 troops to Baghdad to protect US diplomatic facilities, the White house has said. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This second hostage killing video from IS is significant, even though it was largely expected and dreaded. It shows that the recent US air strikes which have halted IS's lightning advance across northern Iraq are causing the organisation real damage, upsetting its plans to extend by force its rule into Kurdistan. Unable to hit back militarily against America's jets, Islamic State has responded with a form of information warfare that it knows will horrify most people in the West. Secondly, by threatening to murder a British hostage, IS shows it makes little or no distinction between the US and Britain as its enemy. This is despite Britain so far restricting itself to dropping aid to refugees and flying in supplies to the Kurdish military, leaving air strikes to the Americans. 'Arrogant policy' The video, entitled \"A second message to America\", is about two-and-a-half minutes long and was apparently recorded in a desert. It appears to have been filmed after Mr Foley's, though it is impossible to determine the exact timing. It shows a masked figure together with Mr Sotloff, who is dressed in an orange gown. Mr Sotloff reads out a text addressed to Mr Obama saying: \"You've spent billions of US taxpayers' dollars and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?\" The masked man, whose voice is similar to that of the man who appeared to carry out the beheading of James Foley, then describes the act he is about to commit as retribution for the US air strikes. \"I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State... despite our serious warnings,\" the man says. \"We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.\" The video ends with the militant threatening to kill the British captive. 'Absolutely disgusting' US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: \"If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act.\" She said it was believed that \"a few\" other Americans were still being held by Islamic State. Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video. \"Our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are with Mr Sotloff and Mr Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,\" he said. \"I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports. \"It's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity.\" UK Prime Minister David Cameron described the apparent beheading as an \"absolutely disgusting, despicable act\". Mr Cameron's office said he has known for months that a Briton was among the hostages taken by Islamic State and has chaired meetings with high-level officials to discuss the situation. But British officials say they have deliberately not commented on this while there has been what they call \"strong family liaison\" with relatives of the hostage. 'Unbiased observer' A friend of Mr Sotloff, US film maker Matthew Van Dyke, told the BBC: \"He was a complete professional and there was no reason for this to happen to him.\" Mr Sotloff was abducted near Aleppo in northern Syria in August 2013. He had worked for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and the Christian Science Monitor, and reported from Egypt, Libya and Syria. Time Magazine editor Nancy Gibbs said in a statement that she was \"shocked and deeply saddened by reports of Steven Sotloff's death\". \"He gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world,\" she said. Friends said he had lived in Yemen for many years and spoke good Arabic. Last month a video was released showing the beheading of Mr Foley. Mr Sotloff was shown at the end, as a militant gave a warning that his fate depended on President Obama's next move. The US has launched more than 120 air strikes in Iraq in the last month, in an attempt to help Kurdish forces curb the advance of Islamic State militants and protect minorities threatened by them.", "summary": "伊斯兰国公布的一段视频显示，被激进组织扣押的人质——美国记者斯蒂文·索特洛夫被斩首。"}

That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again. Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's \"Golden week\" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal. And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things. Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to. It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Rising unemployment Compounding all of that - are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The \"true level of unemployment is likely double this\", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is. It is saying that this year \"it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,\" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff. It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. \"Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,\" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances. \"You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,\" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. \"Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. \" This time it's different The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing. But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people. This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. \"No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. \"Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.\" 'Chinese dream' under pressure For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the \"Chinese dream\" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan.", "summary": "按照经济学家们的说法，中国的经济数据不可信，但是经济学家们现在遇到了新的难题——中国没有了经济数据。"}

President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election, has embarked on an ambitious infrastructure push. To do it he has welcomed Chinese investment and accepted loans and partnerships with foreign companies. His rival, former military general Prabowo Subianto, has accused the president of selling out the country to foreigners, and opposition lawmakers are claiming Indonesia is facing an influx of Chinese workers. A long and occasionally violent history of anti-Chinese sentiment means these are contentious issues, especially in an election year. Social media is king in Indonesia and in the lead-up to the vote it has been awash with rumours over rising numbers of Chinese workers in the country. But what does the data show? We've taken a look into the figures behind China's growing role in Indonesia. Online rumours In January this year a video showing thousands of workers protesting at an industrial park in Morowali on the island of Sulawesi was widely shared on social media. The video claimed that these were Indonesian workers demonstrating against Chinese migrants who were earning higher salaries and taking local jobs. However, the manpower minister dismissed the claims, posting on Twitter that the protest in the video was about wages and not Chinese workers, and the police arrested a suspect accused of spreading false information. Other widely shared social media posts have shown images of Chinese tourists at airports with alarming captions claiming them to be illegal workers flooding into the country. And last month, a steel manufacturer in Java was forced to clarify how many Chinese nationals they employed after a video claiming to show foreign workers leaving the factory when viral. What is Prabowo saying? On the campaign trail Mr Prabowo hasn't directly referred to Chinese workers but has taken aim at the president's changes to foreign worker regulations, which aim to speed up the process of foreign worker applications to Indonesia. He has said \"we are not anti-foreigner but we need to take care of our own people, if we open our door to foreign workers, then what is left for us?\" Mr Prabowo has also suggested that Indonesia could learn from other countries. \"The United States wants to make a wall to keep them out. In Australia people who try to enter are sent to remote islands,\" he said during a speech ahead of the campaign. What does the data show? China is Indonesia's third largest source of foreign direct investment behind Singapore and Japan, according to the Indonesian government agency overseeing investment. These figures show Chinese firms have invested almost $10bn (£7.6bn) in Indonesia since 2014. Some of these big Chinese-backed projects have run into serious difficulties. A $6bn project to build high-speed train between Jakarta and the nearest city, Bandung, has been plagued by delays. In North Sumatra, environmentalists are fighting in the courts to stop a $1.6bn hydroelectric dam supported by the Bank of China that they say threatens to wipe out a critically endangered species of orangutan. While on the island of Borneo, a Chinese state-owned company is set to build hydropower plants worth almost $18bn. Indonesia hopes to attract $60bn in investment from China, but it is unlikely to get that much, says Fung Siu, an Asia specialist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. These Chinese-backed projects often seek to employ Chinese labour as a way to cut costs and increase efficiency. The most accurate way of measuring the number of registered foreign workers in Indonesia is to look at the number of permits issued. China receives the most foreign worker permits and the numbers are rising - doubling since 2013. But the total of just over 30,000 issued in 2018 is substantially less than the millions claimed by some. The World Bank estimates that overall, foreign workers made up a fraction, just 0.06%, of Indonesia's workforce in 2016, significantly less than Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. However, there may well be many more Chinese workers in Indonesia than the official tally of work permits suggests, although it's difficult to know how many. The Confederation of Indonesian Workers' Union (KSPI) claims low-skilled Chinese workers are coming in on tourist visas in their hundreds of thousands. The government also says Indonesian workers benefit from the training they receive from the highly skilled Chinese labour, who eventually return home leaving the local teams to take over. So, while the available data shows foreign workers from China and elsewhere make up a fraction of the total workforce in Indonesia, the issue remains a divisive and emotional one, easily stirred up during elections.

At the time, the US said if ZTE refused to comply, there would be consequences. This week, the US made good on those threats and is hitting ZTE where it hurts. A shortage of US components is likely to cause ZTE to miss shipment deadlines and lose orders, according to investment firm Jefferies. It has cut its estimates for ZTE sales by 13.5% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019. ZTE's chairman Yin Yimin has reportedly said this is a \"crisis\" and called for his 80,000 strong staff to remain calm, according to a leaked memo seen by the South China Morning Post. And it's not just the US. In a seemingly unrelated case, the UK on Monday warned companies about doing business with ZTE, saying its cyber-defence watchdog has blacklisted the Chinese firm over concerns of national security. Granted, these are two different issues, but the incidents highlight one glaring fact: the West is increasingly suspicious of Chinese tech. That suspicion is complicated by the current \"geopolitical tension\", says Chris DeAngelis of the ADG group in Beijing. Regardless of whether there is truth to the national security concerns, the real issue, he says, is that the US and the UK want to ensure the survival of globally competitive firms that compete with ZTE. The geopolitical tension Mr DeAngelis is referring to is the ongoing trade row between the US and China. At the heart of this spat, as I've said before, is that the US says China forced American companies that wanted access to low-cost labour and the massive market to tie up with Chinese companies - in effect allowing them to copy and steal American ideas. China says that's not true, and Beijing has been very vocal about the way it perceives its firms are being treated by the West. China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to \"create fair, just, and stable legal and policy environment for Chinese companies\", with regards to the ZTE decision. And perhaps more notably, it also said it was prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms. ZTE is not the only Chinese tech firm that's been targeted by the West. China's Huawei, for example, has been blocked from striking a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier over security concerns. And Broadcom, a firm formerly domiciled in Singapore, had its bid to takeover Qualcomm blocked because of US national security concerns that specifically cited Huawei and Chinese technology. At the crux of this is a suspicion that Chinese companies are the eyes and ears of the Chinese government in Western markets. Whether those suspicions are warranted is hard to prove, but \"there is no question that telecom and communications is a valid security risk\", Mr DeAngelis told me. \"If you have a problem in a network, do you really want to rely on your vendor if you are in the middle of a trade war, for example?\" he said. Most of the narrative on Chinese tech is that they've copied American ideas and then sold them back to the West at cheaper prices. While that may have been true in the past, it's certainly not fair to say that today. My experience of reporting on Chinese tech over the last few years has shown me that Chinese companies are innovating at a pace that is often unparalleled by other countries. Recently, Chinese firms have also beaten global firms in China, as ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing proved recently by driving Uber out. Some say the West's fear originates in envy and an ignorance of just how hard Chinese firms can make their staff work. \"Unless people have seen the Chinese tech culture known as 996, they don't understand Chinese tech,\" writes Lawrence Kuok in supchina.com. (The number 996 refers to the Chinese tech firms' practice of working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week.) \"What I think a lot of people don't understand about the Chinese market is that there are many aspects that require pure and utter hard work,\" he said. Chinese tech firms do get help from their government, in the form of protection of the domestic market, which has allowed them to grow and dominate in China. That's not to say they're not formidable players in their own right, though. But China, and Chinese firms, are used to having a longer term view. \"No road that leads to a bright future is straight,\" says ZTE's Mr Yin in that leaked memo. \"The company's internationalisation will also have its ups and downs… we will be stronger after weathering the storm.\"", "summary": "美国和英国双双向中国电信巨头中兴通讯（ZTE)发出警告，令中兴通讯雪上加霜。"}

The US is pursuing criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ren spoke to the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in his first international broadcast interview since Ms Meng was arrested - and dismissed the pressure from the US. \"There's no way the US can crush us,\" he said. \"The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit.\" However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact. What else did Mr Ren say about the US? Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the country's allies against using Huawei technology, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to \"partner alongside them\". Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned or blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for their future 5G mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Mr Ren warned that \"the world cannot leave us because we are more advanced\". \"If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world.\" What did Mr Ren say about investment in the UK? The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has decided that any risk posed by using Huawei technology in UK telecoms projects can be managed. Many of the UK's mobile companies, including Vodafone, EE and Three, are working with Huawei to develop their 5G networks. They are awaiting a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. Commenting on the possibility of a UK ban, Mr Ren said Huawei \"won't withdraw our investment because of this. We will continue to invest in the UK. \"We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. \"We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale.\" What does Mr Ren think about his daughter's arrest? Mr Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested on 1 December in Vancouver at the request of the US, and is expected to be the subject of a formal extradition request. In total, 23 charges are levelled against Huawei and Ms Weng. The charges are split across two indictments by the US Department of Justice. The first covers claims Huawei hid business links to Iran - which is subject to US trade sanctions. The second includes the charge of attempted theft of trade secrets. Mr Ren was clear in his opposition to the US accusations. \"Firstly, I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. \"The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such combative methods. \"We object to this. But now that we've gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it.\" What did Mr Ren say about Chinese government spying? Huawei, which is China's largest private company, has been under scrutiny for its links to the Chinese government - with the US and others expressing concern its technology could be used by China's security services to spy. Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to \"support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\". But Mr Ren said that allowing spying was a risk he wouldn't take. \"The Chinese government has already clearly said that it won't install any backdoors. And we won't install backdoors either. \"We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world, because of something like this. \"Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down.\" Is Huawei part of the Chinese state? Analysis - Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent - Shenzhen For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny from Western governments. Mr Ren is right: the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all of my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was \"OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be\". He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, but he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law.

He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack 'I played dead' Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. \"We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. \"You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. \"So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. \"The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. \"You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. \"Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. \"And then click again. He put more bullets in. \"And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again.\" Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Shot Welshman 'was human shield' Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: \"He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. \"He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away.\" 'We just ran' Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: \"I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. \"I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran.\" The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to \"not let them stop me.\" 'Frightened? It's unbelievable!' Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. \"We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive,\" she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. \"Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really,\" said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme 'I hid in hotel laundry' One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. \"Then there were big explosions and then gunshots,\" he said. \"You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife.\" 'We thought it was the end' Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: \"We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other.\" \"We thought it was the end,\" Mr Barlow added. Staff 'prepared to take bullets' Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. \"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough,\" he said. 'I kissed my wife goodbye' One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story 'They're inside - run' A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was \"killed about 400 yards\" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw \"hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach,\" before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. 'Everyone was running' Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. \"It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. \"We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on,\" said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. 'Run, there's a gun' Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. 'We feared for our lives' Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. \"We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. \"I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. \"We just wanted to get safe somewhere. \"There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. \"We just feared for our lives.\" Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton 'Pandemonium' Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire. The couple were staying at a hotel about 300 yards from where the shooting happened. Mr McKenzie said \"pandemonium\" broke out. \"Everyone was running. I hadn't heard any gunfire,\" he said. \"If they had come to our section of the beach, we'd have been wiped out because we always lay right at the front of the beach... and wouldn't have had a chance, quite honestly. \"By the grace of God, it didn't happen to us.\"", "summary": "BBC获悉，突尼斯度假胜地苏塞海滨枪击案38名死难者中至少30人是英国人。"}

The gay rights protests were organised in 19 cities around the globe. The Olympic torch has arrived in Sochi, having visited 135 cities in the 122 days since leaving Moscow. It will spend three days in and around Sochi before arriving in the Olympic stadium to light the Olympic cauldron during Friday's opening ceremony. Growing disquiet Wednesday's protests took place in cities including Melbourne, London, Paris and St Petersburg, with more expected during the evening. Activists want Olympic sponsors such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Samsung and Visa to speak against Russia's new laws on homosexuality. Last year, Russia banned the promotion of \"non-traditional\" sexuality - widely seen as an attack on gay rights. The law makes providing information on homosexuality to under-18s a crime, punishable by a fine. Critics say its loose interpretation effectively stops gay rights protests in Russia. Marie Campbell, a director at the equality campaign group All Out, told the BBC that the new Russian laws went against the spirit of the Olympics. \"All our members, as well as everyone else around the world, want to celebrate the Olympic values of personal strength and endurance and integrity,\" she said. \"All we are saying is that we can't just ignore the fact that this is happening in Russia where these anti-gay laws are preventing the Olympic values being lived and enjoyed by millions of people.\" In a corporate blog post, AT&T condemned Russia's stance, saying it stood \"against Russia's anti-LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] law\". The telecommunications giant is not an IOC sponsor but it does sponsor the US Olympic Committee. Last month, President Vladimir Putin said homosexuals would be welcome in Sochi for the Olympics but added: \"Just leave the children in peace.\" \"We don't have a ban on non-traditional sexual relations,\" he said. \"We have a ban on the propaganda of homosexuality and paedophilia.\" Unfinished hotels Meanwhile, President Putin has arrived in Sochi amid growing disquiet about whether preparations will be complete by Friday. Hundreds of visitors arriving this week found that their hotels were unfinished. The BBC's Daniel Sandford in Sochi says that while the venues themselves appear complete, the areas around them still resemble building sites. Our correspondent says that what President Putin had hoped would be a showcase event is still proving to be a headache. The estimated cost of the Games has soared from $12bn (£7bn) to over $50bn. The ratings agency Moody's released a report on Wednesday suggesting Russia was unlikely to receive an overall macroeconomic boost from the event - something which, correspondents say, President Putin had banked on. It said Sochi and the surrounding area would struggle to maintain Olympic facilities after the event, and it was unclear whether they would receive the hoped-for boost in tourism revenues. Addressing journalists in Sochi on Tuesday, Mr Putin insisted that the enormous construction effort to prepare the city for the games had greatly improved the environment.

China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei all have conflicting claims over reefs and islands in the sea. China turned Fiery Cross Reef into an artificial island through a massive dredging operation, constructing buildings and an airstrip. China says the structures are for civilian purposes.

US Defense Department spokesman Bill Urban said Tuesday's naval operation was designed to \"challenge excessive maritime claims of some claimants in the South China Sea\".

The judges sitting at the Eastern High Court also said there were \"aggravating circumstances\" because the crime was \"meticulously planned\".

Intelligence chief Vasyl Hrytsak said the man had planned 15 attacks and was driven by ultra-nationalist views. He had amassed guns, detonators and 125kg of TNT, Mr Hrytsak said. Mr Hrytsak listed bridges, motorways, a mosque and a synagogue among the suspect's potential targets. He was being prosecuted for arms smuggling and terrorism, he said. It was not clear if the tournament itself was being targeted and Paris police prefect Michel Cadot told reporters there was \"no specific threat against any [Euro 2016] site\". 'Threat exists' News of the man's arrest on 21 May first emerged in a report by French TV network M6. The suspect was described as a worker at a farming co-operative from the Lorraine area of eastern France. He had no previous criminal record, reports said. French authorities have been on high security alert ahead of the European championships, amid fears that the tournament could be targeted by Islamist militants. President Francois Hollande said on Sunday that \"the threat exists\" but that France should not be daunted. Analysis - by BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield The French police and judicial authorities are saying very little about Gregoire Moutaux. They clearly want to know more from the Ukrainians before they pronounce on any possible terrorist link. What's significant is that so far the French investigation is not in the hands of anti-terrorist specialists, but of the unit that looks into organised crime. This would suggest that the initial suspicion in Paris is that Mr Moutaux was engaged in arms trafficking. His home in north-east France has been searched by police, who - according to media reports - found a T-shirt bearing far-right insignia. The Ukrainians say he was motivated by hatred of immigration and globalisation. Ukraine's SBU security service said it had been watching the suspect since December last year and that he had picked up five Kalashnikovs, two anti-tank grenade launchers, some 5,000 rounds of ammunition and 100 detonators, as well as a large quantity of explosives. An SBU video was shown of the dramatic moment of the suspect's arrest along with the weapons that intelligence officials said they had found. The arrest was said to have taken place at a border crossing close to the Ukrainian town of Yahodyn. The footage also revealed a second person being wrestled to the ground on the passenger side of the car. The SBU chief said the French suspect had been in touch \"with military units fighting in Donbass\", a reference to the eastern areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, where pro-Russian rebels have seized large areas of Ukrainian territory. \"The Frenchman spoke negatively of the activities of his government on mass migration of foreigners to France, the spread of Islam and globalisation. He also said he wished to stage a number of terrorist attacks in protest,\" Mr Hrytsak said. Euro 2016 security France's 10 Euro 2016 stadiums Euro 2016 - Uefa website A search was carried out at the suspect's home in the tiny village of Nant-le-Petit and police sources told French media that explosive material and balaclavas were recovered. An inquiry has been launched by France's organised crime agency, OCLCO, and by regional authorities in Nancy. However, French police sources told AFP news agency that Ukrainian officials had yet to send them any details. There was some scepticism that the suspect could have been anything more than an arms trafficker. Residents in Nant-le-Petit were stunned by the arrest of Gregoire Moutaux, who lives there with his grandfather and works as a cattle inseminator. \"He's a rather nice guy, who I think is actually rather well-educated. I've even invited him over for a glass of wine. I just can't understand this,\" neighbour Jean-Jacques Renck told France 3 TV. Anti-terrorism specialist Alain Bauer said Ukraine had become a big source of arms because of the continuing conflict in the east of the country. The man detained did not fit the usual profile of an attacker, he said, pointing to the arrest last year of far-right activist Claude Hermant, accused of providing weapons to a jihadist who murdered four people at a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January 2015.", "summary": "乌克兰安全局表示，该机构上个月逮捕的一名法国人计划在2016欧洲杯足球赛期间发动攻击。"}

But regional police chief Elmer Soria said he was told by the provincial governor of Leyte that there were about 10,000 deaths on the eastern island alone. Darren White, a British tourist who experienced the typhoon in Cebu province in the Philippines, said the situation for survivors was deteriorating, largely due to a lack of access to food and clean water. \"There was rotting vegetation on the streets, stagnant water, flies were starting to come so disease would have been coming up as well,\" he said. The storm made landfall shortly before dawn on Friday, bringing gusts that reached 379km/h (235 mph), according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center, with waves as high as 15m (45ft), bringing up to 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain in places. With the typhoon now bearing down on Vietnam, another team of UK experts has also been put on standby to travel there. More than 100,000 Britons visit Vietnam every year, with many visiting the northern city of Hanoi, the capital, and the popular tourist destination of Halong Bay in the north east of Vietnam, both of which are expected to be in the path of the typhoon. Tourist David Riley said: \"I am quite frightened because we don't have anything like this in England. \"We've spoken to a few locals and they've calmed us down a little bit and said we'll be alright as long as we stay indoors.\" David Riley, who is also in Vietnam, said: \"All we are going to be doing is to get in the hotel, just making sure we stay in there, get a lot of food and water just in case it does hit badly. \"But hopefully, all being well, it won't hit as badly as it has in the Philippines.\" The Foreign Office is advising travellers to follow advice from local authorities and has teams on standby in Hue and Da Nang to assist any British nationals. Current projections suggest it could move northwards along the coast from Sunday afternoon local time before making landfall south of Hanoi - although it is expected to decrease in power as it reaches land. Authorities there have begun the mass evacuation of more than 200,000 people.", "summary": "英国承诺拨600万英镑救援款为至多50万名菲律宾风灾灾民提供救助。"}

The 19th amendment is considered to be a seminal piece of legislation, but for minority women - particularly African-American, Hispanic and Native-American women - there was a long road ahead to ensure complete access to the vote. To mark this year's centennial, the BBC spoke to a number of women running for office - both Republican and Democrat - to see what has been achieved and what is left to do. 'Little by little, those glass ceilings are coming down' Jennifer Carroll Foy, Gubernatorial Candidate for Virginia (Democrat) \"It's poetic that we have such a consequential presidential election in the 100th year that women have been able to vote,\" Jennifer Carroll Foy said. A native of Petersburg, Virginia, she was raised by her grandmother - whose trademark adage was, \"if you have it, you have to give it.\" It is a truth that Ms Carroll Foy seeks to employ in her politics. While she is excited about celebrating the centennial of the 19th amendment, she is acutely aware that the amendment wasn't wholly inclusive. Black and brown women faced an arduous journey to achieve equal voting access - that wasn't conferred until the Voting Rights Act in 1965. \"As a black woman there is still work to be done,\" she said. \"Until all women have full and unfettered rights to vote, the fight for women's right to vote continues.\" For Ms Caroll Foy, on the centennial of the 19th amendment, it's even more important to have a woman of colour on the ballot. \"When you don't see women in power, it's hard to fathom that being a possibility,\" she said. \"It's not lost on me that I would be the first black woman governor in our country.\" Similarly, on this anniversary, Senator Kamala Harris' spot on the Democratic ticket is particularly auspicious for Ms Carrol Foy, as it paves the way for black and brown girls everywhere to \"see themselves in her\". 'I don't know how many men get called 'honey' at a council meeting' Beth Van Duyne, Candidate for the US House of Representatives in Texas, District 24 (Republican) \"I think about how far we have come,\" Beth Van Duyne said. \"It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year.\" According to Ms Van Duyne, the 19th amendment's ratification has heralded decades of advancements for women. From the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, to the number of women enrolled in higher education, by way of new businesses founded by women. \"It's very gratifying to see that women are empowered, are supported, and are achieving success in greater numbers,\" she said. But Ms Van Duyne's 16-year career in politics has been chequered by misogyny at various points. As the first female mayor of Irving, Texas, she remembers having to overcome an \"old boy network\" of all-male city council members. \"I approached it from the outside in,\" she recalled. \"I don't know how many men get called 'honey' at a council meeting.\" Moving forward, Ms Van Duyne is encouraged by the swathes of women entering politics. \"As you get a more reflective body, you'll see less division,\" she added. 'I still think we have a long way to go to make everyone able to vote' Julie Oliver, Candidate for US House of Representatives in Texas, District 25 (Democrat) As a child, raised in a low-income household by a single parent, Julie Oliver wasn't sure how her mother put food on the table. \"I had no idea how she did it, but she did it,\" Ms Oliver said. Her mother's tenacity inspired Ms Oliver's own run for Congress. This is her second run for District 25 in Texas, which encompasses Austin and Central Texas. \"I always say, 'can you imagine what Congress would look like coming from the heart of a mother?'\" she told BBC News. When she initially ran for Congress in 2018, she joked that her husband should have talked her out of the idea. Instead, she recalls how he encouraged her to run. \"I'm grateful for the enlightened men in my life,\" she added. As a woman in politics, Ms Oliver believes that greater representation in the House would lead to a more collaborative policy approach across party lines. \"Women have similar goals when it comes to education, access to healthcare and investing in infrastructure.\" Although the anniversary of the 19th amendment is cause for celebration for giving \"a certain group of women the right to vote,\" Ms Oliver feels that the centennial is an opportunity to reflect on the work remaining to enfranchise minority women across the country. \"It includes all women, not just white women,\" she said. Ensuring that black and brown voices are empowered is integral to Ms Oliver's run for office. \"But I hope people call me out when I'm not doing enough,\" she said. \"I want to be held accountable.\" 'As a working mother, how do I look after my people?' Valerie Ramirez Mukherjee, Candidate for US House of Representatives in Illinois, District 10 (Republican) Throughout her career in business and finance, Valerie Ramirez Mukherjee said that she was lucky to not experience gender discrimination, but would often hear from women who did. \"I want to help solve this,\" she said. \"How do we get others to experience what I've experienced?\" Ms Ramirez Mukherjee and her brother were the first in their family to attend university, and she recalls that their mother didn't raise them to see any difference between genders. \"I didn't see that there was a 'role' of a girl or a boy,\" she said. \"It was about who had the skill or the interest to get the job done.\" It was when Ms Ramirez Mukherjee wanted to start a family, that she was made to feel aware of her gender. Her two pregnancies were difficult, and she realised that trying to find time for necessary doctor's appointments during the work day would unsettle her male colleagues. Now, in her first run for public office, Ms Ramirez Mukherjee is focused on creating transparency for women in the workplace. \"100 years later and we're still having this conversation,\" she said. \"If a woman decides to start a family, how do we talk about that more?\" When it comes to the state of voting access in the US, Ms Ramirez Mukherjee is \"grateful\" that the mail-in ballot has become a widely discussed option this year. She believes that this will empower more people, particularly women, to vote. \"Not everyone has the privilege to go down to the polling station,\" she said.", "summary": "今年是美国宪法第19修正案颁布的100周年，该法案保证了美国女性有投票的权利。"}

The mosquitoes are infected with a bug called Wolbachia which reduces their ability to spread viruses to people. The $18m dollar project is funded by an international team of donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \"Vaccinating mosquitoes\" The scheme - which aims to start in early 2017 - is also financed by local governments in Latin America, the US and the UK. Wolbachia is a naturally occurring bacterium that infects 60% of insect species worldwide, but scientists say it does not harm humans. The bug does not usually infect the Aedes aegypti mosquito - the species mostly responsible for spreading a host of diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and cikungunya. But over the last decade researchers working for the Eliminate Dengue Program have found a way to inject the bug into Aedes mosquitoes. And researchers say small-scale observational trials in Brazil, Colombia, Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam have shown that once released, the modified mosquitoes can cut the spread of dengue to humans. It has been shown to do the same for Zika and chikungunya in laboratory-based tests. Dr Trevor Mundel, of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said: \"Wolbachia could be a revolutionary protection against mosquito-borne disease. \"It's affordable, sustainable, and appears to provide protection against Zika, dengue and a host of other viruses. \"We are eager to study its impact and how it can help countries.\" Researchers now plan to expand the trials to large urban areas in Bello in Colombia, other parts of Antioquia, and the greater Rio de Janeiro area in partnership with local governments. Scientists say once released, the infected mosquitoes breed with uninfected ones, passing on the bug to future generations. They will monitor the programme closely for the next three years, checking to see if cases of dengue fever, Zika and chikungunya fall. Prof Scott O'Neill, of the Eliminate Dengue Program, told the BBC: \"In the communities we have already worked with there have initially been two concerns. \"One was that the mosquitoes might harm them in some way or that there might be some unintended consequences. \"It is testament to our community engagement teams working really closely with communities to answer questions that all the communities we work with are fully supportive. \"We explained Wolbachia bugs are present in so many insects worldwide that millions of humans come into contact with them everyday with no problems. \"And in the six years we have been doing these trials there have been no problems.\" 'Resource competition' Researchers say it is likely that the Wolbachia approach works in two ways. According to Prof O'Neill, Wolbachia appears to boost the immune system of mosquitoes, making them resistant to viruses like dengue. And Wolbachia may compete with dengue and Zika for resources essential to replication. The viruses lose out and do not replicate as successfully, making it harder for them to be passed on when a mosquito bites a human.", "summary": "科学家将派出一支特种部队空降到巴西和哥伦比亚部分地区，地面目标是寨卡（Zika）病毒、基孔肯亚病（chikungunya）等流行疾病。这支突击队由数百万经过改良的蚊子组成。"}

The giraffe has a rare genetic condition called leucism, which causes the loss of skin pigmentation. He is thought to be the last of his kind, after poachers killed two of his family members in March. Rangers fear the giraffe could suffer the same fate as his relatives, a female and her seven-month-old calf with similar white skin. Their carcasses were found in a conservation area in Kenya's north-eastern Garissa County, where the male giraffe is currently living alone. The Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, which oversees wildlife in the area, said the tracking device was attached to one of the giraffe's horns on 8 November. In a statement released on Tuesday, the non-profit group said the tracking device would give hourly updates on the giraffe's whereabouts, enabling rangers to \"keep the unique animal safe from poachers\". The manager of the group, Mohammed Ahmednoor, thanked conservationists for their help in protecting the giraffe and other wildlife. \"The giraffe's grazing range has been blessed with good rains in the recent past and the abundant vegetation bodes well for the future of the white male,\" he said. The Kenya Wildlife Society, the main conservation body in the east-African country, said it was happy to assist in efforts to protect \"unique wildlife like the only known white giraffe\". White giraffes were first spotted in Kenya in March 2016, about two months after a sighting in neighbouring Tanzania. A year later, white giraffes made headlines again, after the mother and her calf from the conservancy in Kenya's Garissa County were caught on camera. Native to more than 15 African countries, giraffes are the world's tallest mammals. They are hunted by poachers for their hides, meat and body parts. Some 40% of the giraffe population has disappeared in the last 30 years, with poaching and wildlife trafficking contributing to this decline, according to the Africa Wildlife Foundation (AWF). Giraffes have been designated as a vulnerable species on The International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List, with an estimated population of 68,293 globally.

When he's not dad-dancing in Verbier or spending time with his young family, the Duke of Cambridge splits his time between royal duties, a part-time job as a pilot and his charitable work. So far this year, the 34-year-old has attended royal engagements on 12 days, including a trip to south Wales, a gala dinner and an investiture at Buckingham Palace. The record of these attendances is detailed in the Court Circular, which was last updated on 10 March and does not specify the hours of each event. Nor does it take into account behind-the-scenes activity or preparation for royal events. Since 2015, the prince has worked as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service. There, he works 9.5 hour shifts, clocking up an average of 20 hours per week - the salary for which is donated to charity. Based on these hours and the royal engagements, Prince William will have worked the equivalent of 34 of the possible 53 working days in 2017 so far. Earlier this year he announced he would be leaving his ambulance job in the summer to take on more royal duties. By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is not unfamiliar terrain for Prince William or indeed for his family. To be found wanting in the eyes of the tabloids is an occupational hazard that has dogged them for decades. When the prince decided to ski with his mates rather than leave early and attend a church service that mattered to his grandmother, he could have predicted that he would be judged to have made an error of judgement. It was an error that he can regret at leisure. But what he couldn't necessarily have predicted was that he would have remained headline news for so long. The future king is wary of the media. The newspapers are increasingly concerned at his attempts to bypass them and use social media instead. The next test will come in the autumn when he becomes a full-time senior royal. If by then there isn't a noticeable increase in his royal workload, there's a risk the tabloids will once again sit in judgement and once again find Prince William wanting. Read more from Peter Hunt In 2016, Prince William clocked up 80 days of royal engagements - well behind the busiest member of the royal family, Princess Anne, with 179 days of engagements. Prince Charles, 68, came second with 139 and the Queen, 90, matched her grandson with 80 days. Prince William's job: What's it like being an air ambulance pilot? Prince William: 'We must do more on illegal ivory trade' Despite denouncing the work-shy claims as \"absolute rubbish\" and \"grossly unfair\", royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said the headlines were \"irresistible\" for the tabloid press. \"It's an unfair perception that the photographs reinforce,\" he said. Prince William has said criticism of being work-shy was not something he ignored, but not something he \"took completely to heart\" either. Prince William is patron or president to 23 organisations, including the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Not all the work he does to fulfil these roles is classed as a royal engagement. Centrepoint - the youth homelessness charity of which the Prince has been a patron since 2005 - said the royal visits hostels publicly and privately, volunteering alongside staff and regularly meeting with the Centrepoint parliament. Chief executive Seyi Obakin, said: \"Within the last three months, he has publicly and actively supported our plans to create a national helpline for homeless young people. \"Last month, he launched with us the Centrepoint helpline.\" Prince William has also campaigned vigorously against animal poaching. At an international conference in November he called on the UK government to pass a total ban on the domestic ivory trade.

The company also forecast higher-than-expected holiday season revenue of between $76bn and $78bn. But revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9% to $46.85bn. That meant annual revenue fell for the first time since 2001, highlighting a slowdown in the smartphone market as well as intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC Technology correspondent It was no surprise that Apple saw its first fall in annual revenues for 15 years. It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying. But somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply. And crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares. But the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say \"we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had\". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time. Apple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets. Revenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter. In the same period last year, revenue from Greater China doubled. Apple's shares were down 3% at about $114.80 in after-hours trading. \"Apple didn't have a great [fourth quarter] as iPhones, Macs, China, the US and what appears to be Watch were down,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Net income fell to $9.01bn in the fourth quarter, down from $11bn in the same quarter last year. For the year, net income fell to $45.7bn from $53.4bn.

This could force the first so-called supersymmetric particle to appear in the machine, with the most likely candidate being the gluino. Its detection would give scientists direct pointers to \"dark matter\". And that would be a big opening into some of the remaining mysteries of the universe. \"It could be as early as this year. Summer may be a bit hard but late summer maybe, if we're really lucky,\" said Prof Beate Heinemann, who is a spokeswoman for the Atlas experiment, one of the big particle detectors at the LHC. \"We hope that we're just now at this threshold that we're finding another world, like antimatter for instance. We found antimatter in the beginning of the last century. Maybe we'll find now supersymmetric matter.\" The University of California at Berkeley researcher made her comments at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In the debris Supersymmetry is an addition to the Standard Model, which describes nature’s fundamental particles and their interactions. Susy, as it is sometimes known, fills some gaps in the model and provides a basis to unify nature's forces. It predicts each of the particles to have more massive partners. So the particle that carries light – the photon – would have a partner called the photino. The quark, the building block of an atom’s protons and neutrons, would have a partner called the squark. But when the LHC was colliding matter at its pre-upgrade energies, no sign of these superparticles was seen in the debris, which led to some consternation among theorists. Now, with the accelerator about to reopen in the coming weeks, there is high hope the first evidence of Susy can be found. The machine is going to double the collision energy, taking it into a domain where those theorists say the gluino really ought to emerge in sufficient numbers to be noticed. The gluino is the superpartner of the gluon, which \"glues\" the quarks together inside protons and neutrons. The LHC’s detectors would not see it directly. What they would track is its decay, which scientists would then have to reconstruct. But importantly, those decay products should include the lightest and most stable superparticle, known as the neutralino – the particle that researchers have proposed is what makes up dark matter, the missing mass in the cosmos that gravitationally binds galaxies together on the sky but which cannot be seen directly with telescopes. \"This would rock the world,” said Prof Heinemann. \"For me, it’s more exciting than the Higgs.\" 'The other side' So, not only would supersymmetry proponents be elated because they would have their first superparticle, but science in general would have a firm foot on the road to understanding dark matter. Dr Michael Williams, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \"We sometimes talk about the dark matter particle, but it’s perfectly plausible that dark matter is just as interesting as [normal] matter, [which] has a lot of particles that we know about. \"There might be just as many dark matter particles, or even more. \"Finding any particle that could be a dark matter candidate is nice because we could start to understand how it affects the galaxy and the evolution of the universe, but it also opens the door to whatever is on the other side, which we have no idea what is there.\" Particle physicists have three major conferences in August and September, one of which is the main gathering of the supersymmetry community. All these meetings are bound to draw huge interest. But Prof Jay Hauser, who works on the CMS detector at the LHC, added a little caution on timings. \"Even if we did see something, remember it might be complicated enough that it takes us a while to explain it,\" he told reporters.

Last year the number of babies born in Japan fell below 865,000 - a record low. The fast-greying nation has long been searching for ways to reverse one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Boosting the use of AI tech is one of its latest efforts. Next year the government plans to allocate local authorities 2bn yen ($19m, £14m) to boost the birth rate, reported AFP news agency. Many already offer human-run matchmaking services and some have introduced AI systems in the hope they will perform a more sophisticated analysis of the standardised forms where people submit their details. A few of the existing systems are limited to considering criteria such as income and age, only producing a result if there is an exact match. Local media say that the funding aims to allow authorities to harness more costly advanced systems that take into account factors like hobbies and values. \"We are especially planning to offer subsidies to local governments operating or starting up matchmaking projects that use AI,\" a cabinet official told AFP. \"We hope this support will help reverse the decline in the nation's birthrate.\" Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Policymakers are racing to ensure the country's contracting workforce can meet the expanding costs of welfare. Sachiko Horiguchi, a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist at Japan's Temple University, thinks there are better ways for the government to bump up the birth rate than subsidising AI matchmaking - such as helping young people earning low wages. She pointed to a recent report which suggests a link between lower income levels and the loss of interest in romantic relationships among young Japanese adults. \"If they're not interested in dating, the matchmaking would likely be ineffective,\" Dr Horiguchi told the BBC. \"If we are to rely on technologies, affordable AI robots taking over household or childcare tasks may be more effective.\" Analysts have long pointed towards the lack of support for working mothers in Japan, where there are strong expectations women will do all the housework and raise children alongside doing their jobs. The government has said it wants to encourage more women into full-time employment in recent years but the gender gap has grown.

It is unclear if migrants accessed UK-bound vehicles, they said. It comes as French police figures suggested 70% of migrants processed in Calais leave within four months. \"They cannot ascertain whether these migrants leave to go elsewhere in France, or whether they enter the UK,\" Kent Police Chief Constable Alan Pughsley told the UK Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee. The prime minister's official spokeswoman stressed there was \"no evidence\" all of those leaving Calais were reaching the UK. \"Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that some will be seeking opportunities elsewhere in France or elsewhere in Europe,\" she added. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will later chair a meeting of the government's Cobra contingencies committee to discuss the latest on the crisis. Travel delays Eurotunnel passenger services are currently disrupted, with trains leaving later than planned, and some DFDS ferry sailings are also delayed. It is estimated there are 3,000 migrants in the Calais area, and many are continuing their attempts to reach the UK by crossing the Channel. There have been thousands of attempts to access the Eurotunnel terminal in recent weeks. Nine people have died trying to access the tunnel since the start of June. Some attempt to stow away on lorries headed for the Eurotunnel, or climb or cut security fences to try to hide on Eurotunnel shuttles. The French police union said 1,000 people were pushed back by a line of riot police on Sunday night. Some 700 were physically removed from the freight terminal or restrained, they said. One man was arrested and a police officer was left with minor facial injuries after being hit by a rock. The figures do not necessarily mean 1,700 people tried to make it into the Channel Tunnel, the BBC's Gavin Lee said, as some may have made more than one attempt during the course of the night. The number of intrusions was the highest since last Monday night, according to the figures, which also revealed: No figures for Saturday night were released. At the scene: BBC News correspondent Gavin Lee The word amongst the migrants in the so called \"Jungle\" camp is that Monday night will be the biggest attempt so far to break into the Channel Tunnel freight terminal. Whether it's rumour or reality, French riot police are already preparing for another big test of their security operation, with officers stationed at potentially vulnerable spots along the terminal's 10 mile perimeter. Meanwhile, the dynamic has changed at the Jungle, six miles away from the terminal. Some of the estimated 3,000 migrants who've been living rough in makeshift tents have abandoned the camp and are now sleeping in fields closer to the train terminal in Coquelles, presenting a new problem for police trying to monitor increasingly separate groups. Measures have been brought in to try to tackle the situation in Calais, including police reinforcements, new fencing and surveillance, and a safe zone for UK-bound lorries. Prime Minister David Cameron has warned illegal immigrants who reach Britain will be deported. On Monday, it was announced landlords in England would be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to remain in the UK, under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration. The director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, John Keefe, said measures to discourage people from coming to Britain in the first place may work in the long term, but wouldn't solve the situation in Calais. He said the \"major problem\" was the thousands of migrants living and moving around the Calais area \"at will\". \"And until the government can do something about removing that group of people and stopping the flow directly to Calais, we're going to remain in this situation,\" he said.

It adds that six in 10 schools are not \"realising the subject's full potential\" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century. The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising. The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE. Fundamental questions In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject. The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had \"suffered\" because of government changes. He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected. Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject \"plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society\" but it finds \"many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding\". It adds: \"Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief.\" Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012. They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010. 'Weak' understanding Teaching in primary schools was \"not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject\", they found. Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often \"failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion.\" The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government. They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to \"clarify the aims and purposes of RE\" and to improve teacher training. Schools should ensure that teaching deepens \"pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world,\" they urge. John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning \"for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools\". He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October. \"It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this.\" Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough. \"With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising. \"Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views.\" Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject. She said: \"Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects. \"So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.\" \"Unfortunately\", she added, \"I think RE has fallen off the radar\".", "summary": "英国教育监察机构表示，英格兰地区一半以上的学校没有能够为学生提供良好的宗教教育课。"}

He was being held by Islamic State militants who have already killed two US captives. The latest video also includes a threat to kill a second British hostage. The PM vowed to do everything possible to find the killers. Mr Haines's family said he would be \"missed terribly\". Born in Holderness, East Yorkshire, Mr Haines went to school in Perth and had been living in Croatia with his second wife, who is Croatian, and their four-year-old daughter. His parents live in Ayr. 'Despicable and appalling' In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Mike Haines said his brother, a father of two, \"was and is loved by all his family\". \"David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,\" he said. Mr Cameron, who chaired an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Sunday morning, said the murder of an innocent aid worker was \"despicable and appalling\". \"It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal. \"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,\" the prime minister added. 'Grief and resolve' The Foreign Office is working to verify the video, which was released on Saturday night. It begins with a clip of Mr Cameron and then features a man who appears to be Mr Haines dressed in orange overalls, kneeling in front of a masked man holding a knife. The victim says: \"My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution.\" He says Mr Cameron had entered into a coalition with the US against the Islamic State \"just as your predecessor Tony Blair did\". \"Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our parliament's selfish decisions,\" he said. The militant, who appears to have a British accent, is then recorded as saying: \"This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State.\" Islamic State is now in control of large parts of northern Iraq and Syria, and the CIA estimates that the group could have as many as 30,000 fighters in the region. The UK has donated heavy machine guns and ammunition to authorities in Iraq to help fight IS militants, the Ministry of Defence has previously said. Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have been involved in heavy fighting with IS. International condemnation Mr Haines's death has been condemned by international political leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, French President Francois Hollande, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. US President Barack Obama said the US would work with the UK and other countries to \"bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice\". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government \"will not rest\" until Mr Haines's killers \"face justice\". Mr Alex Salmond said a resilience meeting - the Scottish government's version of the UK's Cobra security meeting - would be held on Sunday morning to discuss issues such as the privacy of Mr Haines's family. The leader of the Better Together campaign in Scotland, Alistair Darling, said Mr Haines's death \"inexcusable, a barbaric act\" that would \"strengthen the resolve of the international community\". Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would like to see the militant in the video \"face justice in a British court - he's a British citizen and has been boasting of that\". Analysis: Jim Muir, BBC News The beheadings of David Haines, and the two American journalists before him, are believed to have been filmed in the desert near Raqqa, a provincial capital in north-east Syria which has become the unofficial capital of the self-styled Islamic State. Far from being just a shadowy terror group, IS controls a large swathe of territory in the north and east of Syria, linked since June to almost all the mainly Sunni parts of Iraq. It controls a population of around 5 or 6 million people, including Iraq's second city, Mosul. In northern Iraq, the Kurds, helped by US air strikes, are slowly regaining the ground they lost to IS when it suddenly turned on them last month. That's the template the Americans and their allies want to apply to other parts of Iraq, and Syria, but the situation in both countries is complicated by the absence of clear-cut, cohesive local forces on the ground to work with. Elsewhere, religious leaders have also reacted to the killing, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who posted a call on Twitter for prayers for the family of Mr Haines, who was \"evilly killed\". Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain said: \"These extremists wish to draw attention and recruits to their cause by sowing division and fear between people here in Britain. Let us deny them that luxury.\" 'Criminals and villains' Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said it was vital that Britain took some \"serious action\" against IS. \"The key issue here is that we cannot rule out the use of large-scale ground forces. I don't mean the kind of thing that's happening now. I mean large-scale intervention forces,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. Failure to do so would mean Britain would \"just accept the fact that the Islamic State will continue to expand, continue to decapitate our citizens, continue to pose a threat to our country and countries in the region\". But former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge said Britain \"must be sober about this, and understand our national interests and equate what we do with those interests\". He said IS's objective now is \"to hold what it's got, and there's no better way of doing that than recruiting to it the millions of people in the area who'd be quite happy to fight yet another Western intervention in the area\". Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University, said the UK's natural reaction would be to \"go in hard\" against IS, but that this presented a problem, because the extremists wanted to be attacked so as to \"present itself as fighting the far enemy\". Mr Rogers also said the \"war\" in the region was \"at a much higher level than we suppose\", with more than 2,000 sorties by the US in the last few weeks. The West was now moving into \"what is essentially a third Iraq war\" and that this time it would extend into Syria, he said. Mr Haines was taken hostage in the village of Atmeh, in the Idlib province of Syria, in March 2013. He had been helping French agency Acted deliver humanitarian aid, having previously helped local people in Libya and South Sudan. The release of the video came hours after his family made a direct appeal to IS to contact them. IS - also known as Isis or Isil - has seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and declared a new caliphate - or Islamic state. Militants from the extremist group have killed two US hostages in recent weeks, posting video evidence on the internet. They threatened to kill Mr Haines during a video posted online showing the killing of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month. The extremist group also killed fellow US journalist James Foley last month.", "summary": "最新视频显示英国人质大卫·海恩斯怀疑遭伊斯兰国（IS）武装斩首，英国首相卡梅伦谴责此举是“纯粹的魔鬼行为”。"}

The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored. However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness. The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off. How was it done? Thirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir. Four hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University. It rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells. The pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours. What did the study show? The study, published in the journal Nature, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity. The researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate. The brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain. This was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated. Crucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception. Fundamentally they were still dead brains. What have we learned? The research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen. Prof Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: \"Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought. \"What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process. \"And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed.\" Are these experiments ethical? The pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment. But the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity. And the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions. In that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment. Ethicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a \"grey area - not alive, but not completely dead\". What is the point? The immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer's. The organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain. In the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth. Dr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: \"This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain. \"It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow.\" However, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury. Prof Sestan said: \"We don't yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function.\" Does this change the meaning of death? At the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are \"brain dead\" are a major source of organs for transplant. Prof Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: \"Once someone has been diagnosed as 'brain dead' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover. \"The human person that they were has gone forever. \"If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone's mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death.\" But that is not currently the case. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar. \"It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality.\" Could the pigs' brains be aware? In this experiment the answer is a clear no. The brains were effectively silent. But the research does ask as many questions as it answers: Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "美国科学家最近成功使被屠宰死亡4个小时后的猪脑“部分复活”，让脑细胞重新恢复一些基本功能。"}

Galbraith's novels follow private detective Cormoran Strike, a former military police investigator in the Special Investigation Branch. Rowling, who began using the pseudonym for her crime writing career after completing the Harry Potter series, said the third Robert Galbraith novel would centre on returning military personnel. \"The next book is quite different,\" she said. \"You find out quite a bit more about what happens to people after they leave the military.\" Rowling was interviewed on stage in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, on Friday by fellow crime author Val McDermid.

It's pretty open ended. \"I really love writing these books, so I don't know that I've got an end point in mind. \"One of the things I absolutely love about this genre is that, unlike Harry, where there was an overarching story, a beginning and an end, you're talking about discrete stories.

The 1:12 initiative is backed by Switzerland Young Socialists, who gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to call a referendum. It is the second time this year the Swiss have voted on top salaries: in March they voted overwhelmingly to curb big bonuses, and to ban golden handshakes and goodbyes. Both votes reflect growing anger in Switzerland at revelations that some of the country's chief executives are earning more than 200 times what their employees take home. It emerged earlier this year that Swiss banking giant UBS had awarded $2.6m (£1.6m) in bonuses - the figure matched exactly the bank's losses over 2012. \"In the last couple of years these managers were really earning a lot - too much,\" says Corinne Fankhauser, of the Young Socialists. \"For example, the chief executive of Credit Suisse, he was earning at one point 820 times what his [lowest-paid] employees were earning. So it's kind of crazy these wages. We want to stop this.\" Appearing greedy The Young Socialists have devised some clever campaign tactics: handing out free chocolate chip cookies on the streets, and telling passers by they can take as many as 12 if they want. Of course, no-one does, because no-one wants to appear quite so greedy. The same attitude, the young socialists argue, should apply to executive pay. But while the multi-million-dollar salaries paid out at the big banks are hitting the headlines, they are not the full picture. The real backbone of Switzerland's economy are the hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises across the country. The scheme would also affect them, and among their managers opinions are mixed. Quality 'the priority' Thomas Gerber is owner and chief executive of Amarena AG, a kitchen and furniture company. The business is small, but it has clients on four continents. Mr Gerber has eight staff members and earns just 1.3 times what his employees do. He has no desire for more. \"I think it's very bad for Switzerland's image, for us as manufacturers, if we're only ever in the headlines because of these exorbitant salaries for managers,\" he explains. \"Switzerland is not just a lot of big companies, we are a society. I think we have to return to quality products… They are the important part of our business, not huge salaries.\" 'Stupid rulings' But not everyone shares Mr Gerber's point of view. Many owners and managers fear the proposed restrictions risk punishing all of Switzerland's enterprises because of the high-profile mistakes of a few. In line with company policy, Kurt Schaer, owner and director of BikeTec AG, which makes electrically powered bicycles, earns about five times what his staff earn, and he, too, says he does not want more. \"Of course I'm against too high salaries,\" he insists. \"It's not good for the image. But basically we don't want to have influence from the government into the companies. It's a free decision of the shareholders how much they want to pay the management and the employees.\" And, Mr Schaer warns, passing 1:12 would cost his company time and money proving to government auditors that BikeTec is obeying pay restrictions it already adheres to. \"We would have to hire more people in our accounting department,\" he says. \"I'd like to spend money to create new products, to create new markets… not spend money just to follow some stupid rulings.\" Salaries 'driven downwards' The Swiss government, too, is not keen on 1:12, pointing out that Switzerland has a relatively successful tradition of social partnership between business leaders and workers. \"Our way of agreeing salaries has led to lots of good jobs and very low unemployment,\" claims Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann. \"I call it the Swiss recipe for success. I don't want to put this valuable system at risk. \"[If the vote is passed] the lowest wages would not really rise, it's far more likely all salaries would be driven downwards.\" Some business leaders have also argued that limiting salaries in such an extreme way would mean Switzerland's leading enterprises would not be able to attract the top people if they could not pay top salaries. But this argument has not been aired too widely, simply because over the last few months polls have shown that the very mention of high salaries irritates Swiss voters. What has had more resonance has been the argument that foreign businesses might decide against setting up in Switzerland because of salary restrictions - something which opponents argue would lead to an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in tax revenue. But ultimately neither the government nor business leaders will have the final say. Instead, in the long tradition of Swiss direct democracy, the voters will decide. The opinion polls have been close, although the latest indicates that voters may believe 1:12 is a step too far. But the fact that Switzerland is holding a nationwide referendum at all, just months after clamping down on bonuses, is a message to those high-earning bosses in the really big companies that excessive salaries - like 12 cookies - looks just plain greedy.", "summary": "瑞士选民将在本周日（24日）进行民调公投，对新制定的法律进行严格限定，来限制高层管理者的薪酬。"}

The swing factor between a continuing stable but uninspiring global recovery and relapse into a global downturn is China. The big question is: how steep is China's economic slowdown? Those looking for an answer have pointed to China's surprise decision to devalue its currency in early August. Does this suggest that policy-makers are panicking and trying to boost exports? The fundamental problem that China faces is that its economy is deeply unbalanced - both internally and externally - at a time that it is also slowing. Economists tend to look at an economy for internal balance (a state of affairs in which neither employment nor inflation is too high or too low) and external balance (a situation in which a country's current account (its borrowing or lending to the rest of the world) is neither too high nor too low. China is currently struggling to achieve both kinds of balance. Chinese policy-makers have a tricky task ahead but not unmanageable one. It's a challenge that could be made much easier by some global policy co-ordination and co-operation. At the heart of China's problem is the \"impossible trinity\" of international macroeconomics. The impossible trinity - or trilemma - is the idea that it is impossible for a country to have three things at the same time: a stable currency, the free movement of capital (i.e. the absence of capital controls) and independent monetary policy. A country can instead choose just two of the options from this policy suite. The UK, in common with most developed economies, has free capital movement and an independent monetary policy - but not a controlled exchange rate. The Bank of England sets interest rates at a level it thinks is right for the UK economy and - as capital can flow into and out of the UK at will - the exchange rate is determined by the market. Change in outlook? If, as in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UK wanted to retain free movement of capital but have a stable exchange rate then it would cease to have an independent monetary policy. Instead of being set as appropriate for UK domestic conditions, the interest rate would have to be set to maintain the value of sterling against other currencies - in effect monetary policy would be outsourced. China's policy mix has been to have an independent monetary policy and a controlled exchange rate, which has meant restrictions of the free movement of capital. In reality the situation is a bit more complicated. China's capital controls are porous, money does flow in and out of the country and the renmimbi has been semi-pegged to the dollar, rather than straight-forwardly stable. But things are changing. China is currently pushing for the renmimbi to be formally included in the International Monetary Fund's list of reserve currencies. Part of that process involves dismantling its capital controls bit that exposes its own central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to the trilemma. The slowing domestic economy suggests an easier monetary stance is required and that an easier monetary stance, coupled with freer movement of capital, suggests that a weaker renmimbi lies ahead. But as Karthik Sankaran of Eurasia Group has convincingly argued this wouldn't be ideal either for China or for the global economy. Domestically, a weaker currency would tighten financial conditions for any Chinese company that has borrowed in dollars at a time when the PBOC was trying to ease them. But the international spill-overs of a weaker Chinese currency matter more. What China needs Before the financial crisis of 2008 China's economy was far from externally balanced - indeed it was a major driver of global imbalance, with a current account surplus of 10% of GDP. That's now down to around 2%, but a weaker currency could force it back up. At a time when disinflationary factors, such as lower commodity prices, are at work and when Western inflation is stuck around 0%, then the last thing the world needs is a Chinese devaluation which would risk turning a still benign period of low inflation into a damaging spell of deflation. China needs easier monetary policy and the world could do without a much weaker renmimbi. Thankfully that is an achievable mix. But it requires Chinese capital controls to stay in place for longer than intended - giving China the ability to both have an independent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate. The IMF was once regarded as fairly dogmatic on the need for countries to sign up to the free movement of capital. But during the crisis that attitude shifted and the Fund recognised that there are times when capital controls might be appropriate. China right now feels like one of those times. If China can keep its capital controls while moving towards reserve currency status - even for a while - it may be better placed to seek balance. It's very easy to attack China's economic policy missteps of the past few years. Propping up an overvalued stock market and surprising the market with currency announcements are just the latest examples. But the bigger criticism is usually over the nature of the post-2009 stimulus package - which kept Chinese growth high by going on a credit and investment binge driven by state owned enterprises, state owned banks and local government. That's left the Chinese economy with a serious mal-investment problem (the often mentioned empty ghost cities) and high level of debt. But, for all the criticism, the counterfactual is rarely stated. What would global growth have looked like without it? At a time when the world was desperately short of economic demand, China stepped up and provided some. That stimulus package helped prop up global growth during the crisis but left China's economy dangerously out of balance. Helping China make the transition back towards balance needs to be a central aim for global policymakers.", "summary": "本周末举行的二十国集团（G20）会议 给环球经济写下了相对乐观的注脚 ，与最近环球金融资本市场的价格下跌形成鲜明对比。"}

The FLA says it has now secured agreements to reduce hours, protect pay, and improve staff representation. Apple said it \"fully accepted\" the report's recommendations. \"We share the FLA's goal of improving lives and raising the bar for manufacturing companies everywhere,\" it said in a statement. The findings emerged as Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Foxconn facilities. Mr Cook toured Zhengzhou Technology Park, where 120,000 employees work, on Wednesday. A string of suicides at Foxconn last year put the spotlight on working conditions at its factories. Last month, the company announced it was to send independent inspectors from the FLA to audit the facilities. Legal limits The investigation - one of the largest ever conducted of a US company's operations abroad - found employees often worked more than 60 hours a week and sometimes for seven days running without the required day off. Other violations included unpaid overtime and health and safety risks. Average monthly salaries at the three factories ranged from $360 (£227) to $455 (£289). Foxconn raised salaries by up to 25% recently. The FLA said Foxconn had agreed to comply with the association's standards on working hours by July 2013, bringing them in line with a legal limit in China of 49 hours per week. The company will hire thousands more workers in order to compensate for the move, Reuters reports. The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says the report has been much anticipated as embodying a new and transparent approach to an old problem: that of cheap but popular consumer goods manufactured in poor conditions in developing countries. However, he says, a telling line in the report is the one which notes that the Foxconn workers did not have true trade union representation. The authorities in China are very wary of unions and are likely to remain so. Before the report was released, labour unions expressed doubts that the company was committed to improving standards. \"The report will include new promises by Apple that stand to be just as empty as the ones made over the past 5 years,\" SumOfUS.org, a coalition of trade unions and consumer groups, said.

The prime minister said Mr Gates was wrong and that the UK was a \"first class-player in terms of defence\". Mr Gates also questioned whether \"artificial\" states in the Middle East \"like Libya, Iraq and Syria can be held together absent of repression\". Mr Gates, who served under presidents Obama and Bush, told the BBC that was because they were made up of \"historically adversarial groups\". And he said that although it was unlikely to happen, the US did have the capability to intervene in the Syrian conflict but lacked a \"broader strategy to deal with the broader conflicts in the Middle East\". 'Hollowed out' On the UK's military cuts, Mr Gates told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"With the fairly substantial reductions in defence spending in Great Britain, what we're finding is that it won't have full spectrum capabilities and the ability to be a full partner as they have been in the past.\" The spectrum refers to the ability of a country's military to fight across air, sea and land. Mr Gates singled out cuts to the Royal Navy as particularly damaging and he noted that - for the first time since World War One - Britain did not have an operational aircraft carrier. Mr Gates warned against nuclear disarmament by the UK, but acknowledged that there was scope for changes to the way the deterrent was deployed. Mr Gates's comments echo the concerns of other senior military figures. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned last month Britain could be left with the \"spectre\" of a hollowed-out force. Admiral Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, told the BBC the government had underestimated how important the government's relationship with the US was and had not factored that in when deciding on the cuts. He also said the gap with no aircraft carrier, between scrapping the Ark Royal and the introduction of a new aircraft carrier in 2020, represented a \"huge risk\". Under the government's proposals, by 2020 the Army will lose 20,000 soldiers, the Royal Navy 6,000 personnel and the RAF 5,000 - although there are also plans to increase the number of reservists in each service. Prime Minister David Cameron said he did not agree with Mr Gates's comments about Britain's future military capability. \"We have the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world. We are investing in future capabilities,\" he said. \"We are a first-class player in terms of defence and as long as I am prime minster that is the way it will stay.\" Jonathan Beale, the BBC's defence correspondent said the American's latest intervention would be unlikely to reverse the cuts but would wound Britain's pride. The Ministry of Defence said the UK - like the US - had had to take \"tough decisions\" on defence spending but had \"the best trained and best equipped armed forces outside the US\". In a statement, it added: \"Over the next decade, we plan to spend £160bn on equipment, to ensure our armed forces retain their formidable range of cutting-edge capabilities and ability to project power across the globe, including by maintaining our major naval presence in the Gulf Region. \"Construction of the first new aircraft carrier, the largest ship the Royal Navy has ever operated, is almost complete and the navy will also operate state-of-the-art Type 45 destroyers, new Type-26 Frigates, and seven new Astute Class submarines.\" And former Defence Secretary Liam Fox told the Today programme Britain was \"one of only four or five countries inside Nato\" to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. \"America is the world's biggest economy with the world's biggest defence budget. We're the world's eighth biggest economy with the fourth biggest defence budget, so certainly we're pulling our weight on that,\" he said. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the prime minister should be worried about the concerns of \"Britain's strongest ally\". \"It's clear that there needs to be a rebalancing after withdrawal from Afghanistan and the closure of bases in Germany,\" he said. \"And no-one is disputing the financial constraints within which the UK military must operate. But the government must ensure that Britain's defence capability is maintained.\" Stop the War Coalition convenor Lindsey German said \"many people in the country don't particularly like the special relationship with the US\" and would not be concerned by Mr Gates's comments.

He said he is no longer taking recreational drugs but admitted he still \"drinks a bit\".

When asked if he would stop drinking, Sheen responded by saying: \"Perhaps the freedom of today might lead to that as well.\" Sheen said his \"personal disbelief and shame and anger\" at the initial diagnosis \"led to a descent into substance abuse and fathomless drinking\". But now he feels he has \"the responsibility to better myself and help a lot of other people. With what we're doing today, others may come up and say, 'Thanks Charlie, thanks for kicking the door open'.\" He said he hoped the media pressure would ease now. \"You can never predict how the media will roll with something,\" he said. \"I hope it's a lot more forgiving and supportive than a lot of the garbage I've read over the past few days - that I knew I had Aids and was intentionally spreading it. \"It's as far from the truth as can be.\" HIV facts by Michelle Roberts, Health editor, BBC website There are many different ways that you might catch HIV, but the main ones are having unprotected sex or sharing needles or syringes. HIV is transmitted via blood, not saliva, but it is possible to catch HIV through unprotected oral sex (although the risk is much lower than with vaginal or anal sex). Once infected, the virus attacks the person's immune system, making them more prone to other infections and diseases. There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that mean people with the virus can live a long and healthy life. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment. The actor rose to fame in the 80s with hit films including Platoon and Wall Street and, in 2011, was the highest-paid actor on TV thanks to his sitcom role. But he has frequently struggled with drink and drug abuse. The star, who played a hedonistic bachelor in Two And A Half Men, was fired from the show in 2011 after a downward spiral in his personal life, often played out in public. Production had been suspended after he entered rehabilitation for reported drug and alcohol abuse. The actor - the youngest son of West Wing star Martin Sheen and brother of actor Emilio Estevez - has also had a colourful personal life and has been married three times. Sheen's first daughter, Cassandra was born to his former high school girlfriend. His first marriage, to Donna Peele, ended after a year. His second marriage was to former Bond girl Denise Richards, with whom he has two daughters. They divorced in 2006 and he married Brooke Mueller, with whom he has twin sons. He was then due to marry adult film star Scottine Ross, but the wedding was called off.

And in Europe, the Swedish city of Gothenburg has given Volvo permission to test 100 driverless cars - although that trial is not scheduled to occur until 2017. Competition cash UK cities wanting to host one of the trials have until the start of October to declare their interest. The tests are then intended to run for between 18 to 36 months. A £10m fund has been created to cover their costs, with the sum to be divided between the three winners. Meanwhile, civil servants have been given until the end of this year to publish a review of road regulations. This will cover the need for self-drive vehicles to comply with safety and traffic laws, and involve changes to the Highway Code, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales. Two area will be examined by the review: how the rules should apply to vehicles in which the driver can take back control at short notice, and how they should apply to vehicles in which there is no driver. How do driverless cars work? The label \"driverless vehicle\" actually covers a lot of different premises. Indeed, the cruise control, automatic braking, anti-lane drift and self-parking functions already built into many vehicles offer a certain degree of autonomy. But the term is generally used to refer to vehicles that take charge of steering, accelerating, indicating and braking during most if not all of a journey between two points, much in the same way aeroplanes can be set to autopilot. Unlike the skies, however, the roads are much more crowded, and a range of technologies are being developed to tackle the problem. One of the leading innovations is Lidar (light detection and ranging), a system that measures how lasers bounce off reflective surfaces to capture capture information about millions of small points surrounding the vehicle every second. The technology is already used to create the online maps used by Google and Nokia. Another complimentary technique is \"computer vision\" - the use of software to make sense of 360-degree images captured by cameras attached to the vehicle, which can warn of pedestrians, cyclists, roadworks and other objects that might be in the vehicle's path. Autonomous vehicles can also make use of global-positioning system (GPS) location data from satellites; radar; ultrasonic sensors to detect objects close to the car; and further sensors to accurately measure the vehicle's orientation and the rotation of its wheels, to help it understand its exact location. The debate now is whether to allow cars, like the prototype unveiled by Google in May, to abandon controls including a steering wheel and pedals and rely on the vehicle's computer. Or whether, instead, to allow the machine to drive, but insist a passenger be ready to wrest back control at a moment's notice. International rivals In May, Google unveiled plans to manufacture 100 self-driving vehicles. The search-giant exhibited a prototype which has no steering wheel or pedals - just a stop-go button. Google has also put its autonomous driving technology in cars built by other companies, including Toyota, Audi and Lexus. Other major manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and General Motors, are developing their own models. Most recently, the Chinese search engine Baidu also declared an interest, saying its research labs were at an \"early stage of development\" on a driverless car project. But concerns about the safety of driverless cars have been raised by politicians in the US and elsewhere. Earlier this month, the FBI warned that driverless cars could be used as lethal weapons, predicting that the vehicles \"will have a high impact on transforming what both law enforcement and its adversaries can operationally do with a car\".", "summary": "英国政府周三（7月30日）宣布，英国将于明年1月起允许无人驾驶汽车出现在英国的公路上。"}

Myanmar has emerged as a top producer of illegal drugs in recent years. The senior monk, named only as Arsara, was arrested after police discovered the first consignment of tablets in his car as he was driving to the town of Maungdaw bordering Bangladesh. The second batch in the monastery was found after he was arrested. Arsara is well known among the Buddhist community in Maungdaw, The Irrawaddy reported, and had been a leading monk at the town's Baho monastery. Myanmar is notorious for producing vast quantities of methamphetamines, opium and cannabis, with drug trafficking a particular problem in Rakhine state. Myanmar's illicit drug trade has flourished because of its mountainous land and porous borders. Local reports cited by The Irrawaddy say that in late September 2016 police in Maungdaw carried out two huge drug hauls, raking in more than 15 million amphetamine tablets from the compound of a construction company. Police in Yangon seized methamphetamine tablets with an estimated value of more than $100m (£64m) in an abandoned truck in 2015.

But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: \"I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead.\" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. What do we know about what happened? Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. What was said in court? Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted \"violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse\". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. \"When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,\" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had \"wanted to spare her family\" the \"gruesome details.\" Unclear answers Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as \"terrible\". During the session, the prosecution said: The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. Who was Kim Wall? The journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the \"Oxbridge of journalism\".

As countries have imposed travel bans in a bid to combat the outbreak they have imposed the same restrictions on travellers from Taiwan as from China, authorities have said. The spread of Covid-19 has brought the Taiwan dispute back to prominence. While it has won international praise for its handling of the health crisis, it is not a member of the World Health Organization (WHO). China has not allowed it to attend any WHO meetings since 2016. Taiwan has governed itself since 1949, when the mainland government fled to the island after its defeat by the Communist Party in China's civil war.

He said that the use of Zoom had soared in ways he could never have foreseen prior to the coronavirus pandemic. One security expert said he hoped the company culture would change. Zoom is now being used by millions of people for work and leisure, as lockdowns are imposed in many countries. Eric Yuan spoke candidly about how \"usage of Zoom ballooned overnight\". \"As of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, was approximately 10 million. In March this year, we reached more than 200 million, he said. He admitted that despite \"working around the clock\" to support the influx of new users, the service had \"fallen short of the community's - and our own - privacy and security expectations\". \"For that, I am deeply sorry,\" he wrote. \"We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socialising from home,\" he wrote. \"We now have a much broader set of users who are utilising our product in a myriad of unexpected ways presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.\" Zoom has been criticised for a range of privacy issues, including sending user data to Facebook, wrongly claiming the app had end-to-end encryption, and allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. Ex-NSA (National Security Agency) hacker Patrick Wardle identified a series of issues, including a flaw which left Mac users vulnerable to having webcams and microphones hijacked. Security consultant Graham Cluley said that Zoom faced \"a crisis\". \"It risked losing a large amount of goodwill it had received because of revelations about its less-than-perfect attitude towards security and privacy.\" The fact that it was addressing some of the \"alarming vulnerabilities\" and had recognised the need to focus on security rather than \"adding bells and whistles\" was good news, he said. \"Let's hope that the company's culture will change from its previous 'fast and loose' attitude when it comes to such concerns,\" he added. Zoombombing The huge uptake of Zoom has created the new phenomenon of 'zoombombing' which sees uninvited guests join video conferences, usually to shout abuse, share pornography or make racist remarks. The mischief-makers find out the details of the meetings either via links that have been shared publicly on social media platforms or websites or, in some cases, by simply guessing the nine digit ID code. It is reasonably easy to prevent attacks by password protecting meetings and not allowing anyone other than the host to screen-share. Mr Yuan, who founded Zoom in 2011, said steps the firm had taken to address concerns included: And over the next 90 days it plans to: Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at Trend Micro, welcomed the changes. \"These issues run the full gamut: from configuration and lax default settings, software vulnerabilities, corporate policy and product roadmap decisions, and that it painfully clear from the blog post.\" \"One has to feel some sympathy for an organisation that was one of the first to offer free services during the pandemic and found itself not just a victim of poor decision-making, but also a victim of its own success.\" 'High-risk' There has been debate in the UK about whether the government should be using Zoom for cabinet meetings. The government justified its use during \"unprecedented times\" when some members of government were self-isolating and did not have access to more secure technology at home. But the debate intensified when prime minister Boris Johnson tweeted a picture which included the ID number of the latest meeting. It is also reported that Elon Musk has banned the use of Zoom for SpaceX meetings, citing security concerns. Nasa, which is one of Space X's biggest customers, also prevents employees from using it. Mr Cluley said anyone using it for sensitive conversations needed to be careful. \"Fixing these problems will take time. And those particularly high-risk users of Zoom, having highly sensitive discussions on the service, who might potentially be the target of state-sponsored attacks (for instance the UK cabinet), might be wise to find alternative, more secure methods of communication in the meantime.\"", "summary": "在全球用户提出批评后，通讯软体Zoom宣布暂停任何新功能的开发，以专注于安全和隐私问题。"}

And they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely. Another thing that sets them apart is their \"true\" loss of taste. It's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journal Rhinology. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet. Experts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation. The main symptoms of coronavirus are: Anyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have a swab test to check if they have the virus. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread. Smell research Lead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms. Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all. Prof Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: \"There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses. \"This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu.\" He said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar. He stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus. The senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added. Prof Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US. He and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in the European Respiratory Journal. They identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling. This enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the \"entry point\" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection. The nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body. Prof Lane said: \"We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body. \"If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.\"", "summary": "感染新型冠状病毒之后可能伴随的嗅觉丧失是一种独特症状，研究过此类病人体验的欧洲研究人员表示，它与患上重感冒或者流感的人所经历的嗅觉丧失有所不同。"}

The ONS realised after the 2011 census that its previous projections had overlooked many people entering the UK. A review found the main reason was \"inadequate sampling\" of migrants. 'Out of control' Net migration is the number of people moving to the UK minus the number leaving. The government wants it cut to under 100,000 by the next general election - but it currently stands at more than 200,000. The ONS's review looked into the quality of migration estimates, which are based largely on the International Passenger Survey (IPS) - a system designed to collect information about passengers entering and leaving the UK. The IPS found some citizens coming into the UK from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia had not been counted between 2004 and 2008. This was partly because IPS interviews focused on major airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester - at the expense of regional hubs which were increasingly being used by migrants, the ONS said. Regional airports in the UK were either not covered at all by the IPS or not fully covered, the ONS said. Improvements were later made to the IPS, and from 2008 more interviews were conducted at major regional airports such as Luton and Stansted. The ONS said: \"There is evidence that shows the IPS missed a substantial amount of immigration of EU8 citizens [from the eight Eastern European countries named] that occurred between 2004 and 2008, prior to IPS improvements from 2009. \"This is evident from comparisons of IPS data with a number of other data sources related to immigration.\" 'Better data needed' Migration Watch UK chairman Sir Andrew Green said: \"This is final confirmation that net foreign immigration under Labour totalled nearly four million, two-thirds from outside the European Union. \"It also shows that the peak of net migration was almost 275,000 a year, making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to the tens of thousands.\" Downing Street said David Cameron had \"confidence\" in the ONS.

It is believed about one million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what what the Chinese state defines as \"re-education\" camps. China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China to \"immediately end these horrific practices\". In a statement, he urged \"all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses\". China has faced mounting global scrutiny over its treatment of Uighurs in recent years. An investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested that children in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their families in an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities. What's in the report? Mr Zenz's report was based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women in Xinjiang. It alleges that Uighur women and other ethnic minorities are being threatened with internment in the camps for refusing to abort pregnancies that exceed birth quotas. It also says women who had fewer than the two children legally permitted were involuntarily fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs), while others were coerced into receiving sterilisation surgeries. \"Since a sweeping crackdown starting in late 2016 transformed Xinjiang into a draconian police state, witness accounts of intrusive state interference into reproductive autonomy have become ubiquitous,\" the report says. According to Mr Zenz's analysis of the data, natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically in recent years, with growth rates falling by 84% in the two largest Uighur prefectures between 2015 and 2018 and declining further in 2019. \"This kind of drop is unprecedented, there's a ruthlessness to it,\" Mr Zenz told the Associated Press. \"This is part of a wider control campaign to subjugate the Uighurs.\" Former detainees in internment camps in Xinjiang said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs. \"Overall, it is likely that Xinjiang authorities are engaging in the mass sterilization of women with three or more children,\" the report said. Politicians call for UN investigation In a statement on Monday, the Interparliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), an international cross-party group of politicians including Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, and US senator Marco Rubio, called on the UN to \"establish an international, impartial, independent investigation into the situation in the Xinjiang region\". \"A body of mounting evidence now exists, alleging mass incarceration, indoctrination, extrajudicial detention, invasive surveillance, forced labor, and the destruction of Uyghur cultural sites, including cemeteries, together with other forms of abuse,\" the statement said. \"The world cannot remain silent in the face of unfolding atrocities. Our countries are bound by solemn obligations to prevent and punish any effort to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group 'in whole or in part'.\" Coverage of China's hidden camps According to a report by the Associated Press published on Monday, women in Xinjiang have faced exorbitant fines and threats of internment for breaching childbearing limits. Gulnar Omirzakh, a Chinese-born Kazakh, was ordered to get an IUD inserted after having her third child, the AP reported. Two years later, in January 2018, four officials in military camouflage knocked at her door anyway and handed Omirzakh, the penniless wife of a detained vegetable trader, three days to pay a 17,5000 RMB (£2,000) fine for having more than two children. She was reportedly warned that she would join her husband in an internment camp if she refused to pay. \"God bequeaths children on you. To prevent people from having children is wrong,\" Omirzakh told the AP. \"They want to destroy us as a people.\" Responding to the report on Monday, China's foreign ministry said the allegations were \"baseless\" and showed \"ulterior motives\". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused media outlets of \"cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues\". For decades, under China's one-child policy, urban minorities were instead allowed two children, or three for rural families. A 2017 policy change, under President Xi Jinping, removed the ethnic distinction, permitting Han Chinese to have the same number of children as minorities, while preserving the urban-rural distinction. But according to the AP, Han Chinese have been largely spared the abortions, sterilisations, IUD insertions and detentions implemented against minority populations, including the Uighurs. Mr Zenz's report characterises the alleged campaign of coercive birth control in Xinjiang as part of a \"demographic campaign of genocide\" against the Uighurs. \"These findings provide the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's policies in Xinjiang meet one of the genocide criteria cited in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,\" he writes.", "summary": "中国被指在新疆强迫维族妇女节育、绝育，以期控制维族穆斯林人口。有专家解读，中国利用计划生育措施在新疆推行“变相种族灭绝”。"}

He was already known to be estranged from the princess, although they continued to attend official functions together. Letter The purge of Princess Srirasmi's family over the past 10 days has been widely reported in Thailand. However, until now the severity of the lese majeste law criminalising any critical comment about the monarchy meant that no Thai media had pointed out the family connection. The princess's uncle, a senior police general, was arrested over accusations of amassing vast wealth through smuggling and gambling rackets. Four of her siblings and two other relatives have also been held. The office of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has now sent a letter to the interior ministry ordering her family to be stripped of the royal name he bestowed on them when he married her. The dramatic downfall of Princess Srirasmi comes at a very sensitive time, analysts say, with the 86 year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej in poor health. As the Crown Prince's wife, she would have been expected to become Queen when he succeeds his father, a potentially very powerful position given the exalted status of the monarchy in Thailand. The pivotal position of the monarchy in Thailand's political order makes the succession an extremely sensitive issue, many aspects of which still cannot be reported from inside the country.

The report for the National Union of Students and the million+ university group calls on the government to do more for mature students. The government says financial worries should not deter anyone from study. The report draws on figures from the admissions body UCAS which show that applications from people aged 21 or over for full-time degree courses starting in 2012-13 have fallen by 11.4% since last year. This is compared with a drop of 6.6% from applicants aged 17 to 20. Applications for university places from UK students fell by an average of 9% for this autumn, the start of higher undergraduate fees of up to £9,000 a year. 'Debt averse' The report, Never too Late to Learn, says the drop in applications is evidence that higher undergraduate tuition fees may act as a deterrent to prospective mature students who tend to be debt averse. The authors say fewer mature students would be a concern as they currently represent a fifth of all full-time undergraduates. A third of undergraduates start university for the first time when they are over 21 and more than half (57%) of these study full time. A spokesman for the Department of Business Innovation and Skills said: \"Mature students make a valuable contribution to higher education, bringing real-world experience, knowledge and skills into the classroom. \"New students do not have to pay upfront. Instead they can make manageable monthly repayments as graduates once they are in well paid work. \"Repayments are for a maximum of 30 years with any remaining balance written off after that time.\" The report points out that mature students are less likely to have the usual set of A-level qualifications expected of school leavers. They are also more likely to study part-time and locally, to be from ethnic minorities and to have disabilities. The study calls on the government to take into account the more complex financial circumstances of many prospective mature students when publicising the benefits of a degree. Loan repayment It says the impact of the changes in fees and student support schemes on mature students should be carefully monitored. In particular, it mentions that longer repayment periods for loans could be a particular problem for mature graduates if they are still having to pay them off as they near retirement. Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students said: \"Mature students report financial hardship as one of the key challenges they face. \"We can't ignore the significant drop in full-time applications from mature applicants for the coming year, and we need to understand the reasons for this and prompt a change of direction in the government's approach.\" Professor Patrick McGhee, chairman of million+ said: \"This report is a timely reminder that social mobility is not just about young people .... contrary to popular perception university isn't just for 18 year olds with A-levels. \"This is something we should be proud of - it's a unique strength of our system - but it also means that we have a responsibility to preserve, protect and promote opportunities for people to study whatever their age, background and family, financial or work commitments.\"", "summary": "有专家调查显示，英格兰各大学普遍大幅提高学费的作法已经造成入学申请数量出现明显下降。"}

The kingdom has also pledged to relax its strict dress codes for female visitors, and to allow women to travel to the country unaccompanied. This is all part of the kingdom's push for economic reform, in order to decrease its dependence on oil - but it is also an attempt to rebrand itself amid criticism of its human rights record, including last year's murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and crackdowns on women's rights activists. There are also some caveats. Women will still need to dress modestly in public, and non-Muslims will still be forbidden from visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. So what can Saudi's new tourists expect to see? Al Wahbah volcanic crater In the middle of the desert, some 250 km (155 miles) away from the city of Taif, is Al Wahbah - a large volcanic crater with a salt field in its centre. Al Wahbah has become popular with hikers in recent years, although it is a challenge. As the crater is 820 ft deep, it takes competent hikers about two to three hours to get down to the bottom and back up again. For those hoping for something a bit less active, it is also a popular camping spot. The ancient city of Mada'in Saleh Mada'in Saleh was the second largest city of the Nabateans, a group of people who settled across ancient Arabia and the Jordan Valley until their empire was annexed by the Romans in 106 CE. Now, among the ruins are a vast necropolis with 130 tombs, small pre-Islamic altars, and some adobe houses - structures made from earth - in what used to be the city's living quarters. Mada'in Saleh was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2008 - the first site in Saudi Arabia to get this accolade. Historic Jeddah and the Gate to Mecca Another Unesco World Heritage Site is the Gate to Mecca, located in Historic Jeddah. In the 7th Century CE, Jeddah was established as both a major port for Indian Ocean trade routes, and the entry point for Muslim pilgrims who arrived by sea on their way to the religious city of Mecca. Masmak Fortress in Riyadh Masmak Fortress in the Saudi capital Riyadh was first built in about 1865 - but it is most well known for what happened 37 years later. In 1902, the exiled royal, Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud, returned to his ancestral hometown Riyadh and seized this fortress. Based at Masmak, he went on to conquer the different kingdoms of the region, before eventually uniting them to form what is now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Fahd's Fountain King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah is said to be the tallest fountain in the world. Conservative estimates say the fountain, which was donated to the city by the late King Fahd, can shoot saltwater up to 853 ft (260 metres) high - although some estimates put this closer to 1,000 ft. At night, it is lit up by more than 500 spotlights. Umluj - aka the Saudi Maldives The sandy beaches of Umluj - often referred to as the Saudi Maldives - are on the country's Red Sea coast. From the beach you can see mountains and inactive volcanoes, while there are mango farms nearby. Neolithic art of Jubbah and Shuwaymis According to Unesco there was once a lake near these rock formations, which made it an important gathering spot for humans and animals. While here our Neolithic ancestors left their mark, in the form of these drawings on the rock faces of Jubbah and Shuwaymis. What is it like to visit Saudi Arabia? James Merriman - from Barnstaple, England - visited Riyadh in 2014 on a three-day transit visa. \"I visited Masmak Fortress, part of old Riyadh. Inside is a small museum which includes photos of old Riyadh from the early 20th century. Nearby is Deira Square which is the main public square of the city. It does, however, have a more sinister use for the location where public executions are carried out, hence it's nickname 'chop-chop square'. \"Modern Riyadh is all about grand shopping malls and large skyscrapers situated on the grand King Fahd Road. The Kingdom Center is the largest (the building with a gap at the top like a bottle opener). Tourists can visit the observation desk at the top for impressive views over the city. \"The best views of Riyadh at night are from the nearby Faisaliah Tower. From the top you are treated to a lovely view of the Kingdom Center tower lit up in different colours. But as it's an open-deck viewing platform it's very windy! \"For those wanting to try local cuisine, the locals like to eat camel meat. I would describe it similar to mutton but greasier. I preferred the excellent local dates and the refreshing non-alcoholic malt drinks.\" All pictures copyright", "summary": "沙特从9月28日起正式对包括中国在内的49个国家公民开放旅游签证申请。这是沙特首次向外国游客开放旅游签证。"}

Kiyoshi Mabuchi's Japanese team measured the friction of banana skin in the lab, and showed why apple and orange peel are not quite so hazardous. The Kitasato University group received the physics Ig for their insights. It is another classic of its type. The awards, which are run by the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research, can seem quite ridiculous at first. But when you delve deeper, you often see a serious intention beyond just the tongue in cheek. The Japanese scientists are interested in how friction and lubrication affect the movement of our limbs. The polysaccharide follicular gels that give banana skins their slippery properties are also found in the membranes where our bones meet. \"This concept will help to design a joint prosthesis,\" Kiyoshi Mabuchi told BBC News. Another winner this year was the study that examined the brains of people who see the face of Jesus and other figures in slices of toast. The work won the neuroscience Ig. Kang Lee, from the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues showed their subjects pictures of \"noise\" - like the random speckles you used to get on old, out-of-tune TVs - to see what patterns the volunteers would identify. This tendency to see order in randomness - like a face in the charred areas of a piece of bread - is a well-established phenomenon called pareidolia. Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Lee and his team saw how the same parts of the brain light up when we see non-existent faces as when we see real ones. \"Interestingly, when you superimpose all the noise images where these people say they see faces, and subtract all the noise images in which they told us they couldn't see faces - when we do this type of image processing, a face does actually show up,\" Prof Lee said. The Toronto scientist explained that this type of pattern recognition was hard-wired, and even chimps experienced it. \"The face you are going to see is determined by your personal expectations or beliefs,\" he added. \"So, for example, Buddhists might not see Jesus on toast, but they might see a Buddha on toast.\" This is the 24th year of the Ig Nobels, and they just get bigger and bigger. Marc Abrahams, the editor of Annals of Improbable Research, said scientists were clearly now doing studies with an eye to winning an Ig. \"We're getting about 9,000 nominations a year. About 10% to 20% are self-nominations, but these entries hardly ever win,\" he told BBC News. \"That's generally because they are just trying to be funny. Whereas, those who win perhaps don't start out that way, and only realise later on that what they are up to really is kind of funny.\" The full list of winners this year: PHYSICS: Kiyoshi Mabuchi, of Kitasato University, Japan, and colleagues, for measuring the amount of friction between a shoe and a banana skin, and between a banana skin and the floor, when a person steps on a banana skin that's on the floor. NEUROSCIENCE: Kang Lee, of the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues for trying to understand what happens in the brains of people who see the face of Jesus in a piece of toast. PSYCHOLOGY: Peter Jonason, of the University of Western Sydney, Australia, and colleagues for amassing evidence that people who habitually stay up late are, on average, more self-admiring, more manipulative, and more psychopathic than people who habitually arise early in the morning.

While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's \"common sense\" that human-induced heating is playing a role. Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record. UK researchers have carried out a rapid analysis of the impact of climate change on the risk of wildfires happening all over the world. Their study looked at 57 research papers published since the last major review of climate science came out in 2013. All the studies in the review showed links between climate change and the increased frequency or severity of fire weather. This is defined as those periods of time which have a higher risk of fire due to a combination of high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and high winds. The signal of human-induced warming has become clearer in different parts of the world with the passage of time. A paper published last year suggests the impact of climate change could be detected outside the range of natural variability in 22% of land that's available for burning. \"Overall, the 57 papers reviewed clearly show human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire,\" said Dr Matthew Jones, from the University of East Anglia, and the lead author of the review. \"This has been seen in many regions, including the western US and Canada, southern Europe, Scandinavia and Amazonia. Human-induced warming is also increasing fire risks in other regions, including Siberia and Australia.\" However, the review says that the dramatic fire situation witnessed in Australia in recent months is \"challenging to diagnose\". Naturally occurring weather patterns have played a significant role in creating the right conditions for wildfires. Conditions in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific have meant hot, dry spells across the country. But the influence of human-driven climate change is also in the mix. \"This (the fires) would have happened naturally but we can be confident that they have been made hotter because of man-made climate change,\" said Prof Betts. Speaking at the launch of the global review, he pointed to the fact that Australia is now about 1.4C warmer than the global average temperature was in the pre-industrial period. \"Temperatures in December in Australia, that have occurred recently, they are extreme for now but they would be normal under a world getting on for three degrees of warming, so we are seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3 degrees,\" Prof Betts explained. Right now, the world has warmed around 1C since the 1850s. Even with current government plans to limit emissions of CO2, the world is on course for around 3C of warming by the end of this century. Other experts involved in the review say that people are seeing the signal of global warming \"with their own eyes\" when it comes to wildfires and heatwaves. \"These are impacts we are seeing for one degree of global climate change. The impact will get worse as long as we don't do what it takes to stabilise the world's climate,\" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia in Norwich. \"And what it takes is to bring CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases down to net zero emissions. If we don't do it, we will have much worse impacts - so what we are seeing in Australia is not the new normal, it's a transition to worse impacts.\" The details of the papers included in the review can be found at the ScienceBrief online platform.

The Fed's moves, which have increased its balance sheet by more than $2.2tn so far, have been replicated to some degree by many other central banks, including the Bank of England. The responses, which typically complement massive new government spending packages, are an effort to keep money flowing despite the near-freeze on business activity during the pandemic. \"They've taken basically what they did in the global financial crisis and now it's on steroids,\" says Frederic Mishkin, a professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia Business School. 1. The Fed rushed dollars to foreign countries and financial firms The financial system was under strain this spring, as investors pulled funds out of a collapsing stock market, companies tapped credit lines in anticipation of lockdown losses and people in other countries looked to hold dollars for stability. Responding to the rush, the Fed used emergency powers to advance funds to major financial institutions. It also made it easier for foreign central banks to exchange their own currencies for dollars through so-called \"swap lines\". The Fed was able to respond quickly, since it had developed the programmes during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, says Alan Blinder, professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. But at that time, the Fed was trying to shield the wider economy from risky bank behaviour, whereas now the Fed is working to protect the financial system from the bigger economic crisis. \"That's not because they care about the bankers,\" Prof Blinder says. \"It's because if the financial system started to implode, which it had started to do, that's going to reverberate back onto the real economy and make things that much worse.\" 2. The Fed offered to buy debt from big companies But the Fed has gone beyond simply shoring up the financial system. Fearing a wave of bankruptcies, as shutdowns create holes in company budgets and worried banks refuse to lend, the Fed in March said it would work directly with big companies on loans and bond offerings. It pledged up to $100bn to the effort, and within weeks had expanded its potential commitment to $750bn. It has also said it would buy up to $100bn of other kinds of debt, including credit card debt, car financing loans, student loans, commercial mortgages and \"leveraged\" loans. The list is so extensive, some financial industry commentators on Twitter joked the bank would be buying baseball cards next. The US Treasury is backing the programmes with $85bn - a sign that unlike most of its actions in 2008, the Fed is worried about losses. Others have warned the bank's actions could encourage future risky borrowing. \"Markets work best when participants have a healthy fear of loss,\" Oaktree Capital Management co-founder Howard Marks wrote. \"It shouldn't be the role of the Fed or the government to eradicate it.\" Many economists say those kinds of fears are overblown, given the unique nature of the current coronavirus-triggered crisis - which has created cash-flow problems even for firms on a solid financial footing. \"I think this is such a large external shock, that I think it is appropriate for the central bank to come in to provide liquidity and try to prevent some of the costs [to society],\" says economist Nellie Liang, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of financial stability at the Fed. 3. The Fed is also lending to small businesses directly The Fed has announced it would launch its own \"Main Street\" lending operation, dedicating up to $600bn to fund low-cost four-year loans worth $1m-$25m for mid-sized firms - something it has never done before. The Treasury Department has put $75bn to the plans, which were announced after the government's small business aid programme was overwhelmed by demand. \"It's a big step for the Fed, but I think this crisis is unusual,\" says Ms Liang. \"The issues are not just market liquidity they're also liquidity for smaller firms that don't often have access to the market so to the extent that the Fed can provide some support here, it seems important.\" But, she adds: \"The Fed has to think really carefully about how to design the Main Street programme to help borrowers and not just increase their debt load.\" Indeed, many of the current economic problems can't be solved by lending, Prof Blinder warns, pointing to the need for the government to increase spending on items like healthcare and unemployment benefits. \"Will these activities help the economy weather the storm? The answer is yes, but the operative word in that sentence is help - the Fed cannot do this by itself,\" he says. 4. The Fed is also helping local governments. The increased costs of healthcare and social programmes, combined with plunging tax revenue, have created huge problems for local governments. Ordinarily, they could borrow money by issuing bonds. But that market seized up earlier this year, as the enormity of the crisis made investors wary about repayment. So, the Fed said it would buy up to $500bn in new bonds issued by states, cities and counties of a certain size - something else it has never done before. The Treasury Department is backing the effort with $35bn. The Fed's promise alone has appeared to re-set demand and help bring down the cost of borrowing, says Michael Belsky, executive director of the Center for Municipal Finance at Chicago University's Harris School of Public Policy. \"This is a godsend,\" he says. \"For the most part, I think it's a very creative and appropriate thing to be doing.\" But the Fed must guard against creating the expectation that it will be there to backstop cash-strapped local governments in the future, encouraging imbalanced budgets even in ordinary times, says Frederic Mishkin, professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia Business School. \"Although providing fiscal stimulus was the right thing to do, they've got to make very clear how unusual this is,\" he says. After all, the Fed has had difficulty dialling back its activity after the 2008 financial crisis. While many hope the current economic shock will be short-lived, the powers the Fed has assumed may well prove long-lasting.", "summary": "美国中央银行的决策层准备于本周召开网上会议，将研究他们目前为应对自“大萧条”（the Great Depression）以来最严重的经济危机所采取的措施是否奏效。"}

He now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a \"dangerous precedent\" where any journalist could face US charges for \"publishing truthful information about the United States\". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: \"I told you so.\" Assange had predicted that he would face extradition to the US if he left the embassy. What happened in court? After his arrest, the 47-year-old Australian national was initially taken to a central London police station before appearing in court. Dressed in a black suit and black polo shirt, he waved to the public gallery and gave a thumbs up. He pleaded not guilty to the 2012 charge of failing to surrender to the court. Finding him guilty of that charge, District Judge Michael Snow said Assange's behaviour was \"the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\". He sent him to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing, where he faces up to 12 months in prison. The court also heard that during his arrest at the embassy he had to be restrained and shouted: \"This is unlawful, I am not leaving.\" Why does the US government want to extradite Assange? Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted. Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files. What are the US charges against him? The indictment against Assange, issued last year in the state of Virginia, alleges that he conspired in 2010 with Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He faces up to five years in jail. Manning downloaded four databases from US departments and agencies between January and May 2010, the indictment says. This information, much of which was classified, was provided to Wikileaks. The US Justice Department described it as \"one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States\". Cracking a password stored on the computers, the indictment alleges, would have allowed Manning to log on to them in such a way as to make it harder for investigators to determine the source of the disclosures. It is unclear whether the password was actually broken. Correspondents say the narrowness of the charge seems intended to avoid falling foul of the US Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press. Why did the Ecuadorian embassy stop protecting him? The Wikileaks co-founder had been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The investigation into the alleged rape, which he denied, was later dropped because he had evaded the arrest warrant. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has said it is now considering whether to resume the inquiry before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020. Scotland Yard said it was invited into the embassy on Thursday by the ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government's withdrawal of asylum. Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno said the country had \"reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange\". Mr Moreno said: \"The most recent incident occurred in January 2019, when Wikileaks leaked Vatican documents. \"This and other publications have confirmed the world's suspicion that Mr Assange is still linked to WikiLeaks and therefore involved in interfering in internal affairs of other states.\" His accusations against Assange also included blocking security cameras at the embassy, accessing security files and confronting guards. Mr Moreno said the British government had confirmed in writing that Assange \"would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty\". The arrest comes a day after Wikileaks said it had uncovered an extensive spying operation against its co-founder at the Ecuadorian embassy. There has been a long-running dispute between the Ecuadorian authorities and Assange about what he was and was not allowed to do in the embassy. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that over the years they had removed his access to the internet and accused him of engaging in political activities - which is not allowed when claiming asylum. He said: \"Precisely what has happened in the embassy is not clear - there has been claim and counter claim.\" How have people reacted? Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: \"This goes to show that in the UK, no one is above the law.\" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of \"years of careful diplomacy\" and that it was \"not acceptable\" for someone to \"escape facing justice\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition \"should be opposed by the British government\". Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders said that the UK should resist extradition, because it would \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future\". Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said he would continue to receive \"the usual consular support\" and that consular officers will try to visit him. And actress Pamela Anderson, who has visited the embassy to support Assange, said the arrest was a \"vile injustice\".

It did not specify which organisations had been targeted, or whether any information had been stolen. But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers. Russia has denied responsibility. \"We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain. We can say one thing - Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts,\" said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, according to the Tass news agency. The warning was published by an international group of security services: One expert said it was \"plausible\" that, despite the Kremlin's denials, Russian spies were involved. \"The received wisdom is that in cyber-space, attribution is difficult but not impossible,\" commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank. \"Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt. \"Cozy Bear [the named group] has been implicated in past cyber-attacks and has left quite a trail, and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself.\" In recent years, Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them. But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about \"state-backed hackers\" or using other more cautious references. And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive - coronavirus vaccine research - rather than simply some company or government department's information. However, on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim. Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others, including Western spies, are likely to be active in this space. The UK, US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems, and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines. They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spear-phishing attacks. But one cyber-security expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign. \"They have lots of people, we have lots of people, the Americans have even more people, as do the Chinese,\" commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory. \"They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time.\" Who is accused of being responsible? The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear. It says it is more than 95% certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services. Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant \"threat actor\" in 2014, according to the American cyber-security firm Crowdstrike. It describes the group as being \"aggressive\" in its tactics and \"nothing if not flexible, changing tool sets frequently\". The unit has previously been implicated in hacking the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the US Presidential election in 2016. In 2017, it attacked Norway's Labour Party, defence and foreign ministries, as well as the country's national security service. The report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyber-attacks. \"Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines,\" it said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. \"While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.\" On Thursday, the UK government also said Russians had \"almost certainly\" sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly-acquired documents. \"We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe,\" said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, \"and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities.\" What else has the US said? by Tara McKelvey in Washington DC \"The National Security Agency, along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cyber-security advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,\" said NSA cyber-security director Anne Neuberger. Earlier in 2020, John Demers, an assistant attorney general for US national security, warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research. He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a \"significant geopolitical success story\". For that reason, hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries. Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely. Now, intelligence experts know more about the goals of the hackers and how they using spear-phishing and malware to get what they want.", "summary": "有安全机构发出警告，指有俄罗斯间谍正以英国、美国和加拿大等国的新型冠状病毒疫苗机构为目标进行情报工作。"}

The carmaker said that there was \"no evidence\" that Autopilot was responsible. It follows an investigation into a fatal accident in Florida where the focus is on the apparent failure of Tesla's technology. In the incident in Pennsylvania, the Model X car hit a guard rail and veered into the eastbound lane, ending up on its roof. In a statement, Tesla said: \"Based on the information we have now, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident.\" It said that it had received an automated alert from the car indicating airbags had been deployed but never received logs containing details about the state of vehicle controls, which would indicate whether Autopilot was on or off. Autopilot is a feature which allows cars to automatically change lanes and react to traffic. US car safety regulators are scrutinising the Pennsylvania crash to determine whether the Autopilot system was in use at the time. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a report last week following the death of 40-year-old Joshua Brown, who was killed while driving a Tesla in Florida. It concluded that both the driver and the Autopilot system failed to detect a large tractor-trailer turning left in front of him. In response to that, Tesla reiterated the safety record for its vehicles and the fact that the Autopilot feature is an auto-assist rather than autonomous feature - which means the driver needs to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The NHTSA is due to issue guidelines around the rules for autonomous car technology later this month. Previously NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind has said that technology such as Autopilot needed to be twice as safe as the manual systems they replace.", "summary": "美国有关当局正在对拥有自驾功能的特斯拉汽车涉及的一起车祸展开调查，这也是特斯拉汽车第二次因车祸受到调查。"}

To date, there have been 44,830 official deaths in the UK, but this has slowed with 1,100 in July. The estimate does not take into account any lockdowns, treatments or vaccines. And the scientists say: \"The risk... could be reduced if we take action immediately\". The report, requested by the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, stresses there is still a high degree of uncertainty over how the coronavirus pandemic will play out this winter. But research suggests the virus can survive longer in colder conditions and is more likely to spread when people spend more time indoors. And experts are concerned the NHS will be under extreme pressure, not just from a resurgence of coronavirus but also from seasonal flu and a backlog of regular, non-coronavirus workload. The health service is already severely disrupted in the aftermath of the first pandemic wave, with a waiting list that could stand at 10 million by the end of this year, the report says. Prof Stephen Holgate, a respiratory specialist from University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, who chaired the report, said: \"This is not a prediction - but it is a possibility. \"The modelling suggests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this winter. \"But the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately.\" With relatively low numbers of coronavirus cases at the moment, \"this is a critical window of opportunity to help us prepare for the worst that winter can throw at us\", he added. Less pessimistic winter scenarios are also possible, with coronavirus deaths in the thousands. The report makes it clear there is a high degree of uncertainty in the projected death figures. It is not a prediction of what will happen, rather what might. Researchers can model likely scenarios. But simulations rest on assumptions that do not always play out in real life. Change any of the parameters slightly, and you get very different projections. The overall message, however, is clear - prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Currently, coronavirus deaths and cases in the UK are down, which gives the nation a chance to reflect and plan for a second wave. Keeping infection rates low as Britain emerges from lockdown will be critical in controlling the disease. The virus has not gone away. And we do not have a vaccine for it yet. But there are things we can all do, including isolating and getting tested if we develop symptoms. Co-author Prof Dame Anne Johnson, from the Academy of Medical Sciences, said: \"Faced with these potential challenges, and after an already tough year, it would be easy to feel hopeless and powerless. \"But this report shows that we can act now to change things for the better.\" It recommends: Health Secretary Matt Hancock said planning was already under way for dealing with the expected surge in demand on the NHS this winter. The government had procured enough flu vaccine to roll out the \"biggest flu vaccine programme in history\" and was working on setting up a coronavirus vaccination programme should a successful vaccine be found, he added. A government statement said: \"We remain vigilant and the government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to avoid a second peak that would overwhelm our NHS.\"", "summary": "英国科学家警告，如果不做好防疫措施，今年冬天爆发第二波感染的话，可能会有12万人死于新冠病毒疾病。"}

But prosecutors and the judge noted that US charges are never ordinarily released until after an arrest. Prosecutors did not confirm or deny any such charge sheet against Mr Assange. Barry Pollack, a US lawyer representing Mr Assange, told the BBC he is unaware of the nature of such a criminal complaint. In a federal court on Tuesday in Alexandria, Virginia, Judge Leonie Brinkema called it \"an interesting case, to say the least\", according to US media. She said she would make a ruling at a later date after receiving more information. Lawyers for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which filed the motion to unseal, said that since Mr Assange knows he has been charged, there is no rationale for keeping the criminal complaint sealed. But Assistant US Attorney Gordon Kromberg said that in any legal case, \"discussion of why it would be sealed cannot be done in a public forum\", the Washington Post reported. The purported criminal complaint emerged earlier this month when papers from the Eastern District of Virginia federal court stated \"Assange has been charged\", though he was not listed as a defendant in that case. A spokesman for the US attorney's office told the New York Times the filing was \"made in error\". On 16 November, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed its motion requesting Judge Brinkema unseal the complaint against Mr Assange. Its director, Bruce Brown, said in a statement: \"There's no longer any justification for keeping the criminal complaint, the docket, and other filings related to the prosecution sealed.\" Although prosecutors have said an erroneous reference was not proof of any actual charges, several US media outlets have cited sources as confirming there is a sealed complaint against Mr Assange. On Tuesday, the Guardian reported that Mr Assange had met former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort several times before the 2016 US election. US investigators are scrutinising whether the Trump campaign was aware of Wikileaks' role in the leaking of Democratic emails that were allegedly stolen by Russian hackers during the American presidential race two years ago. Mr Manafort swiftly denied the Guardian report. \"This story is totally false and deliberately libellous,\" said a statement issued through his spokesman. \"I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him.\" Wikileaks also denied on Twitter that any such meetings had taken place. Mr Manafort was convicted of financial fraud earlier this year as a part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. On Monday, the Mueller team said the former aide had breached his plea deal by repeatedly lying to the FBI. CNN reports that Mr Mueller is also investigating whether Wikileaks or Mr Assange were discussed during a 2017 meeting between Mr Manafort and Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno. Mr Assange took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2012 amid fears he could be prosecuted for Wikileaks' previous revelations of US national security secrets. Friction between Mr Assange and the diplomatic staff is known to have risen. According to some reports, he has been asked by the embassy to begin paying his own living expenses from December and has to clean the bathroom.

Today, it houses one of Venezuela's most infamous jails, and embodies the country's decline from Latin American powerhouse to crisis zone. 'Instant modernity' El Helicoide was built in the 1950s, when Venezuela had big dreams - and big money from oil revenues to match. The post-World War Two boom was in full swing and dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez wanted to project an image of a forward-looking nation. \"There was real investment in this idea of instant modernity,\" says Dr Lisa Blackmore, co-author of \"Downward Spiral: El Helicoide's Descent from Mall to Prison\" and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Essex in the UK. \"[Venezuela] is a country that from 1948 entered a period of military dictatorship, and the mandate was: 'We will progress if we build.'\" El Helicoide was supposed to be world's first drive-thru shopping centre, with ramps spiralling upwards to the 300 planned boutiques in the complex. It was so big it could be seen from anywhere in the city of Caracas. \"This is an absolutely iconic building - there is really nothing like it in Latin America,\" Dr Blackmore says. But Perez Jimenez was overthrown in 1958 and this ambitious project became a white elephant. Place of fear For years the building stood largely empty, but in the 1980s the government started to transfer some state agencies to El Helicoide - the most important being its intelligence services, now known as SEBIN. Since then it's become a place of fear, used to detain both ordinary criminals and political prisoners. The BBC has spoken to former prisoners, their families, legal representatives, NGOs, and also to two former prison guards to build up a picture of life in El Helicoide. They have asked us to protect their identities because they fear government reprisals against their families. Rosmit Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in May 2014. He was one of more than 3,000 people arrested as huge anti-government protests rocked the country. Aged 32, he was already a well-known political activist and outspoken advocate of LGBT rights. During his incarceration he would also be elected to the Venezuelan National Assembly, becoming the country's first openly gay congressman. Economic and political turmoil Life in Venezuela was becoming increasingly difficult, with spiralling inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and public services nearing collapse. At El Helicoide, it was a chaotic time. Busloads of prisoners were arriving at the prison every day. Students, political activists, and sometimes people, including children, were swept up because they'd been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mantilla was accused of helping finance the protests - a charge he denies. Manuel is a former prison officer who remembers Mantilla well. \"[He] was one of those detainees who should never have been there,\" Manuel remembers. 'Make people afraid' The former officer told the BBC: \"By arresting a lot of people, the aim was to make people afraid.\" \"And I think they did, in a way. Because nowadays, when there is a demonstration or a march, many Venezuelans are afraid because they don't want to be arrested.\" Prisoners in El Helicoide wait days, weeks, even months to appear before a tribunal. Manuel said: \"SEBIN is an institution whose mission is to produce intelligence and information. But for a while that has not been its role. Its role is to defend a regime, a dictatorship.\" During his two-and-a-half year nightmare, Mantilla says he was afraid all the time. But he felt driven to document the torture and cruelty which happened on a daily basis in El Helicoide. 'Guantanamo' When Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in 2014, he recalls there were just 50 detainees. Two years later, he says, there were 300. As the number of detainees rose, the guards had to improvise to find more space. Offices, toilets, staircases and spaces once meant to be exclusive boutiques were sealed off and converted into cells. The prisoners had names for them - the Fish Tank, Little Tiger and Little Hell. But the worst of all was Guantanamo. \"It was an old evidence storeroom,\" remembers Victor, another former prison officer at El Helicoide. \"It was about 12 x 12 metres and it was used to hold around 50 prisoners.\" It was hot, cramped and airless. \"No light, no water, no toilet, without sanitation and without beds,\" says Mantilla. \"The walls were stained with blood and excrement.\" He told the BBC that prisoners could spend weeks there without showering, urinating in plastic bottles and defecating in plastic bags - which they'd refer to as 'little ships'. Systematic torture But mistreatment is not the only fear associated with El Helicoide. All the former prisoners and guards who have spoken to the BBC about their experiences have described the systematic use of torture by the SEBIN to obtain confessions. Carlos, a former detainee, told the BBC: \"They covered my head with a bag. I was badly beaten, kicked and subjected to electric shocks to my head, testicles and stomach.\" \"I felt immense humiliation, impotence, shame and indignation.\" Another detainee, Luis, said: \"My head was covered but I heard one SEBIN officer saying: \"Let's get the gun. We are going to kill you.\" \"They were laughing. \"There's one bullet. Let's see if you're lucky.\" I could feel the pistol against my head… and hear them pulling the trigger. It happened many times.\" Mantilla says he began to collect prisoners' stories and found the same brutal methods used over and over again. \"There was a university student who had a plastic bag full of human excrement forced over his head so he had to breathe it in,\" he told the BBC. \"I heard about people raped with blunt objects, others given electric shocks, and some were blindfolded for days until they would lose consciousness.\" Human rights abuses Both former guards who spoke to the BBC denied ever participating in torture themselves, but both say they had seen it happening. \"I saw people being beaten, tied up, suspended from a stair rail by their wrists with their feet barely touching the ground,\" says Victor. \"They used a battery charger with two wires connected to the detainees through their skin to give them electric shocks,\" says Manuel. \"[Torture] was systematic,\" he adds. \"It was seen as normal.\" Many of these cases have been documented by international human rights organisations, and in February 2018 the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary examination into crimes and human rights violations committed during the protests. Venezuela has said that it will cooperate with the investigation. Left to die In October 2016, after spending two-and-a-half years in El Helicoide, Mantilla became so seriously ill that the prison authorities decided to transfer him to a clinic to undergo surgery. The procedure was authorised by a judge, but at the last moment the SEBIN intervened. Still in chronic pain, Mantilla was dragged out of the clinic and forcibly returned to El Helicoide, where he was thrown into an isolation cell. \"It was like having a terminal disease and being locked in a room and told you will never be released. They were sentencing me to death.\" Video footage posted on the internet of Mantilla shouting defiantly as he was pushed into a SEBIN vehicle outside the clinic caused an outcry both at home and abroad. International humanitarian organisations led calls for his release. After ten days, the authorities bowed to pressure and Mantilla was transferred first to a military hospital, then to a clinic where he finally had the operation he needed. He was formally released from detention in November 2016, and within days was sworn in as a congressman - then he began testifying about what he had seen and experienced in El Helicoide. \"Crimes against humanity do not have an expiration date [statute of limitations],\" he says. Exile But Mantilla never felt safe after his release, and in July 2017, he left Venezuela and moved to France. He was granted asylum in May 2018. From his new home he still follows events in Venezuela closely, and hopes to return one day. His time in El Helicoide continues to cast a long shadow on his life. \"I never was the same person [afterwards]… It is complicated because somehow El Helicoide was my home for two and a half years. Although I try to deny it, a lot of me remains inside there.\" Manuel and Victor have also both left Venezuela and are living abroad. In May 2018, prisoners in El Helicoide rioted in protest at the conditions. A number of detainees were released and promises were made to improve conditions. But according to accounts from those who have been inside the prison, not much has been done to improve the conditions in El Helicoide. The BBC repeatedly contacted the Venezuelan authorities and put the allegations about El Helicoide to them. Despite repeated attempts to contact officials in the Ministry of Communications based in Caracas and to the representatives of the Venezuelan government in the UK the BBC has not received a response to these requests.

A Brazilian security source told the news agency that the documents - which were issued by the Brazilian embassy in the Czech capital, Prague in 1996 - appeared to be genuine. Other security sources said the documents had been used to apply for visas to visit Western countries, but could not confirm whether the visas had been issued or used. But why would North Korea's ruling family need fake documents? And why Brazil? Did this really happen? These copies may not constitute conclusive proof, but it's not the first time Brazilian passports have been linked to the Kim family. In 2011, Japanese media quoted officials as saying Kim Jong-un and his brother Jong-chul had entered the country to visit Tokyo Disneyland on Brazilian documents as far back as 1991. Jong-un's older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, is said to have fallen out of favour with their father in 2001 after he was caught trying to sneak into Japan using a false Dominican passport - apparently also on his way to Disneyland. Obtaining passports fraudulently doesn't seem to have been much of a problem for the Kims. But why would they need such passports? It was a cold world for North Korea in the 1990s. Its main backer, the Soviet Union, was now a fragment of history. Internally the country was being ravaged by shortages and famine, while internationally it was a pariah state - with billions of dollars of outstanding external debt. In the post-Cold War world of diplomacy, North Korea's friends were dwindling in number, making its passport of limited use. Its secretive first family would also probably have preferred to remain under the radar. Nonetheless, Dr John Nilsson-Wright, North Korea expert at UK security think-tank Chatham House, does find it surprising that Kim Jong-il - then only two years into his leadership - would have considered travelling abroad under a false passport. \"Why would he want to do that? Kim Jong-il was seen as being very risk-averse - we know that he had visited Moscow and Beijing on a number of occasions, but for that he probably wouldn't have needed a passport,\" Dr Nilsson-Wright told the BBC's Newshour programme. \"So it suggests that maybe this was an attempt by him and his son to think in terms of potentially an escape route out of North Korea - and that would be revealing and very surprising.\" It suggests, he says, \"that there was a degree of uncertainty - that the country was less secure than we might have thought\". But why a Brazilian passport - is it true to say it's the fraudsters' favourite? That's quite a common conception - that because of Brazil's diverse population, almost anyone on the planet could plausibly claim to be Brazilian and the passports are thus in high demand. A Brazilian official made such a claim to an al-Jazeera journalist in 2011. In fact, there isn't much data to suggest this assertion is currently valid. A survey by Vocativ in 2015 found Brazil did not feature in its list of the most expensive - and therefore most desirable - phoney passports available on the dark web (the criminal underbelly of the internet). Back in the 1990s, though, it was a different story. The Brazilian government itself concedes that before it introduced a raft of security features in 2006, the \"Brazilian passport was one of the most commonly faked\". The Kims could also easily pass as part of Brazil's large populations of East Asian origin. It's also interesting to note that the passport was issued in Brazil's embassy in the Czech Republic. Links - both economic and co-operative - were forged between North Korea and the then-Czechoslovakia during the period of frantic growth and rebuilding in North Korea following the devastating 1950-53 Korean War.", "summary": "最近有新证据显示，朝鲜领导人金正恩及其父亲金正日曾在90年代获取欺骗性巴西护照。"}

The body of Roshani Tiruwa was found by her father last weekend in a stone and mud hut in the village of Gajra, in Achham district, 440km (275 miles) west of Kathmandu.

They can be freezing cold in winter and stiflingly hot in summer. It is thought that many victims of the tradition suffer from mental and physical illnesses in later life. The chhaupadi rules mean that a menstruating female faces restrictions on where she can sleep, who she can see, where she is allowed to go and who she can touch. Critics say the government has not done enough to eradicate the practice and that it is has also been slow to prevent child marriages.

Tax investigation The magazine said the artworks were found by chance in early 2011, when the tax authorities investigated Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich. He was suspected of tax evasion, and investigators obtained a search warrant for his home in Munich. There, they found the cache of some 1,500 artworks which had vanished from sight during the Nazi era. The younger Mr Gurlitt had kept the works in darkened rooms and sold the occasional painting when he needed money, Focus reports. The Nazis categorised almost all modern art as \"degenerate\". It was banned for being un-German or for being the work of Jewish artists. Some works were confiscated or destroyed; others were sold to collectors for a low price. There are international warrants out for at least 200 of the works, Focus reports. The collection is being held in a secure warehouse in Munich for the time being. One of the pieces is said to be a portrait of a woman by Matisse which belonged to the grandfather of French TV presenter Anne Sinclair.

The British Heart Foundation, which funded The Lancet work, says the UK must clean up its air - many of its cities often exceed safe levels set by the European Union. The government has already admitted that in 15 regions, air quality will breach EU limits until 2020. But Defra says it is committed to improving air quality and that most parts of the UK meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants. Air pollution, largely from traffic fumes, has previously been linked to heart attacks but not heart failure. This happens when the heart muscle becomes weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. It is often the consequence of a heart attack and affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. Deep into lungs The Lancet research looked at 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including the UK, the US and China. The strongest link was found with gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as fine particulate air pollution - fumes from buses, taxis and lorries that can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. People with already weakened hearts who were exposed to high levels, by living near to or travelling along busy roads, for example, were particularly susceptible. And the increased risk seems to be strongest on the day of exposure. Dr Anoop Shah and colleagues who carried out the work say moderate reductions in air pollution could avoid 8,000 US hospital admissions for heart failure each year. \"There's no reason why the impact wouldn't be similar in the UK.\" Alan Andrews of the lobby group Client Earth said: \"The UK has a big problem with air pollution, particularly from road traffic, and the government response sadly has been worse than useless.\" He said people should be alerted when pollution levels are high so that they can take measures to protect themselves, by staying indoors when possible and avoiding busy roads. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year. UK estimates suggest nearly 30,000 people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases, including cancer, as well as heart problems. The Chief Medical Officer recently highlighted the impact of air pollution in her first annual report on the state of the nation's health - air pollution was highlighted among the top 10 causes of mortality in the UK.", "summary": "一项大规模国际调查称，空气污染对心脏衰弱的人威胁最大，甚至可能导致死亡。"}

Relations had been strained by Australia's reported policy of turning back boats carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, as well as a spying row. Reports say Australia has intercepted another boat, angering Jakarta. Indonesia insists that sending back boatloads of asylum seekers, known as tow-backs, violates its sovereignty. 'Embarrassment' Mr Abbott had been expected to attend the Open Government Partnership conference in Bali, at the invitation of Indonesian leader Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, early next week. However, his spokesman told the Australian Associated Press (APP) on Friday that \"the attempt to make a trip to Indonesia has been postponed, but we are hopeful of finding another date soon\". No reason was given for the cancellation but Australian media said the decision was due to the current operation to turn back an asylum boat. An \"on-water operation\" was taking place that could cause \"embarrassment\" to Indonesia, ABC news said, citing government sources. The West Australian reported that customs officials were rushing to block an asylum boat spotted in Australian waters. Strained allies Indonesia's presidential spokesman Teuku Faizasyah told AAP he viewed Mr Abbott's decision as a \"notification he could not attend\" rather than a \"cancellation\". \"I think there's no disappointment from the Indonesian government,\" he said. But opposition Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said: \"It's very important the prime minister discloses the reason that he's really not going, because Australians deserve to know why he's putting further pressure on the relationship with such an important neighbour.\" Meanwhile, Greens leader Christine Milne said Mr Abbott's actions were \"an embarrassment\". Australia and Indonesia are key allies and trading partners. Canberra requires Indonesia's co-operation on its asylum policy, but tensions rose after Australian navy vessels were widely reported to be turning asylum boats back to Indonesia. Indonesia has described the approach as unhelpful, while the UN refugee agency says such tow-backs may breach international law. The government has refused to comment on these reports, citing operational sensitivities. In April, Australia apologised after admitting that its navy violated Indonesia's territorial waters during operations to prevent asylum boats reaching Australian waters.

The findings, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, will be used to improve trials for new dementia drugs. Experts warned that the test was not yet ready for doctors' surgeries. Research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease has been plagued by failure. Between 2002 and 2012, 99.6% of trials aimed at preventing or reversing the disease flopped. Doctors believe the failure is down to treating patients when it is already too late, since symptoms appear around a decade after the start of the disease. Identifying patients earlier is one of the priorities for dementia research. Dementia across the globe Blood test The research group, which combines university and industry scientists, looked for differences in the blood of 452 healthy people, 220 with mild cognitive impairment and 476 with Alzheimer's disease. They were able to tell with 87% accuracy which patients with mild cognitive impairment would go on to develop Alzheimer's disease in the next year. \"We want to be able to identify people to enter clinical trials earlier than they currently do and that's really what we've been aiming at,\" said lead researcher Prof Simon Lovestone from the University of Oxford. However, he said it may find a place in doctors' surgeries in the future. \"As long as there is no treatment one can question the value of a test, but people come to the clinic because they want to know what's happening to them and I currently can't tell them.\" He said he was forced to tell patients to come back in a year and see if their memory problems were any worse. Prof Lovestone added: \"That's grim, it's horrible, you can only imagine what that's like for patients. \"Although I have some real reservations about doing a test, all I can say is there are some people who come to clinics asking precisely that question.\" Dr Ian Pike, chief operating officer at Proteome Sciences, said: \"Having a protein test is really a major step forwards. \"[It] will take several years and need many more patients before we can be certain these tests are suitable for routine clinical use, that process can start fairly quickly now.\" Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, described the study as a \"technical tour de force\". However, he warned the current accuracy levels risked telling healthy people they were on course to develop Alzheimer's which may lead to anxiety and depression. It is unlikely that the test would be used in isolation if it eventually makes its way into clinics. A positive result could be backed up by brain scans or testing spinal fluid for signs of Alzheimer's. However, Dr Karran did argue this was a step towards making Alzheimer's a preventable disease. \"I think it does, but not immediately. \"This gives a better way to identify people who will progress to Alzheimer's disease, people who can be entered into clinical trials earlier, I think that will increase the potential of a positive drug effect and thereby I think we will get to a therapy, which will be an absolute breakthrough if we can get there. \"It's not a simple journey.

The UK, France and Germany were the main movers behind the drive. The communique also said members would refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain economic advantage, amid fears of a new \"currency war\". The fears had been sparked by Japan's recent policies, which have driven down the value of the yen, aiding its exporters. 'Strongly determined' A recent survey carried out by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that multinational firms could exploit gaps between tax rules in the different countries in which they operate. The finance ministers of the UK, France and Germany - George Osborne, Pierre Moscovici and Wolfgang Schaeuble - said international action was needed to crack down on companies which transfer profits from their home country to another in order to pay lower taxes. Mr Osborne decried a global taxation system he said had been guided by principles set out by the League of Nations in the 1920s, with few changes since. He said: \"We want businesses to pay the taxes that we set in our countries. And that cannot be achieved by one country alone.\" Mr Moscovici said France was \"strongly determined to fight against tax fraud, tax avoidance, and tax evasion\". He added: \"We must avoid situations in which some companies use international and domestic law to be taxed nowhere.\" OECD secretary general Angel Gurria said laws had to be changed: \"Avoiding double taxation has become a way of having double non-taxation.\" The G20 communique read: \"We are determined to develop measures to address base erosion and profit shifting, take the necessary collective action and look forward to the comprehensive action plan the OECD will present to us in July.\" A number of companies, including Amazon, Google and Starbucks, have come under the spotlight for their taxation strategies in recent months. Another giant international company, Facebook, has now been accused of ducking its tax obligations. Facebook allegedly paid no corporate income tax in the US last year, and instead reclaimed $451m in taxes from the Internal Revenue Service, despite recording profits of over $1bn, US lobby group Citizens for Tax Justice has claimed. Thanks to tax deductions the social network can claim on shares granted to its executives as part of its recent listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, the company stands to benefit from a further $2bn of tax deductions in the future, the lobby group alleged. However, in Facebook's defence, the same employee share scheme that has allowed it to cut its corporate income tax bill has also resulted in it handing over $2.86bn in employee income taxes instead. Plan of action The report by the OECD was released earlier this year, and found that: The OECD action plan, to be laid before the G20 in July, will be formulated with the help of three committees. The UK will chair a committee looking at transfer pricing - how international corporate empires calculate the payments passed between their subsidiaries in different countries, which can be used to shift profits from high-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax ones. Germany will head a panel looking at the ways in which companies have reduced their tax base - their taxable income and assets - while France and the US will jointly consider the problem of identifying the correct tax jurisdiction for business activities, particularly e-commerce. 'Economic warfare' Meanwhile, the G20 finance ministers avoided singling Japan out for criticism over the recent weakness of its currency. But the communique pledged that G20 members would \"refrain from competitive devaluation\". It read: \"We reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. \"We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open.\" Mr Osborne said: \"Currencies should not be used as a tool of competitive devaluation. The world should not make the mistake that it has made in the past of using currencies as the tools of economic warfare.\" International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that global growth was still weak and unemployment \"outrageously high\" in many countries, and that policies should be directed towards creating jobs and growth.", "summary": "在莫斯科举行的20国集团财政部长会议发表声明，支持打击跨国偷税漏税计划。"}

Mr Tusk visited Greece and Turkey on Thursday to discuss ways to reduce the flow of migrants travelling west. More than 25,000 migrants have been left stranded in Greece by a tightening of border controls to the north, raising fears of a humanitarian crisis. On Thursday, a group of migrants blocked a railway line on the Greek side of the border with Macedonia to protest at the restrictions. They were imposed after several Balkan countries decided only to allow Syrian and Iraqi migrants across their frontiers. Austria also decided to limit numbers. The move effectively barred passage to thousands of people seeking to reach western Europe, including Afghans as well as some more likely to be regarded as economic migrants. Has the EU kept its promises? Crisis in seven charts Desperate migrants plead to flee 'hellish' camp Europe 'on cusp of self-induced crisis' After meeting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens on Thursday, Mr Tusk said he was appealing to \"all potential illegal economic migrants\", wherever they may be from. \"Do not come to Europe,\" he said. \"Do not believe the smugglers. Do not risk your lives and your money. It is all for nothing.\" He also said EU member states must avoid taking unilateral action to deal with the migrant crisis. Separately, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande discussed security and migration issues in the French city of Amiens, including conditions at the French port of Calais, where thousands of migrants hoping to enter the UK have been living rough. After the talks Mr Hollande warned of \"consequences\" for management of migrants heading to Britain if the UK voted to leave the European Union in a June referendum. Earlier, French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said his country could allow migrants to travel unchecked to the UK in the event of a so-called \"Brexit\". He told the Financial Times newspaper that an exit vote could end a bilateral deal allowing the UK to vet new arrivals on French territory. Authorities in Calais have been clearing part of a sprawling camp known as the Jungle, from where many migrants are trying to enter the UK illegally. Ahead of an EU-Turkey summit on the issue on Monday, Mr Tusk travelled to Turkey later on Thursday for talks with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Mr Davutoglu said that the flow of Syrian refugees would lessen if the cessation of hostilities in the conflict held, adding that violations by Syrian government and Russian forces had left it vulnerable. Analysis: Selin Girit, BBC News, Ankara Turkey already accommodates over 2.5 million Syrian refugees - at an estimated cost of €7 (£5.4bn). The EU has pledged €3bn to Turkey, which is calling for more support. Mr Davutoglu repeated that they expected the opening of new chapters for Turkey's longstanding EU membership bid and progress on visa-free travel to the EU for Turkish citizens. Turkey has already offered to sign readmission agreements with 14 countries, a move that could enable it to take back migrants rejected by the EU more efficiently. Turkish officials also say they have managed to prevent almost 25,000 migrants from travelling to Europe this year. But almost 130,000 have made their way to Greek islands during the same period. In the EU summit in Brussels next week, there will be calls on Turkey to do more to reduce the numbers of migrants. Mr Tusk said earlier this week that Europe was ready to grant \"substantial financial support\" to countries neighbouring war-torn regions such as Syria and Iraq. \"But at the same time we expect a more intensive engagement from our partners as an absolute precondition to avoid a humanitarian disaster,\" he said. Turkey has expressed frustration at the lack of a common position from the EU on the crisis. BBC Europe Correspondent Chris Morris, who is on the Greek island of Lesbos where 75,000 migrants have already arrived so far this year, says the EU wants to see arrivals in Greece drop below 1,000 a day. New figures suggest last year's total of one million seaborne migrants arriving in Europe could be matched well before the end of the year. The number of migrants stuck in Greece has soared, after Macedonia began restricting passage to all but a small number. More migrants are en route from Athens. Earlier this week, the European Commission adopted plans to distribute €700m (£543m; $760m) of emergency humanitarian funding between 2016-18 to help tackle the crisis. Greece has asked the European Commission for nearly €500m in assistance to help care for 100,000 asylum seekers. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said nearly 129,500 migrants had arrived in Europe by sea so far in 2016, plus another 1,545 by land. It said 418 had drowned or were missing. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "正在希腊访问的欧洲理事会主席图斯克星期四（3月3日）对他所称的“非法经济移民”发出警告，要求他们不要前往欧洲。"}

Processed meat has already been linked with cancer. What is processed meat? How much of a cancer risk is processed meat? Experts say people should eat no more than 70g a day of red and processed meat for good health. That's about one sausage plus a rasher of bacon a day. Meat wheeze The people in the study had been taking part in a French survey about food and health, spanning a decade from 2003 to 2013. Around half of them were asthma patients. The rest - the control subjects - had no history of the condition. The survey looked specifically at asthma symptoms - breathlessness, wheeze, chest tightness - and intake of cured meat: a single portion was two slices of ham, one sausage or two slices of salami. Among the people with asthma, higher meat consumption was linked with a worsening of their lung symptoms. People who said they consumed more than four portions a week - eight slices of ham or four sausages, for example - had the biggest deterioration of their asthma by the end of the study. The experts stress that their work cannot prove diet is definitely to blame. There are lots of factors in a person's life that can make their asthma worse. The researchers tried to eliminate the most obvious ones, controlling for things like obesity, and the link between processed meat and worsening asthma remained. Dr Erika Kennington, Head of Research at Asthma UK says: \"Although certain foods can be triggers for allergies in some people, there is no specific dietary advice to manage asthma symptoms generally. For most people with asthma, healthy eating advice is exactly the same as it is for everyone else: follow a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh and unprocessed food and is low in sugar, salt and saturated fat.\" Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association recommended \"a varied and Mediterranean-style diet\", containing plenty of fresh produce, \"whether you have asthma or not.\"", "summary": "研究人员说，经常吃加工肉食品可能会使哮喘病加重。"}

Zoe Shields, Bury, UK I am totally shocked and devastated at this sad news. I have always been a huge fan but never saw him live in his heyday. However, I feel so honoured that I managed to see him a few years back when the toured the UK, at the Manchester Arena. For me, he is the best live performer I have ever seen or am probably likely to ever see again. He was a true innovator, a creative genius, a pioneer. Rest in peace Prince. Ishbel Lovell, Edinburgh I saw Prince, one of my all time musical heroes, at Earl's Court, when I was living and working in London in the 1980s. It was one of the best periods of my life and seeing him in concert, with my best friend, was one of the absolute highlights of my whole life. Such wonderful memories. I can remember the whole day so well. And to top it off, we went to The Hippodrome after the concert and who was there? The man himself! Happy happy days. Laila Barker, Vancouver, Canada I saw Prince perform at GM Place here in Vancouver in May 2013. It was by far one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. He played on for hours and it was non-stop. His energy was astounding and to top it off he had a purple velvet grand piano. It was an experience I will never forget. I can't believe I didn't take a photo. I was so enamoured with the concert, it never occurred to me. I did wear an amazing velvet jacket in his honour though. We go to almost every major concert in town and this was easily in the top three. His presence will definitely be missed. Rob Dore, Highcliffe, England Another sad loss of a musical genius. Such a multi-talented writer and performer who contributed so much to the fame of many other artists through his writing prowess. I had the pleasure of seeing him perform live at Wembley three times. Another sad sad day for music. As Don McLean said: \"The day the music died.\"", "summary": "美国歌星“王子”(Prince)在明尼苏达家中去世，终年57岁。"}

Mr Straw said he had fallen into a \"very skilful trap\" while Sir Malcolm said his comments had been \"silly\". The MPs have referred themselves to Parliament's standards watchdog. Labour leader Ed Miliband has written to Prime Minister calling for a ban on MPs having second jobs. 'Useful access' It is claimed that Mr Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him £60,000 a year. On the subject of payment, Mr Straw is heard saying: \"So normally, if I'm doing a speech or something, it's £5,000 a day, that's what I charge.\" Sir Malcolm is reported to have claimed he could arrange \"useful access\" to every British ambassador in the world. The Conservative MP for Kensington and chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee was recorded saying: \"I am self-employed - so nobody pays me a salary. I have to earn my income.\" He said his usual fee for half a day's work was \"somewhere in the region of £5,000 to £8,000\". Analysis By Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent Jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind have both referred themselves to Parliament's commissioner for standards. A full investigation could take months. But there the similarities end. Mr Straw has been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party at his own request. Ed Miliband is unlikely to feel much sympathy for the retiring MP. Sir Malcolm is not facing any suspension. He told me the allegations had no bearing on his very significant role as chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees the work of MI5 and MI6. Downing Street has not offered any view on that. A source said it is for the Commons and other members of that committee to decide. Both men defended themselves on appearances on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday morning. Sir Malcolm said he had \"nothing to be embarrassed about\". He said the allegations were \"unfounded\" and he vowed to fight them \"with all my strength\". He said he had never accepted an offer from the fake firm, saying it was a \"preliminary\" discussion \"about what they had mind\". Sir Malcolm is paid £67,000 a year and he said telling the company he was not paid a salary was a \"silly thing to say\". \"Of course I receive a salary as a Member of Parliament but I was referring to my business interests, from none of which I receive a salary. I receive payment for services I provide,\" he said. MPs' second jobs About 200 MPs have business interests, he said, and everything he earns is detailed in the Register of Members' Interests. Sir Malcolm is due to meet the Conservative chief whip later on Monday. He said he would not stand down as security committee chairman, unless his committee colleagues wanted him to. \"One's got nothing to do with the other,\" he said. \"None of the matters are remotely to do with intelligence or security.\" He said he had a letter from Channel 4, accepting he had not offered access to any privileged or secret information. Mr Straw has suspended himself from the Parliamentary Labour Party, and the party said it was aware of the \"disturbing allegations\" against him. The Blackburn MP, who had already announced his intention to stand down in May, said he was \"mortified\" that he had fallen into the reporters' \"trap\" but that he had said nothing \"improper\". He told Today the language he used had been \"not necessarily wrong but could be taken out of context\". Advisory board During his 36 years as an MP he had been \"absolutely scrupulous\" about observing the rules, he said, adding that the entire discussion had been around what he would do after leaving Parliament. He acknowledged he should have postponed the conversation until after 7 May. Earlier, Mr Straw said he had taken on one consultancy role since his ministerial career ended in 2010, with commodity suppliers, ED&F Man (Holdings) Ltd, saying it was done in accordance with the MPs' Code of Conduct. Sir Malcolm and Mr Straw both said they had requested copies of the recording transcripts, but that Channel 4 and the Telegraph had not provided them. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair offered Mr Straw his support, saying he was a \"byword for being a hard-working constituency MP and parliamentarian\". Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said her party would \"end second jobs for MPs\". The undercover reporters had created a fictitious communications agency called PMR, which they said was based in Hong Kong. A statement on Channel 4's website said 12 MPs with \"significant outside interests\" were invited to apply for jobs with PMR, which had \"plenty of money\" and wanted to hire \"influential British politicians to join its advisory board\". \"Not all politicians are for hire,\" the statement added. \"Half of those approached didn't respond. One said he wanted to check us out in Hong Kong so we took it no further. And another said he just wasn't that interested.

The report said China had not made an official proposal, but its possibility had been discussed at \"the highest levels\" in the US and Australia. Vanuatu said it was not interested in hosting foreign military bases. \"No-one in the Vanuatu government has ever talked about a Chinese military base in Vanuatu of any sort,\" Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"We are a non-aligned country. We are not interested in militarisation.\" The newspaper report has sparked discussion in Australia, which sits 2,000km (1,240 miles) from Vanuatu, about possible efforts by China to exert influence in the South Pacific. China has not commented on the report. It set up its only overseas military base in Djibouti last year. What is China's relationship with Vanuatu? Vanuatu, a string of more than 80 islands sitting between Fiji and New Caledonia, has previously backed Beijing's position on the South China Sea. Home to about 250,000 people, the South Pacific nation has faced challenges including poverty and extreme weather events. Fairfax Media reported that Beijing had given the nation \"hundreds of millions of dollars in development money\", and has vowed to build or upgrade three Vanuatu government buildings. What did the report say? The newspaper said that China was likely to seek an initial access agreement that would allow its ships to be serviced and restocked in Vanuatu. Beijing could then expand its presence over time, Fairfax Media said, attributing its information to multiple anonymous sources. The report said officials in Washington and Canberra had discussed the issue, but it did not give details. What did Vanuatu say? In rejecting the report, Mr Regenvanu said he was \"not very happy about the standard of reporting in the Australian media\". \"I would hope the upsurge in the paranoia about China in Australia is not used to destroy or denigrate the good relationship Vanuatu has with Australia,\" he said. How have other nations responded? Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she was confident that her nation remained \"Vanuatu's strategic partner of choice\". However, she acknowledged that Beijing appeared to be increasing its activity in the Pacific. \"Chinese vessels visited Vanuatu last year as part of a broader visit to the region, but these sorts of visits are normal for many neighbours around the world,\" she said. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation was \"opposed to the militarisation of the South Pacific generally\". Who has raised concerns? Despite Vanuatu's denial, security experts say it is feasible that China could attempt to build a military base in a nation such as Vanuatu. Such a move would challenge the influence of the US and its allies Australia and New Zealand, according to Asia-Pacific expert Bates Gill. \"Those relationships as well as the US Navy itself has been the most dominant military and security power in the region for some 70 years,\" Prof Gill, from Sydney's Macquarie University, told the BBC. \"[China] is beginning to shift this long-standing regional dynamic in ways that are causing concern in Canberra and in other regional capitals.\"", "summary": "瓦努阿图否认与北京举行会谈，商讨在其领土上建立军事基地。"}

Mr Strayer warned again that allowing Huawei in would threaten intelligence sharing between the US and UK. \"If countries adopt untrustworthy vendors in 5G technology, it will jeopardise our ability to share information at the highest levels.\" The diplomat has been on a tour of Europe this week, reinforcing the Trump administration's message that Huawei has close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and poses a security threat. Speaking from Madrid, he said he had been telling European politicians that allowing in a high-risk firm like Huawei could let China \"undermine the critical infrastructure riding on 5G networks as well as exfiltrate sensitive data.\" Meanwhile, the White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was in Downing Street on Thursday meeting officials including Dominic Cummings to increase the pressure on Boris Johnson's government. The meeting was described as \"constructive\" and \"lengthy\", but afterwards a spokesperson said the UK government's position on the rollout of 5G had not changed since it was outlined in January. Just a mile or so away at London's Dorchester Hotel, Huawei was holding a lavish event where it trumpeted its success in winning 5G contracts and claimed that its equipment was more advanced than that of its rivals. The controversial Chinese firm revealed that it had won 91 5G contracts, up from 65 in December. 47 of Huawei's commercial 5G customers are in Europe, despite the pressure on operators by the US to steer clear of the company. The other big players in 5G equipment in Europe are Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, while in the United States the South Korean giant Samsung is also a major supplier. But in an interview with the BBC, Paul Scanlan, chief technology officer of Huawei's carrier business group, said he was confident that his company's equipment was in the lead, both in sales and in its technical standards. \"Somewhere between one and two or more years ahead of the others,\" was what he said his customers told him. He claimed that Huawei's spending on research and development had given it that lead. As an example, he explained that Huawei's founder Ren Zheng Fei had told his R&D team they must reduce the weight of their 5G radio equipment from 45kg to 25kg so that it could be installed without a crane. I put it to Mr Scanlan that the United States had accused Huawei of building its dominant position in the market by encouraging staff to steal other companies' intellectual property. \"I read that in the newspaper,\" he replied. \"And just because somebody says that doesn't make it the truth.\" Robert Strayer does not believe that Huawei has a lead over its rivals when it comes to the quality of its technology. \"They have engaged in a propaganda campaign to make people around the world think that they are the only alternative. It is simply not true,\" he said. \"Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung provide an equivalent quality in their product and don't put individuals' information and business information at risk.\" The diplomat insisted that the United States would keep talking to the UK about this issue and said he was confident that they would find a way forward.

The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. \"If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride,\" he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. \"Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission,\" according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Poverty Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: \"You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million,\" he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of \"Head of the Solar System\" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. \"The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration,\" Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Big business Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. \"Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction \" he told BBC News. \"What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations\". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. \"India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up,\" says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter", "summary": "印度即将发射的火星探测器将加速亚洲的太空竞赛。"}

We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy.\" 'Cinderella causes' The Queen has said she \"supports\" her grandchildren commemorating Princess Diana. Royal historian Kate Williams told the BBC it was an opportunity for the princes to \"put their stamp\" on their mother's legacy as \"a great charitable patron\". \"The princes have really taken up her mantle of the charity work - particularly of looking at the Cinderella causes, that don't get that much attention,\" she added. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris, when the Duke of Cambridge was 15 and his brother was 12. The princes' statue will be the fourth London-based monument dedicated to Princess Diana, and will be close to the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the memorial garden close to Kensington Palace. An artist will be chosen by a committee of six people, which includes Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale. Camilla Tominey, royal editor of the Sunday Express, said: \"This is Harry and William saying that want a more permanent and personal memorial to their mother. They were too young when she died to have any role in the memorial.\" She added: \"There's a sense that people want to go somewhere and pay their respects two decades on.\" 'A long time coming' By Peter Hunt, royal correspondent This national monument to the wife of one future king and the mother of another has been a long time coming. The Queen Mother statue was unveiled seven years after her death. Some of Diana's friends have argued it would be difficult to capture the princess in stone. Others have questioned whether the failure to do so was more a reflection of establishment ambivalence towards what Diana represented. Until now, the main memorial has been a fountain in London's Hyde Park. For its supporters, the granite structure embodies the princess's spontaneity. Its critics have likened it to the outflow from a power station. As children, Prince William and Prince Harry watched as controversy surrounded the building of this fountain.

Speaking on Friday, temporary Chief Constable Dee Collins said a 77-year-old man remains in a stable condition in hospital after he was injured when he \"bravely intervened\" in an effort to help the mother of two. Vigils were held across the country on Friday evening as members of the public and politicians came together to lay flowers, light candles and stand in silence in memory of Mrs Cox. Speaking earlier the Anglican Bishop of Huddersfield, the Right Reverend Dr Jonathan Gibbs, said there was a \"deep sense of sadness\" in the community. \"I think also people are beginning to reflect on these events,\" he said. \"Of course there's great anger that Jo's life should have been taken in this dreadful way, but there's also a sense of reflection on what does this say about our current political culture?\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the whole nation was \"rightly shocked\" at her death and called for people to \"value, and see as precious, the democracy we have on these islands\". Politics is about public service and MPs want to \"make the world a better place\", he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the former aid worker as \"an exceptional, wonderful, very talented woman....

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Twitter the killing was an attack on the democratic ideal. The Remain and Vote Leave sides have suspended national campaigning in light of Mrs Cox's death, while the Prime Minster confirmed Parliament would be recalled on Monday.

The US has recorded over 555,000 virus cases and 22,000 deaths so far. President Donald Trump later signalled his disproval with the interview by sharing a tweet about firing Dr Fauci. Dr Fauci has become the public face of the US fight against the outbreak, appearing alongside Mr Trump at the White House's daily updates. But the two have openly differed on several issues, Mr Fauci pointing out in a recent CBS interview that he takes a scientific approach while Mr Trump comes from a \"hope, layperson standpoint\". Mr Trump retweeted a post on Sunday from former Republican congressional hopeful Deanna Lorraine. \"Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large,\" it said. \"Time to #FireFauci...\" But the White House later denied that Mr Trump intended to fire him. \"This media chatter is ridiculous,\" a spokesman said. \"Dr Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser.\" The Trump administration has issued social distancing guidance that lasts until 30 April, but there are questions over when restrictions should be lifted. What did Mr Fauci say? When asked about a New York Times report that Dr Fauci and other officials had suggested aggressive mitigation towards the end of February, Dr Fauci said health officials could only make recommendations from a \"pure health standpoint\". \"Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it's not. But it is what it is, we are where we are right now.\" Dr Fauci, who is leading the US response to coronavirus, added that \"no one is going to deny\" that logically, earlier mitigation could have saved lives. But he said \"what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated\". \"There was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\" The top doctor also acknowledged that multiple factors were involved with the current situation in the US, such as the nation's size and heterogeneity, not just a later start on mitigation. But he also said parts of the nation might be able to begin a slow return to normalcy \"at least in some ways, maybe next month\". \"You don't want to do something precipitously,\" Dr Fauci emphasised, noting that ending virus containment efforts too hastily could lead to a rebound. \"It's going to be depending on where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak you already experienced and the threat of an outbreak you may not have experienced.\" Dr Fauci was also hopeful that the US presidential election, slated for 3 November, would still take place - if the nation takes a measured approach to lessening restrictions. The president's retweet, seen as a signal of his frustration with Dr Fauci, came alongside other tweets from him criticising the media over its coverage of his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak. In recent days the president has also been critical of the World Health Organization, as he continues to face mounting pressure over both the outbreak and the severe economic disruption it is causing. What's the situation in New York? New York has become the epicentre of the fight against coronavirus in the US. The state has almost 190,000 cases and has seen more than 10,000 deaths - among the highest rates in the world. During a briefing on Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he wanted his state to open \"as soon as possible\". But the governor was cautious, saying there had to be a co-ordinated approach between neighbouring states, more testing availability and additional federal funding. Mr Cuomo was also sceptical of any forecasting, saying: \"Every informed projection by experts, by the way, has not turned out correct.\" That was good news, he noted, as it meant policies and social compliance had made a difference in the last few weeks. \"I've said from day one - all these predictions, we're gonna open businesses in May, do this in May, do this in June - I think that's all premature. I don't think anybody can make an informed decision right now.\" Mr Cuomo said the number of deaths were stabilising, albeit at a \"terribly high rate\" - 758 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours. The death toll has remained in the 700s for the last few days. Will US restrictions be loosened? The White House remains keen to ease social distancing guidelines, and 1 May is a target date, according to food and drug agency commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn. Dr Hahn told ABC News on Sunday, \"We see light at the end of the tunnel.\" The decision to change restrictions would be ultimately driven by safety and welfare considerations, he added. Experts, including Dr Hahn, say increasing testing will be key to reopening the country, though Mr Trump has minimised the need for widespread testing. New York's Mr Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy have both called for more tests to stay ahead of the virus. On Sunday, Mr Cuomo announced an executive order calling for more antibody testing in order to determine who might have Covid-19 immunity and could return to work. The questions over when the US might relax its containment efforts come as the states continue to grapple with the spread of the virus. White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere announced President Donald Trump had issued a major disaster declaration for Wyoming on Saturday, meaning all 50 states have those declarations in effect for the first time in history.

The amount was less than the foundation had claimed. It had originally sought as much as $862m. The sum was lower in part because the judge ruled that Apple had not wilfully infringed the patent.

Recruitment would be focused on \"capability development\" rather than \"personality traits\", he added. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit was announced by the government in September. Under the £500m initiative, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is set to recruit hundreds of reservists as computer experts to work alongside regular armed forces. The unit will defend national security by safeguarding computer networks and vital data, and it will also launch strikes in cyberspace if necessary. It is hoped the move will address the shortage of people with the technological skills and knowledge to protect corporations, the military, and government systems from cyber attacks. 'Civil liberties' The MoD said the recruitment, which started in early October, would target regular personnel leaving the armed forces, current and former reservists with the required skills, and civilians with the appropriate technological knowledge. When asked by Newsnight whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking, Lt Col White said: \"I think if they could get through the security process, then if they had that capability that we would like, then if the vetting authority was happy with that, why not? \"We're looking at capability development, rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits.\" Defence Secretary Philip Hammond unveiled plans for the cyber defence unit last month. Mr Hammond also told Newsnight he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be employed. \"Each individual case would be looked at on its merits,\" he said. \"The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out.\" But one former hacker told Newsnight the government had already undermined its chances of attracting talented individuals. Mustafa al-Bassam, now a computer science student at King's College London, was the youngest hacker in the Lulzsec group - which recently targeted organisations such as the FBI in the US and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) in a 50-day hacking campaign. He told the BBC that revelations by former US contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of mass surveillance carried out by intelligence agencies - including the US' National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ - had dissuaded him from using his cyber skills to protect UK national security. \"I can understand the need for a government to protect itself, but when you go ahead and stomp on everyone's civil liberties - as we've seen with all the mass surveillance stories that have been out over the past year - I think you can rest assured that you're going to repel talented people,\" he said. 'Industrial scale' attacks Dr David Day, a Sheffield Hallam University computer forensics expert who provided evidence for Mr Al-Bassam's conviction, told Newsnight it was a \"terrible shame\" someone convicted of malicious hacking would find it difficult to get a job in the industry. \"If they have those abilities and those skills, then some of the best talent we can't use,\" he said. Cyber attacks and crime have become more common in recent years. In July, it emerged Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber espionage operations a month against government or industry networks, GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban told the BBC business secrets were being stolen on an \"industrial scale\". And in a written statement in December last year, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said 93% of large corporations and 76% of small businesses had reported a cyber breach in 2012.

The Swedish Academy praised his work which \"with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary\". The 57-year-old is the first Chinese resident to win the prize. Chinese-born Gao Xingjian was honoured in 2000, but is a French citizen. Mo is the 109th recipient of the prestigious prize, won last year by Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer. Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - only given to living writers - is worth 8 million kronor (£741,000). \"He has such a unique way of writing. If you read half a page of Mo Yan you immediately recognise it as him,\" said Peter Englund, head of the Academy. He said Mo had been told of the award, adding: \"He was at home with his dad. He said he was overjoyed and terrified.\" Born Guan Moye, the author writes under the pen name Mo Yan, which means \"don't speak\" in Chinese. He began writing while a soldier in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and received international fame in 1987 for Red Sorghum: A Novel of China. Made into a film which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1988, the novella was a tale of the brutal violence in the eastern China countryside, where he grew up, during the 1920s and 1930s. Favouring to write about China's past rather than contemporary issues, the settings for Mo's works range from the 1911 revolution, Japan's wartime invasion and Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. \"He has a very impressive oeuvre,\" Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at the University of London, said. \"He has a large readership and he addresses the human condition in a way in which the Nobel Committee likes to see.\" Mo's other acclaimed works include Republic of Wine, Life And Death Are Wearing Me Out and Big Breasts and Wide Hips. The latter book caused controversy when it was published in 1995 for its sexual content and depicting a class struggle contrary to the Chinese Communist Party line. The author was forced by the PLA to withdraw it from publication although it was pirated many times. After it was translated into English a decade later, the book won him a nomination for the Man Asian Literary Prize. Despite his social criticism Mo is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, however critics have accused him of being too close to the Communist Party. \"A writer should express criticism and indignation at the dark side of society and the ugliness of human nature,\" the author said in a speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2009. \"Some may want to shout on the street, but we should tolerate those who hide in their rooms and use literature to voice their opinions.\" His latest novel, Frog, about China's \"one child\" population control policy, won the Mao Dun Literature Prize - one of his country's most prestigious literature prizes - last year.

Their demolition comes only days after IS blew up Palmyra's two main temples. The group, which captured the Unesco World Heritage site from government forces in May, has previously destroyed two Islamic shrines - those of a Shia saint and Sufi scholar - near Palmyra, which they described as \"manifestations of polytheism\". Satellite images The Valley of the Tombs, in the hills to the south and west of the ruins of the Greco-Roman city, contains a series of funerary towers of various sizes.

IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq. The sale of looted antiquities is nevertheless one of the group's main sources of funding. It has also been accused of destroying ancient sites to gain publicity.

Two years ago, Jolie, whose mother died from cancer, had a double mastectomy. \"It is not easy to make these decisions,\" she said. \"But it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue.\" Jolie, who is married to Hollywood actor Brad Pitt, elected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after a check-up two weeks ago. In the article, titled Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary of a Surgery, she said a blood test revealed \"a number\" of elevated inflammatory markers that could be a sign of early cancer, and was told to see a surgeon immediately. \"I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt. I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren,\" Jolie wrote. \"I called my husband in France, who was on a plane within hours. The beautiful thing about such moments in life is that there is so much clarity. You know what you live for and what matters. It is polarizing, and it is peaceful.\" Further tests revealed Jolie was free of a tumour, but elected to have her ovaries removed after consulting doctors. Her mother, grandmother and aunt all died of the disease. \"My doctors indicated I should have preventive surgery about a decade before the earliest onset of cancer in my female relatives,\" wrote Jolie. Analysis by Michelle Roberts, Health editor Angelina Jolie carries a 'faulty' gene, called BRCA1, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer in her lifetime unless she underwent surgery In 2013, the award-winning actress had both breasts removed to cut her risk of breast cancer And now two years later, she has had both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed These preventive steps greatly decrease her lifetime risk of cancer But the surgery does not completely guarantee that cancer will not develop - it is impossible to remove all of the at-risk tissue Both men and women who inherit faulty BRCA1, whether or not they go on to develop cancer themselves, have a 50:50 chance of passing the gene on to their sons or daughters \"My mother's ovarian cancer was diagnosed when she was 49. I'm 39.\" Writing about the procedure, saying: \"It is a less complex surgery than the mastectomy, but its effects are more severe. It puts a woman into forced menopause.\" Jolie, who is also a director and UN envoy, will now take hormone replacements. \"Regardless of the hormone replacements I'm taking, I am now in menopause,\" Jolie said. 'We applaud decision' \"I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes. But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.\" Charity Ovarian Cancer Action has praised Jolie's decision and \"bravery\". \"We applaud Angelina Jolie's decision to announce that she has had preventative surgery for ovarian cancer and are anticipating another wave of the 'Angelina Effect', which saw a dramatic increase in the number of women referred for genetic testing after Angelina announced that she had undergone a double mastectomy in 2013,\" said Katherine Taylor, the charity's acting chief executive. \"While all women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer, for those with a mutation in their BRAC1/2 genes, like Angelina Jolie, the risk increases to one in two. \"If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops, much like Angelina has. Her bravery to announce this news publicly could save lives.\" Jolie, who is married to actor Brad Pitt, has six children, three of whom are adopted. The Oscar-winning Hollywood star added: \"It is not possible to remove all risk, and the fact is I remain prone to cancer. I will look for natural ways to strengthen my immune system. I feel feminine, and grounded in the choices I am making for myself and my family. \"I know my children will never have to say: \"Mom died of ovarian cancer.\"", "summary": "美国影星安吉丽娜·朱莉（Angelina Jolie）接受了卵巢和输卵管摘除手术，以预防罹患癌症。"}

Abandoned It was scheduled to be completed in 1989 in time for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. But construction was abandoned in 1992 when North Korea suffered an economic crisis.

The American publication called it \"hideously ugly, even by communist standards.\" There are reports of poor construction and the use of inferior materials.

In a recent study done last year at Birzeit University in the Palestinian territories, researchers took a group of male rats and gave them either a fizzy sugary drink, a flat sugary drink or tap water to consume. They found that the rats who regularly drank the gassy sugary drink put on more weight at a much faster rate than rats given either flat sugary liquids or tap water. When they took blood samples, they found that the rats drinking fizz had much higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, which could explain the weight gain. Cheese sandwich test It was such an interesting study that the BBC's Trust Me I'm a Doctor team thought we should do a similar experiment, but with a mix of human volunteers. With the help of Dr James Brown from Aston University in Birmingham we recruited a group of healthy volunteers. Rather cunningly, we decided not to tell our volunteers what the experiment was really about as we didn't want that knowledge to affect the results. So instead of telling them it was mainly about bubbles, we said it was about measuring the impact of sugary drinks on appetite - which was partly true. At the start of the experiment, our volunteers arrived at the lab after having gone 10 hours without food. They were then given identical, calorie-controlled cheese sandwiches to eat. The idea of doing this was to ensure that all our volunteers started with roughly similar levels of ghrelin in their blood. An hour after eating their sandwich each volunteer was given one of several different soft drinks, allocated at random. They either received a glass of a fizzy sugary drink, a glass of the same drink (but flat), a glass of fizzy water or one of flat water. Ten minutes after they had had their drink, James took a blood sample to measure the volunteers' ghrelin levels. Once he'd done that, our volunteers were sent away with a food diary - so we could assess how many calories they ate in the hours following their drink. They had to come back to the lab three more times over the next couple of weeks to eat the same cheese sandwich and have bloods taken, but each time they were given a different drink. This is what's known as a crossover trial - the idea being to try different things on the same person rather than just across a group. It means you can produce statistically significant results with fewer recruits. Ghrelin is the key Once James had crunched the numbers we gathered our volunteers together to tell them the true purpose of our study, which was to assess the impact of not only the sugar, but the fizziness, on hunger. What James had found was that ghrelin levels were about 50% higher when people had a fizzy drink. So the fizzy sugary drink makes you a lot hungrier an hour later than drinking the same drink, but flat. This increase in ghrelin wasn't only seen after drinking sugary fizzy drinks; there was also a slight effect when James and his team compared the impact of still with carbonated water. We also wanted to see what effect drinking carbonated fizz had on how much food our volunteers consumed later in the day. And that, in some ways, was even more revealing. James says: \"If you group together the carbonated drinks and the non-carbonated drinks, they ate on average 120 calories more after they had had a carbonated drink than they ate after they had a non-carbonated drink, and that's a really significant finding.\" So, on top of the 140 calories in the fizzy drink, it seems they ate another 120 calories later in the day as a direct result of the extra ghrelin that was produced by having had a drink with fizz in it. You might also like: But why should bubbles have this effect on our hunger signals? We don't know for sure, but James thinks there are two possible reasons. \"One is that after drinking a carbonated drink, carbon dioxide is released in your stomach. There are chemical receptors in the stomach which detect carbon dioxide and cause the cells at the top of the stomach to release ghrelin and it makes you feel hungry. Another possibility is it is a mechanical thing. The stomach bloats and stretches a little bit from that extra gas and again that stimulates cells to release ghrelin. Those are the best two possibilities in terms of mechanism.\" So is it OK to drink flat, sugary drinks? Unfortunately not. According to James: \"The take home message from this is sadly and boringly that the healthiest option is probably still water.\" In terms of scientific research this is early days, but it provides another good reason why people should steer clear of sweet fizzy drinks.

BBC Trust members questioned by the committee on Wednesday about payments to Mr Byford and marketing director Sharon Baylay, said they had not been informed that the pay-offs went beyond contractual terms. Lord Hall told the committee that the culture in the BBC that allowed these payouts was \"accepted but was wrong\". \"We'd lost the plot. We'd got bedevilled by zeros on salaries. There was not enough grip at the centre of the organisation. Things were devolved far too low down,\" he said. In a statement, Mr Thompson said he was \"looking forward to laying the facts in front of the Public Accounts Committee in person, but there are a couple of inaccuracies that emerged in yesterday's testimony to the PAC which I would like to clear up immediately\". 'Kept informed' He said the Trust had been kept informed of the severance packages. \"An email from my office to the head of the Trust unit makes this clear. Both this email and a detailed analysis of the value for money case for the redundancies were sent to the Trust days before the Executive Board remuneration committee met to consider the proposed packages,\" said Mr Thompson. \"I had made sure that the Trust were aware of and understood all potentially contentious issues,\" he said. In 14 of the cases looked at by the NAO, the payments far exceeded the amount to which the outgoing executives were entitled. Mr Thompson also pointed out that he was not involved in any negotiations over the severance package given to former BBC controller Roly Keating, who was given a pay-off despite leaving for another position. \"If I had been consulted, I would not have approved it.\" Mr Keating, who was appointed chief executive officer of The British Library, returned his £375,000 payment after learning it had not been properly authorised. A statement from the Trust said that the material Mr Thompson referred to in his statement was shared with the NAO for the purposes of its review. \"They noted that the Trust had no role in the approval process but were being given this material for information and to provide assurance that payments to Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay were to be made on the basis of contractual terms. \"The NAO's conclusions were the basis for our evidence given to the PAC yesterday and like the NAO, we see nothing in this correspondence which disproves any of their conclusions,\" the statement continued. \"As the chairman said yesterday, we will be interested to hear Mark Thompson's version of events when he appears before the PAC.\"", "summary": "BBC前总裁汤普森（Mark Thompson）说，BBC信托会知道前副总裁拜福德离职时拿到了94.9万英镑离职补偿金。"}

Meanwhile the UK's global height ranking fell, with 19-year-old boys being 39th tallest in 2019 (1.78m or 5ft 10in) from 28th tallest in 1985. The study appears in The Lancet. Researchers say tracking changes in the height and weight of children across the world and over time is important because they can reflect the quality of nutrition available, and how healthy environments are for young people. The team analysed data from more than 65 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years from more than 2000 studies between 1985 and 2019. They found that in 2019, on average, children and teenagers in north-western and central Europe (eg those in the Netherlands and Montenegro) were the tallest in the world. Meanwhile, the 19-year-olds who were on average the shortest lived in South and South-East Asia, Latin America and East Africa. The analysis suggests that in 2019: Healthy weight gains The study also looked at children's BMI, a measure that helps indicate whether a person is a healthy weight for their height. Researchers found older teenagers with the largest BMI lived in the Pacific Islands, Middle East, USA and New Zealand. Meanwhile 19-year-olds with the lowest BMI lived in South Asian countries such as India and Bangladesh. The researchers estimate broadly that the difference between countries with the lowest and highest BMIs in the study was equivalent to about 25kg (55lb). In some countries children reached a healthy BMI at the age of five, but were likely to become overweight by the time they were 19. While researchers acknowledge that genetics play an important part in individual children's height and weight, they say when it comes to the health of entire populations, nutrition and the environment are key. They also argue that global nutrition policies overwhelmingly focus on under-fives, but suggest their study shows more attention needs to be paid to the growth patterns of older children. Free school meals Dr Andrea Rodriguez Martinez from Imperial College London, one of the lead researchers, said healthy weights and heights in childhood and adolescence have lifelong benefits for people's wellbeing. She said: \"Our findings should motivate policies that increase the availability and reduce the cost of nutritious foods, as this will help children grow taller without gaining excess weight for their height. \"These initiatives include food vouchers towards nutritious foods for low-income families, and free healthy school meals.\" Meanwhile, Prof Alan Dangour, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was a unique and powerful analysis. He added: \"For the first time, this global analysis has focused on the growth of school-aged children and adolescents, and identifies that governments around the world are not doing enough to ensure that children enter adulthood in good health.\"", "summary": "研究显示，在儿童和青少年阶段饮食不良，平均身高可能会比其他的同龄人矮20公分。"}

In 2014 it expects global growth of 3.6%, down 0.2%. It cited weakness in emerging economies for the cut. The forecast for UK growth this year received a significant upgrade to 1.4%, up from July's estimate of 0.9%. And for next year the IMF expects UK growth of 1.9%, up from July's projection of 1.5%. The IMF's upgrades for its outlook on the UK are larger than those it made for any other country in its World Economic Outlook - its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy. It credited recent data indicating higher consumer and business confidence, for the increase. However, it warned that it would still take years for the UK economy to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis. It suggested that the government could help boost growth by bringing forward planned public infrastructure spending, such as building new homes. The UK Treasury said the IMF upgrade showed the government's economic strategy was working. \"But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan,\" a spokesman added. World growth slows Despite the improvement in growth in advanced economies such as the UK and US, the IMF warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, was holding back global expansion. It expects growth in Russia, China, India and Mexico to be slower than it forecast in July. In part, it says this is due to expectations of a change in policy by US central bank the Federal Reserve. Simply the expectation that the US could trim back its efforts to stimulate the US economy has already had an impact on interest rates in emerging economies, the IMF said. It said an increasing belief that China's growth rate would slow would also hit global growth. US fears The IMF expects the US to drive global growth. But it warns that the political standoff over raising the US government's borrowing limit, if it results in the US defaulting on its debt payments, \"could seriously damage the global economy\". It expects growth of 1.6% in the US this year and 2.6% next year, down 0.1% and 0.2% from its July forecast. In the US capital on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama remained at an impasse over a shutdown of the US government and legislation to increase the US borrowing limit. At a news conference, Mr Obama stressed that failing to raise America's so-called 'debt ceiling' would undermine the world's confidence in the United States and might permanently increase borrowing costs. Mr Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, leader of opposition Republicans who have demanded major policy concessions from the Democrats in exchange for approving a government budget and allowing debt limit increase, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday but failed to reach a resolution. Mr Boehner's office criticised the president for what it described as his unwillingness to negotiate, while the White House said Mr Obama was happy to negotiate with the Republicans but only after the US government was reopened and the borrowing limit raised. The impasse continued as the US sold one-month bonds at its highest interest rate in five years on Tuesday as investor fears rose over whether the government would reach a deal to avert a default on its debt payments. Eurozone stabilises In the euro area, the IMF says business confidence indicators suggest activity is close to stabilising in peripheral economies, such as Italy and Spain, and already recovering in core economies such as Germany. Overall, it predicts growth will fall 0.4% this year, an improvement of 0.1% on its July prediction, and grow 1% next year. \"In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly,\" said Olivier Blanchard, economic counsellor at the IMF. \"The architecture of the financial system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear.

He is known to have previously published books on the personal lives of Chinese Communist Party members. Rights groups condemned the \"harsh sentence\" and called for his release. He was one of five owners of a small bookstore in Hong Kong who went missing in 2015. It later emerged that they had been taken to China. Four were later freed, but Mr Gui remained in Chinese detention. In delivering its verdict, the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court said that his Chinese citizenship had been reinstated in 2018. China does not recognise dual citizenship. Sweden's foreign minister on Tuesday called for Mr Gui's release, referring to him a \"citizen\". \"We have not had access to the trial,\" said Ann Linde in a tweet. \"[We] demand that Gui be released and that we have access to our citizens to provide consular support.\" But according to a Reuters report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said consular arrangements had been put on hold because of the latest coronavirus outbreak, and would be restored once the health problem was \"resolved\". Zhao Lijian added that Mr Gui's \"rights and interests... [had] been fully guaranteed\". Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday also called for Mr Gui to be released immediately and said the charges were \"completely unsubstantiated\". A forced confession? Mr Gui first made headlines in 2015 when he vanished from Thailand and resurfaced in China. After his disappearance, there were allegations that he had been abducted by Chinese agents. Chinese officials, however, say Mr Gui and the four other men all went to China voluntarily. The bookseller ultimately confessed to being involved in a fatal traffic accident more than a decade earlier - a confession supporters say was forced. He served two years in prison but he was arrested months after his release while he was travelling to the Chinese capital of Beijing with two Swedish diplomats. China later released a video interview featuring Mr Gui. In it, he accused Sweden of \"sensationalising\" his case. It is not uncommon for Chinese criminal suspects to appear in \"confessional\" videos. Earlier in 2019, Sweden recalled its ambassador to China Anna Lindstedt, who was accused of brokering an unauthorised meeting between Angela Gui - the daughter of Mr Gui - and two Chinese businessmen. Ms Gui - who has been vocal in campaigning for her father's release - said one of the men had pressured her to accept a deal where her father would go to trial and might be sentenced to \"a few years\" in prison, and in return she would stop all publicity around her father's detention.", "summary": "中国浙江宁波中级人民法院2月24日发布公告称，香港铜锣湾书店股东桂敏海因“为境外非法提供情报罪”被判处有期徒刑十年。"}

Critics say they are unscientific, cannot prove whether someone is a virgin and can be a form of abuse. The tests involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact. The BBC investigation found a number of private clinics advertising \"virginity repair\" which, when contacted, then also offered the so-called virginity test for between £150 and £300. The BBC identified 21 clinics and managed to make inquiries with 16 of them, seven confirmed they offer \"virginity testing\" and several others would not clarify their position. All said they would carry out hymen-repair surgery, which costs in the region of £1,500 to £3,000. Data from NHS England shows 69 hymen-repair procedures have been carried out in the past five years. Newsbeat has heard the story of one woman helped by the charity Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called honour-based abuse and forced marriage. \"I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with my parents who wanted me to have an arranged marriage,\" she says. 'Running away was my only option' \"One day, an elder in the community saw me out with my friends and said to my mum that one of the boys was my boyfriend. There were lots of rumours in the community about it.\" She was then threatened with a \"virginity test\" by her parents. \"My parents and the family of the man they wanted me to marry said I had to have a virginity test to prove I was still a virgin so the marriage could go ahead. \"I was scared and didn't really understand what it meant. I felt running away was my only option - so that's what I did.\" Priya Manota manages the helpline for Karma Nirvana. \"We have received calls from girls who are concerned about this. It might be that they are worried their families have found out perhaps they've been in a relationship or they're not a virgin. It might be family are pressuring them to go through with tests and they are concerned about the outcome of that. \"Triggers for honour-based abuse and forced marriage are being in a relationship, choosing your own partner and being in an intimate or sexual relationship. We know at the charity many victims in extreme cases have been killed. For other victims it might be they are disowned by family.\" Virginity testing is known to be practised in at least 20 countries, according to WHO, which says there is no evidence that it can prove whether a woman or girl has had sex or not. This is because the hymen can tear for many reasons, including tampon use and exercise. Last year, US rapper T.I. sparked outrage after admitting during a podcast he takes his daughter for a test every year to check her hymen is still intact. Tweezers and fake blood Meanwhile, the BBC has also found hymen-repair kits being sold online for £50, which claim to restore virginity. One kit purchased for £104 arrived from Germany. It contained 60ml of vagina tightening gel, plastic tweezers, a blood capsule and three sachets that appear to contain fake blood. There were no instructions on how to use the kit. Dr Ashfaq Khan is a gynaecologist who regularly gets requests from patients for virginity testing and hymen repair. \"I don't understand why it is not illegal in the UK, it should be made illegal,\" he says. \"The whole idea the absence of part of the hymen means you're not a virgin is wrong first of all. It can be torn for various reasons, and if I was to say 'it is torn, I need to repair it' and then I can give you a certificate, that means I am giving a false certificate.\" 'Educate our communities' He believes more action against the practice is needed. \"The same way we push FGM [female genital mutilation] issues brilliantly, as world leaders highlighting the problem of FGM,\" he tells Newsbeat. \"And to me this is another crime - and we are associating ourselves with a procedure which is ethically and morally not correct.\" Earlier this year, the Middle Eastern Women and Society Organisation started a campaign to ban \"virginity testing\", and called for more education around the topic. Founder Halaleh Taheri said: \"Although we would like to eventually ban hymen repair, banning the practice without proper education will only do more harm than good. The only reason these practices are in business is because of this backward mentality concerning virginity. \"If we were to help educate our communities and to reverse this belief, then there would be no need for hymen reconstruction. It would go out of business on its own.\" BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women each year and shares their stories.

Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to fight crime and corruption following a string of scandals have won him mass support. However critics are worried by his praise of Brazil's former dictatorship, and by his comments on race, women and homosexuality. In one infamous incident in 2015 he told a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape. Mr Bolsonaro's controversial comments, his pro-gun stance and his populist approach to politics have led to some media dubbing him \"Trump of the Tropics\". President Trump himself took to Twitter on Monday to praise the Brazilian president-elect. For his supporters, Mr Bolsonaro is a politician who they say will bring much needed change to the country - a swing to the right after four elections won by the left. For the past four years, Brazil has been consumed by a criminal investigation - known as Operation Car Wash - that has uncovered massive corruption. Dozens of business and political leaders have been jailed. Among them was former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was barred from standing in the election. Read more: How did the result break down? Who is Bolsonaro and what is he likely to do in office? The 63-year-old leads the Social Liberal Party (PSL), an anti-establishment group that combines social conservatism and pro-market policies. Mr Bolsonaro is a deeply polarising figure who has had a divisive effect on Brazilians with both supporters and opponents taking to the streets to make their voices heard. He has in the past defended the killing of opponents to the country's former military regime and said he is \"in favour of dictatorship\". But after the results came in, he told supporters he would be a \"defender of democracy\" and uphold the constitution. One of his flagship policies is to restore security by relaxing gun laws and suggested that \"every honest citizens\" should be able to own a gun. He has promised to reduce state intervention in the economy and indicated that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He takes over on 1 January 2019. Messy future Analysis by BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo Is there a chance Mr Bolsonaro could soften his stance, now he's won power? Few experts believe it. You only need to look to another firebrand in the continent for guidance. \"The things that Donald Trump outlined and the signals that he gave during the campaign he carried through with,\" says Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review, who has studied parallels between Brazil's new president and the leader of the US. Many say a comparison with Mr Trump is inaccurate. Instead, they say Mr Bolsonaro is more akin to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Whatever the comparison, what is clear is that country's sharp swing to the right will resonate beyond Brazil as another populist takes power. And the opposition will redouble efforts not to take away the gains that country's made since it returned to democracy 30 years ago. The future looks messy for Brazil. Does Mr Bolsonaro have backing in Congress? Yes and no. On the one hand, his PSL party achieved a remarkable breakthrough in this month's legislative election, increasing its representation from one to 52 seats in the lower house. However Mr Haddad's PT remains the largest party, with 56 seats. But most ominously for Mr Bolsonaro, there will be a record 30 parties represented in the next Congress. This suggest that finding backing for legislation could be difficult for the new president. What about reaction from outside Brazil? A number of Latin American leaders congratulated Mr Bolsonaro: Amnesty International said that taking into account his campaign pledges, Mr Bolsonaro's victory could pose a \"huge risk\" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, LGBT communities, black youth, women, activists and civil society organisations.", "summary": "巴西极右政党候选人雅伊尔·博尔索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）在大选中胜出，当选新一任巴西总统。"}

But what is it like on the street after the cancellation of the festival and the city's other major cultural festivals? In a normal year, the Fringe attracts so many street performers that City of Edinburgh Council has to give them time slots. But this year James Hessler had no difficulty getting himself a place on the Royal Mile. James, 58, from Midlothian, has performed on the street during 20 Edinburgh Fringes. He said: \"I wanted to come back as quickly as possible so I called the council and was given a licence. \"Normally you just have to make a loud noise and you have a huge audience during the festival but this year there is a much slower build up to attract people and so you have to have more material. \"Now we are having to build an audience but then pull it when we see it is getting too big, we do this by making the shows shorter. \"It's great to be back out on the Royal Mile and we just have to work harder to get more energy from a smaller audience.\" Todd Various, 45, from Midlothian, who has performed street theatre during 16 Edinburgh Festivals, said he estimated there was about 20% of the normal footfall of the Fringe. He said: \"This crowd is way better because it is a genuine audience making the choice to watch me. \"Normally people are muscled into watching what is closest to them.\" David Bosek, 41, from Edinburgh, said his street performance with his puppet Evan had been a hit this year. He said: \"Less people is better for my show because I can interact with people more easily and make more jokes. \"Busier makes me more money but I prefer more funny and less money. \"I've been joking all day with people this year, which I love. \"However, I do want the festival to run next year in all its full glory.\" Glynis Hammond, 36, from Watford in Hertfordshire, said she was \"shocked and happy\" at how many people there were on the Royal Mile. She said: \"I expected it to be so quiet, so to see so many tourists, so many people here, is just great.\" Glynis said they should have been on holiday in Ghana, but had come to Edinburgh instead. She and her daughter Nia had visited the castle and had caricatures done by a street artist in the Royal Mile. \"It is our first time in Scotland and it makes me want to come back,\" she said. \"I'm thinking of talking my husband into the Scottish Highlands for Christmas now that I've seen how great it is here. Rafkha Gibrani, 20, from Brighton, was making his first trip to Edinburgh. He said: \"I was due to be in Mauritius but it was cancelled so I have come to Edinburgh instead and I am staying with friends. \"I wasn't expecting it to be this busy but I am happy to see more people because it means things are getting back to normal. \"I am enjoying my trip so much and will definitely come back when the Edinburgh Festival is on again.\" Shops, restaurants and bars in and around the Royal Mile said footfall had been nothing like the levels they would normally experience during the festivals in August. Naz Issa, manager of Laila's Bistro in Edinburgh's Cockburn Street, said his takings were down to a third of what he would have expected at this time of year. He said: \"It's been nowhere near as busy, not even half as busy. \"It's certainly not a ghost town now, but normally it's chock-a-block on the Royal Mile with 50,000 people and now there are just a few thousand. \"During the festival it is very difficult to walk down the Royal Mile. There is still life here now but it's not the same buzz. \"I'm looking forward to next year when the festival returns.\" Daniela Scott, who runs her father's Italian restaurant Gordon's Trattoria, said: \"Normally it takes me 15 minutes to walk down the Royal Mile to our restaurant during the festival because it is absolutely rammed. \"Now its like a winter's day. \"The Royal Mile is breathing again but there is no buzz and it's not comparable just now to previous August days during the festival. \"We need the festival back next year.\" Kitty Bruce-Gardyne, director of Scottish Textiles in the Tron Kirk on the Royal Mile, said: \"It's much emptier now. The comparison is dire. In the festival there are hordes of people walking past the door. \"I miss the festival. There is no buzz just now, it is sad. \"The Royal Mile is a different Edinburgh just now, it's an Edinburgh for locals.\" .", "summary": "来自世界各地的数千名艺人云集苏格兰爱丁堡，参加世界上最大的艺术节--爱丁堡边缘艺术节。"}

The whole EU is struggling to deal with an unprecedented influx of migrants. Some 2,000 people, mostly from the Middle East, remain stranded outside a railway station in Hungary after police stopped them travelling through the EU. The EU's border control agency, Frontex, says 23,000 migrants arrived in Greece last week alone - an increase of 50% on the previous week. Latest updates More than 160,000 people have arrived in Greece so far this year - already surpassing last year's total. But in a reminder of the dangers they face, reports on Wednesday said at least 11 migrants, believed to be Syrians, were feared drowned after two boats sank as they left Turkey for the Greek island of Kos. Greece's government says it lacks the resources to look after that many arrivals, but aid groups say authorities should be doing more. On Tuesday, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos called his French counterpart Francois Hollande and asked that the situation facing Greece be discussed at a senior European level. Greece's caretaker cabinet is set to convene later on Wednesday. Many of those arriving in the country do so on the island of Lesbos, where, according to the Kathimerini newspaper, 17,500 migrants were registered in the last week. One ferry carrying 1,749 migrants travelling from Lesbos arrived in the port of Piraeus, near Athens, late on Tuesday. One of the passengers, a Syrian teacher named Isham, told Reuters news agency: \"You have to help us. We are human.\" Another, with close to 2,500 on board, was due to arrive on Wednesday. At-the-scene: Nick Thorpe in Budapest, Hungary The stalemate around Keleti station continues. Many families are trying to decide what to do now. Everyone is asking each other the same question - will they be allowed to carry on their journeys or are they stuck here until their money runs out? Lines of police are currently blocking the entrance to the station. People are very frustrated and very angry. I was talking to two Syrian girls who said they hadn't washed for days. They said the Hungarians looked down on them, and that hotels and restaurants around the station were increasingly not allowing them in. They feel very humiliated by the situation. Under an EU rule known as the Dublin Regulation, refugees should seek asylum in the first EU country they enter. But Italy and Greece - the main landing points - say they cannot cope with the numbers and many migrants head north. On Monday, Hungary had appeared to abandon efforts to register migrants, allowing huge numbers to board trains at Keleti station in east Budapest and travel to Vienna and southern Germany. But on Tuesday the Hungarian authorities sealed off the station to migrants, saying it was trying to fufill its obligations as an EU member by upholding border controls. Overnight, some 2,000 people remained camped outside the station. Syrian's perilous journey to Sweden In photos: One day across destination Europe Five obstacles to an EU migrants deal The migrants who risk everything for a better life Full coverage of Europe migrant crisis Hundreds of migrants again protested on Wednesday morning, chanting \"Freedom, freedom\" and waving train tickets. Members of the crowd have complained that they had paid hundreds of euros for tickets to Austria or Germany. Hungary said it would now register all migrants and send those it considered to be economic migrants back to the state from which they entered the country. The German government has already said it will allow Syrians arriving from other EU states to apply for asylum. But on Tuesday, a spokesman said the Dublin Regulation had not been suspended. \"Dublin rules are still valid and we expect European member states to stick to them,\" an interior ministry spokesman said. Elsewhere in Europe, trespassers on the tracks of the Channel Tunnel and reports of migrants on train roofs caused disruption to trains between France and the UK overnight. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. Germany expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year - four times last year's total. Migrants or refugees? The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another\". A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The word migrant has traditionally been considered a neutral term, but some criticise the BBC and other media for using a word they say implies something voluntary, and should not be applied to people fleeing danger. Battle over words to describe migrants The risks for migrants travelling through Europe were highlighted last week by the deaths of 71 people found in a lorry that had travelled to Austria from Budapest. As a result, Austria reintroduced border controls at main crossings from Hungary. EU interior and justice ministers will meet in Brussels on 14 September to address the crisis.", "summary": "数千多名难民搭乘渡轮抵达希腊本土的港口，而欧洲各国也正在准备商讨如何对应大批涌入的难民。"}

But last year he was able to purchase a rifle he used in Sunday's attack on a small church outside San Antonio. He killed 26 people and fled the scene. He was later found dead in his car. Police said he died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by armed bystanders. Kelley was also shot in his leg and torso by a citizen, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. In a statement, the Air Force said: \"Initial information indicates that [Devin] Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations.\" It said it was now - together with the Department of Defense - investigating the handling of Kelley's criminal records. Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier said Kelley, 26, should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley bought the rifle from the Academy Sports + Outdoors shop in San Antonio. The store issued a statement sending \"deep condolences\" to the victims' families. Mother-in-law argument Kelley was armed with the semi-automatic rifle and two pistols when he attacked the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during Sunday services. He had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials said. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. \"This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,\" said Mr Martin. \"There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,\" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. \"We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,\" Mr Martin added. On Monday evening, a vigil was held in Sutherland Springs. In one corner of the field, music played, people prayed, and hundreds of people held their hands in the air, the BBC's Owen Amos reports. In another, a floodlight illuminated 26 crosses - one for each person shot dead. Standing at the back, a feather in his cowboy hat, was Johnnie Langendorff - one of two men who chased the shooter out of town. People queued to shake Mr Langendorff's hand. At one point, a couple embraced him, and they stood in prayer for two or three minutes, our correspondent says. Who were the victims? Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting, the Washington Post reported. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Twenty people were also wounded. Who was the gunman? Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a \"bad conduct\" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Gov Abbott said: \"It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off.\" Kelley worked till last July as a security guard for an amusement park run by the Schlitterbahn company in New Braunfels near Sutherland Springs. His employment was \"terminated\" after just over five weeks, the company said. He had a licence to work as an unarmed security guard, a job that police described as \"similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation\". \"There were no disqualifiers entered into the national crime information database to preclude him from receiving a private security licence,\" police said. The shooting comes just a month after a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire on an outdoor music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.", "summary": "美国空军称正在调查得克萨斯州枪击案行凶者凯利（Devin P Kelley）犯罪纪录移交中的问题。"}

Croatia and Serbia then said they would follow suit. Some 13,000 migrants are now stranded at the Macedonia-Greece border. The moves come after the EU and Turkey set out a plan to ease Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War Two. Under the plan, still to be finalised, all migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey would be sent back. For each Syrian returned, a Syrian in Turkey would be resettled in the EU. Announcing the plan on Monday, European Council President Donald Tusk, said there would no longer be a path to Europe for migrants. \"The days of irregular migration to Europe are over,\" he said. In another development, leading international non-governmental organisations accused the French government of planning to close a purpose-built camp for refugees and migrants outside the French town of Dunkirk. The newly-opened site has been described as the first in France to meet international standards, and provides shelter, food, sanitation and medical care for almost 1,200 people, but officials have said they are concerned about security and potential fire hazards. More on the migrant crisis Hundreds of thousands of migrants have travelled through Macedonia over the past year, heading north. But Macedonia began to limit the numbers, first to Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi migrants, then recently to just a trickle - mainly Syrians from areas it considered conflict zones. This created a bottleneck, with migrants now living in a sprawling camp at the Idomeni crossing. Macedonia's announcement came after Slovenia said late on Tuesday that it would allow in only migrants who planned to seek asylum in the country, or those with clear humanitarian needs. Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said the country's move meant that \"the Balkan route for illegal migration no longer exists\". In related moves: The BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris, says other countries such as Albania and Bulgaria will be wary of attracting attention as alternative routes for refugees and smugglers alike. There is also concern, he adds, that there could be a renewed flurry of smuggling activity before any proposed deal between the EU and Turkey comes into force. The closure of the Balkan route had clearly been on the agenda of the EU-Turkey summit on Monday, which ended without a deal. A draft statement had declared the route closed although the final wording was changed after Germany objected. The main thrust of the EU-Turkey plan is the one-in, one-out proposal for Syrian migrants. There have already been objections. The UN expressed concern at the plan on Tuesday, while Amnesty International called it a death blow to the right to seek asylum. Speaking to the BBC, Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said the proposal to send migrants back would contravene international law. Talks between the EU and Turkey will continue ahead of an EU meeting next week. What's in the EU-Turkey proposal? The EU heads said \"bold moves\" were needed, and made the following proposals: A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "马其顿政府星期三（3月9日）决定不再调允许任何移民越过马其顿和希腊边界进入马其顿，从而在实际上封锁了经过巴尔干地区北上欧洲的通道。"}

Last year, a six-year-old girl in Western Australia died as the result of a dairy allergy. The rise in allergies in recent decades has been particularly noticeable in the West. Food allergy now affects about 7% of children in the UK and 9% of those in Australia, for example. Across Europe, 2% of adults have food allergies. Life-threatening reactions can be prompted even by traces of the trigger foods, meaning patients and families live with fear and anxiety. The dietary restrictions which follow can become a burden to social and family lives. While we can't say for sure why allergy rates are increasing, researchers around the world are working hard to find ways to combat this phenomenon. What causes an allergy? An allergy is caused by the immune system fighting substances in the environment that it should see as harmless, known as allergens. These innocent substances become targets, leading to allergic reactions. Symptoms range from skin redness, hives and swelling to - in the most severe cases - vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing and anaphylactic shock. Some of the most common foods for children to be allergic to are: Where are food allergies most likely to occur? The frequency of food allergy has increased over the past 30 years, particularly in industrialised societies. Exactly how great the increase is depends on the food and where the patient lives. For example, there was a five-fold increase in peanut allergies in the UK between 1995 and 2016. A study of 1,300 three-year-olds for the EAT Study at King's College London, suggested that 2.5% now have peanut allergies. Australia has the highest rate of confirmed food allergy. One study found 9% of Australian one-year-olds had an egg allergy, while 3% were allergic to peanuts. The increase in allergies is not simply the effect of society becoming more aware of them and better at diagnosing them. It is thought that allergies and increased sensitivity to foods are probably environmental, and related to Western lifestyles. We know there are lower rates of allergies in developing countries. They are also more likely to occur in urban rather than rural areas. Factors may include pollution, dietary changes and less exposure to microbes, which change how our immune systems respond. Migrants appear to show a higher prevalence of asthma and food allergy in their adopted country compared to their country of origin, further illustrating the importance of environmental factors. Some possible explanations There is no single explanation for why the world is becoming more allergic to food, but science has some theories. One is that improved hygiene is to blame, as children are not getting as many infections. Parasitic infections, in particular, are normally fought by the same mechanisms involved in tackling allergies. With fewer parasites to fight, the immune system turns against things that should be harmless. Another idea is that vitamin D can help our immune system develop a healthy response, making us less susceptible to allergies. Most populations around the world do not get enough vitamin D for several reasons, including spending less time in the sun. In the US, the rate of vitamin D deficiency is thought to have almost doubled in just over a decade. A newer, \"dual allergen exposure\" theory, suggests food allergy development is down to the balance between the timing, dose and form of exposure. For example, the development of the allergy antibodies can take place through the skin, particularly through inflamed skin in babies with eczema. But it is thought that eating trigger foods during weaning can lead to a healthy response and prevent the allergy developing, because the gut's immune system is prepared to tolerate bacteria and foreign substances, such as food. This was the basis for King's College London's LEAP Study, which showed about an 80% reduction in peanut allergy in five-year-old children who regularly ate peanut from the year they were born. This study led to changes in US guidelines about peanut consumption in infancy. UK parents have been advised to consult their GP first. More like this Human impact The deaths of UK teenagers suffering from food allergies highlights the human impact of this condition, and the importance of clear and accurate labelling. There is currently no cure for food allergy, and managing the condition relies on avoiding the offending foods and on an emergency treatment plan in case of exposure. But even making an initial diagnosis is challenging. The main way to identify food allergies is for a patient to gradually eat increased amounts of that food under medical supervision. However, this is distressing for children, and has the risk of causing an allergic reaction. The accompanying tests of their immune systems' reaction can also give a false positive in non-allergic children. At King's College London we have developed an alternative; a blood test which has proved accurate in diagnosing peanut allergy compared with existing methods. These tests now cover the foods responsible for 90% of children's allergies, and will hopefully be available to patients in the next couple of years. Even following a successful diagnosis, avoiding trigger foods is difficult and accidental reactions are common. Allergen immunotherapy - administering small amounts of the substance - has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of allergic patients and can protect against accidental exposure. A recent immunotherapy drug trial found 67% of peanut-allergic subjects could consume the equivalent of two peanut kernels after a year, compared to 4% of the control group. Nevertheless, they are still allergic. Other treatments are being investigated for food allergy, and are much needed. In the meantime, allergies will remain a source of worry and part of daily life for the children and their parents.

She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has referred her case to Australia for possible resettlement. Thai immigration officials had initially said she should return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She then started a social media campaign, live-tweeting her case and attracting international attention. In a brief statement, Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it would \"consider this referral in the usual way\". Ms Mohammed al-Qunun posted a message on Twitter following the announcement, saying: \"Don't let anyone break your wings, you're free. Fight and get your rights!\" Refugee status is normally granted by governments, but the UNHCR can grant it where states are \"unable or unwilling to do so\", according to its website. The UNHCR says it does not comment on individual cases. Now that Ms Mohammed-al Qunun has been given this status, another country must agree to take her in. Officials in Australia have hinted that her request will be accepted. \"If she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa,\" Health Minister Greg Hunt told the ABC network before the UN determination was made public. But Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned there would be \"no special treatment\" for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. 'Rahaf is an inspiration' 'Sara', Saudi woman speaking to BBC OS on the World Service Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks. I don't have to take my whole family. This is just way too harsh on us. Living this life is exhausting. Why did she claim asylum? Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. \"My life is in danger,\" she told the Reuters news agency. \"My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.\" A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. Campaign groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director off HRW, told Reuters: \"She said very clearly that she has suffered both physical and psychological abuse. She said she has made a decision to renounce Islam. And I knew once she said that, she is in serious trouble\". On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, pleading for the UK, Canada, the US or Australia to take her in. How did the case unfold? Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight on 4 January. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, Thai police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her, an official said. She began to live-tweet her ordeal, sharing her Twitter password with friends so they too could assist in spreading the message on social media. But some social media users in her own country strongly criticized her actions. A video showed how she resisted deportation efforts by hiding in an airport hotel room, putting a table against the door to stop people from entering. She told the BBC: \"I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want.\" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun has been housed in a secure location in Bangkok since Monday night, when the Thai government allowed her to leave the airport. Her father and brother have arrived in Thailand but she is refusing to see them. Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said the pair would remain there until it was clear where Ms Mohammed al-Qunun would receive asylum. Mr Surachate said the father had denied allegations that the family were abusing her physically and emotionally. \"He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,\" he said. What is Australia's policy on asylum seekers? Many asylum seekers have tried to reach Australia on boats from Indonesia, often paying large sums to people smugglers. Hundreds have died. In 2013, the government introduced tough new policies to \"stop the boats\". Military vessels patrol Australian waters and intercept migrant boats, often towing them back to Indonesia. This and other policies have significantly curbed the number of boat journeys. Hundreds of asylum seekers who reached Australian shores years ago are held in offshore processing centres, which rights groups say expose them to widespread psychological harm. But the country has taken 656 refugees per 100,000 people through UN refugee agency resettlement schemes, more than twice as many as the United States.", "summary": "日前一名沙特阿拉伯女孩在科威特旅行时从家人身边逃走，藏入泰国曼谷一旅馆房间内并拒绝离开。澳大利亚政府称，这名女性已经被联合国认定为合法难民。"}

While the final ruling has not been made, officials say it appears they can't actually block refugees who come into the country through the resettlement program, but they can make it difficult for the non-profit organisations doing the legwork. A state can tell an NGO handling a file that they don't want to work with them and the NGO would simply go elsewhere. But uneasiness about the vetting process and fear of a similar attack in the US is growing, especially on Capitol Hill. The decision to suspend the acceptance of refugees has drawn the ire of some working to resettle them. \"It's vital to keep in mind those who are refugees are fleeing persecution,\" said Michael Mitchell, with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, an organisation working to resettle refugees in the US.

He was responding to questions about whether there was a \"gay lobby\" in the Vatican. \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" He also said he wanted a greater role for women in the Church, but insisted they could not be priests. The Pope arrived back in Rome on Monday after a week-long tour of Brazil - his first trip abroad as pontiff - which climaxed with a huge gathering on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach for a world Catholic youth festival. Festival organisers estimated it attracted more than three million people. His remarks on gay people are being seen as much less judgemental than his predecessor's position on the issue. Pope Benedict XVI signed a document in 2005 that said men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests. But Pope Francis said gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins forgotten. \"The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well,\" Pope Francis said in a wide-ranging 80-minute long interview with Vatican journalists. \"It says they should not be marginalised because of this but that they must be integrated into society.\" But he condemned what he described as lobbying by gay people. \"The problem is not having this orientation,\" he said. \"We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem.\" On the role of women in the Church, he said: \"We cannot limit the role of women in the Church to altar girls or the president of a charity, there must be more. \"But with regards to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and says no... That door is closed.\" Answering questions about the troubled Vatican bank, he said the institution must become \"honest and transparent\" and that he would listen to advice on whether it could be reformed or should be shut down altogether. \"I don't know what will become of the bank. Some say it is better that is a bank, others that it should be a charitable fund and others say close it,\" he said.

The interview was shown on TV Globo's high-profile Sunday night documentary programme Fantastico, broadcast not long after the Pope departed for Rome.

It blames the local authority and the managers of Lake Piru, north-west of Los Angeles, where the accident happened. It alleges swimmers were not adequately warned of the risks of swimming there. The late 33-year-old actress was best known for playing cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of her son by Rivera's ex-husband and the boy's father, Ryan Dorsey. It alleges that the boat rented by Rivera was \"not equipped with a safely accessible ladder, adequate rope, an anchor, a radio, or any security mechanisms to prevent swimmers from being separated from their boats\". It also said it did not have any flotation devices. It also alleges there were no warning signs at the lake alerting swimmers to potentially dangerous conditions such as strong currents, low visibility and changing water depths. The local authorities have not yet commented on the lawsuit. Rivera had rented a pontoon boat with her son - aged four at the time of the accident - at Lake Piru on 8 July. The child was found alone and asleep in the boat by a leasing agent after it was not returned, prompting a search for the actress. Her body was found a few days later and her death was later declared to have been accidental. Who was Naya Rivera? Rivera began her career as a child actress and model, appearing in TV commercials in the US. As a four-year-old, she starred in the Royal Family sitcom on CBS and had a number of other TV appearances. But it was playing cold-hearted Santana Lopez in Glee that made her a star. Glee, the musical comedy TV series, ran on the Fox network from 2009 to 2015. In 2014, Rivera starred in the horror film At the Devil's Door. The same year she married fellow actor Ryan Dorsey - who is the father of her son.

The government has given assurances that China will run only commercial operations from the port, on the main shipping route between Asia and Europe. Sri Lanka's government says money from the deal will help repay foreign loans. Under the proposal, a state-run Chinese company will have a 99-year lease on the port and about 15,000 acres nearby for an industrial zone. The plan envisages the eviction of thousands of villagers but the government says they will be given new land. China has pumped millions of dollars into Sri Lanka's infrastructure since the end of a 26-year civil war in 2009. Protests against the agreement, which were organised by the Port Workers Union, took place on the streets of the capital, Colombo, on Saturday. A coffin was carried through the streets before cardboard cutouts of Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe were set alight. Hambantota port, overlooking the Indian Ocean, is expected to play a key role in China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, otherwise known as the new Silk Road, which will link ports and roads between China and Europe. Tales from the New Silk Road The initiative is being keenly watched by regional trade rivals including India and Japan. Opponents of the project said they feared the area being turned into a Chinese colony. There were also concerns that the Chinese navy could use the port as a base. \"We are against this because it undermines our sovereignty,\" opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) told the BBC. Mr Rajapaksa, who is the eldest son of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said that India would also \"be very uncomfortable with this arrangement\". \"We have always considered Hambantota port as one of the biggest opportunities for our economy, given its strategic location,\" he said, adding: \"The government is just giving it away.\" China extends its reach - analysis from Anbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia analyst, BBC World Service Sri Lanka says the deal will help it to get out of the debt trap. It borrowed billions of dollars from China to build roads, ports and airports to revive the economy after the end of the civil war in 2009. Now it is struggling to repay Beijing. The money from the deal, officials say, will be used to repay part of the loan. Those who oppose the agreement argue that Sri Lanka is giving away its land to China. Neighbouring India is concerned as China gains a foothold close to its southern tip. Beijing is already developing ports in Myanmar and Pakistan. These ports are expected to play a key role in China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative or the new \"Silk Road\" - with huge investment in ports and roads to boost trade with rest of the world. For now, Colombo insists that the Sri Lankan navy will be in charge of security at the Hambantota port and no foreign navy will be allowed to use it as a base. There are questions over how China will respond if its huge investments overseas are threatened in the future. In a move to ease those concerns, the Sri Lankan government announced a revised deal to cut the Chinese firm's stake to 70%. Officials also made assurances that the port would not be used by the Chinese military. \"We are giving the country a better deal without any implications on security,\" Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told reporters on Friday. He said the deal would help Sri Lanka manage its foreign debt. The BBC's Azzam Ameen in Colombo says that the signing took place at the Sri Lanka Port Authority premises in the capital. The deal was inked at 10:43 (05:13 GMT) - considered an auspicious time.", "summary": "斯里兰卡将和中国签署一单11亿美元的协议，届时中国将控制和开发该国南部的汉班托塔深水港（Hambantota）。"}

Among the areas it found to be affected were procurement, prescriptions, registration of patients and payroll. The government said the report was \"highly speculative\" and \"full of inconsistencies\". To work out how much fraud is being committed, the review had to rely on estimates as well as detected fraud. It said the level of fraud was likely to be between £3.7bn and £5.7bn a year, out of a budget of more than £110bn. Among the scams highlighted were dentists claiming money for NHS care they did not carry out and GPs falsifying records for extra payments. To illustrate the scale of some of these cases, it highlighted the jailing of a Birmingham dentist in 2012 after she stole £1.4m from the NHS. Patient fraud identified included wrongful claims for free prescriptions, dental and optician care. But the biggest area of fraud was estimated to be payroll, at between £555m and £1.49bn - although the report said this mainly consisted of lots of small-scale cases. The report warned fraud was not being given the attention it deserved and it was now one of the \"great unreduced healthcare costs\". Mr Gee, who carried out his work for PFK Littlejohn accountants, said: \"There is a vast, honest majority who find fraud against the NHS to be completely unacceptable. However, there is also a dishonest minority who can cause significant financial damage. \"The best way of stopping this is not to wait for fraud to happen and then act after losses have been incurred, but to proactively deter and prevent them. Fraud is a cost to be measured, managed and minimised like any other.\" Analysis By Hugh Pym, health editor There is nothing new about fraud in the NHS. The scams are all too familiar - whether it's health service managers purchasing hospital supplies and taking backhanders or corrupt GPs claiming they have patients who don't actually exist. But the report's authors argue that, even though the NHS's fraud problem is no worse than in other healthcare systems, the need for a crackdown is as urgent as ever because of the intense financial pressure on the NHS and the need to make efficiency savings. They accuse the government of failing to carry out a detailed audit of the extent of health service fraud. The Department of Health said it didn't recognise the figures, but there has been no official denial that there is a problem that needs fixing. Fraud officers work in each local area while at a national level, fraud work is co-ordinated by NHS Protect. A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"We do not recognise the figures in this highly speculative report which is full of inconsistencies. \"We are determined to stamp out fraud in the NHS through better information sharing to prevent and deter fraud and we are working with NHS Protect on crime risks and trends to do even more in the future.\"", "summary": "消息来源称，英国国民健保NHS在英格兰地区的预算在2015年可能会缺少20亿英镑。"}

The aim of the meeting, hosted by the Zoological Society of London, is to find new ways to protect animals and reduce demand for wildlife products. An action plan will be fed into another meeting hosted by the UK government. This will take place on Thursday at Lancaster House, with international leaders gathering to discuss a global response to animal poaching. They will be joined by Prince Charles and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. They have jointly released a video campaign urging people to \"unite for wildlife\". Prof Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said: \"It's clear that illegal wildlife trafficking is completely out of control, and we need to bring the best minds together to really identify some clear solutions and show clear leadership and direction.\" He has organised the two-day conference with other NGOs, which include the Wildlife Conservation Society, WWF, Traffic and Conservation International. Wildlife poaching has seen a recent boom, and it is worth an estimated £12bn ($19bn) each year. In South Africa, in 2007, 13 rhinos were killed for their horns, but in 2013, 1,004 rhinos were slaughtered by poachers. Elephants too are suffering dramatic losses. An estimated 20,000 of the giants were killed in Africa during 2012, according to work carried out for the International Union for Conservation of Nature Prof Baillie added: \"I was working in central west Africa a little over 10 years ago - and more than half the elephants I saw would now be gone.\" The meeting will also look at the trade in other species, including tigers, which are thought to number just 3,200 in the wild, and pangolins, which are traded at high volume. The conservationists at the conference will discuss ways to stem the growing markets for wildlife products. Naomi Doak, from Traffic, said the demand for animal products in Asian counties such as Vietnam was growing. \"There is still a very strong underlying belief in rhino horn's medicinal value, but we've seen a move away from that towards its use as a reinforcer of social status; a validation almost of people's emerging position in an economy that is growing incredibly fast,\" she said. The meeting will also look at how conservationists can better protect animals. Prof Baillie said: \"People on the ground need to have the tools, the technology and the money to implement conservation effectively.

A recent study by streaming service Deezer found 15% of people below the age of 25 had never listened to an album all the way through. The survey of more than 2000 UK-based adults, found that 42% of people simply opted for playlists - either their own, or ones curated by streaming services - rather than playing albums in full. However, a separate study revealed that listening to an album is one of the best ways to de-stress - beating activities like gardening, exercising or taking a nap. According to a survey of 2,019 adults, listening to an album was the third most-popular activity for improving mood and mental well-being, after comfort-eating and reading (which came first).

As he dug deeper, he realised it was the language of his maternal grandparents. Mr Wong had heard smatterings of Kristang while growing up. But his grandparents were hardly fluent. His mother couldn't speak Kristang at all. \"As a child I had learnt Mandarin and English in school, and my parents speak in English to me. So I never really recognised that side of my heritage,\" says Mr Wong, who is half Chinese and half Portuguese Eurasian. Kristang is the language of the Portuguese Eurasians, a minority group descended from Portuguese settlers who arrived in the region in the 16th Century and married locals. A unique creole of Portuguese and Malay, with elements of Chinese languages such as Mandarin and Hokkien, it was spoken by at least 2,000 people across the Malayan archipelago at its peak in the 19th Century, according to Mr Wong. But today there may be as few as 50 fluent speakers left in Singapore, along with more in Malaysia where the language is also in decline. You may also like: The main reason for its decline is that its own community has come to see it as economically irrelevant. When the British ran Singapore and what is now Malaysia, many Portuguese Eurasians found work in the civil service. English therefore came to be seen as more important than Kristang, and many began to discourage their children from speaking it. 'I was belted for speaking Kristang' Bernard Mesenas, 78, remembers being belted as a child by his father when he was caught speaking Kristang. \"My father did not like it, he said I couldn't speak it because it would spoil my English,\" he told the BBC. \"I would argue, 'But it's Grandma's tongue.' Then he would put his hands on his belt and I would hide behind my mother.\" When the British left, the newly independent countries of Malaysia and Singapore set about the task of deciding which languages spoken by their multicultural populations should be officially recognised - Kristang was not one of them. It continued to decline as Eurasians married other races, and their children spoke other languages. In Singapore, where every child must learn a second language after English, many Eurasians have chosen to learn Mandarin. Even in the Portuguese settlement of Malacca, the birthplace of Kristang and still home to a large Portuguese Eurasian community, the language is slowly fading away. Kristang researcher Prof Stefanie Pillai of the University of Malaya says many families have long tolerated their children speaking English. \"Thus, sadly, even though you can hear the creole being spoken in the settlement... there are young people who grew up here but are not fluent in the creole, and instead are dominant speakers of English,\" she says. Critical mass But Mr Wong and a group of language enthusiasts hope to change things. Their group, called Kodrah Kristang - \"Awaken Kristang\" - holds weekly free language classes. They aim to build a critical mass of fluent Kristang speakers who can pass it on to future generations. Each week, about 200 students - many of them Portuguese Eurasians - attend their classes. Among them are Mr Wong's own grandparents. The irony of learning their native tongue from their grandson is not lost on them. \"It never dawned on me that Kristang was my language, I'd always thought it was English,\" says Mr Wong's 80-year-old grandmother Maureen. \"I've missed it, I feel I should have learnt it better to speak it to my own children. \"But it's not too late to learn,\" she adds. \"And I think it's great that a younger person can teach an older person, especially when it's your grandchild.\" Filling the gaps But reviving a dying language is not easy. One main challenge is that Kristang is mostly a spoken language and has rarely been recorded. There is no standardised spelling or pronunciation system - one word can have dozens of variations. The word for four, quartu, can be spelt and pronounced in 20 different ways. And because it has been in decline for so long, it has huge gaps in its vocabulary. Kristang does not have words for basic concepts such as apple, nurse, station or camera. \"But we do have several words for genitalia,\" deadpans Mr Wong. To solve this problem, his group invented new words with mash-ups of Kristang's root languages. For instance, the Kristang word for apple is \"manzang\", an adaptation of the Portuguese word \"maca\" using a Malay linguistic rule. A panda is \"bruangatu\" or \"bear cat\", a translation of the Chinese term for panda using Malay words. Some of these linguistic inventions can take on a poetic bent - a camera is \"pintalumezi\" or \"light-painting machine\", while grammar is \"osulingu\", or \"bones of language\". The group has also organised visits to the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca, started work on a dictionary and textbook, created free online audio courses, and even done YouTube covers of pop songs in Kristang. In May they will hold the first ever Kristang festival called Festa, featuring talks, workshops and a heritage tour. In a welcome sign, the event has received Singapore government funding. They may still be a long way off from seeing Kristang become a living, breathing, widely spoken language again, but it's a first step. \"One day we would like to see Kristang be recognised by the wider community,\" says Mr Wong. \"There are no economic reasons for it to come back. But it's part of our shared historical fabric and heritage.\"", "summary": "直到两年前，大学生黄智强（Kevin Martens Wong）对自己的家乡话一无所知，更别说能讲。"}

If the internet was an economic sector it would be the UK's fifth largest, said the report from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This would make the sector larger than the construction, transport and utilities industries. Central pillar Some 60% of the £100bn a year figure is made up from internet consumption - the amount that users spend on online shopping and on the cost of their connections and devices to access the web. The rest comes from investment in the UK's internet infrastructure, government IT spending and net exports. The report, The Connected Kingdom: How the internet is transforming the UK, says that the internet's contribution to GDP is set to grow by about 10% annually, reaching 10% of GDP by 2015. The UK, according to the report, is the world's leading nation for e-commerce. For every £1 spent online to import goods, £2.80 is exported. \"This is the opposite of the trend seen in the offline economy, which exports 90p for every £1 imported,\" the report says. Internet companies play a vital role in employment with an estimated 250,000 staff, the report finds. Small businesses that actively use the internet report sales growth more than four times greater than that of less active companies. The report also attempts to compare the UK to other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Under its scoring system, the UK ranks sixth, above Germany, the US and France.

The US has restricted the use of Huawei products over national security concerns. It has also been lobbying allies to shun the Chinese telecoms firm. Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment and services providers. The lawsuit is part of a wider push by the company in recent months to challenge claims its products pose security risks. \"The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\" Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement. \"This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming US consumers.\" Speaking at a press conference in Shenzhen, Mr Ping also accused the US government of misleading the public about Huawei and of hacking its servers. Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk said it was \"the most open [and] transparent company in the world\". But the company was later criticised for cutting the live feed of its conference before journalists could begin asking questions. What does the lawsuit say? Huawei is challenging the constitutionality of Section 889 of the National Defense Authorisation Act. The complaint has been filed in a US federal court in Texas. Huawei also rejected claims it had any links to the state, saying in a statement the firm was \"not owned, controlled, or influenced\" by the Chinese government. Several governments around the world, including Australia and New Zealand, have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks, citing security concerns. Huawei strikes back Analysis: John Sudworth, BBC News, Shenzhen Huawei is beginning its fight back. It is not just the company's reputation that is at stake, but perhaps the future of the global internet too. The US argues that the political realities in China mean all companies are beholden to the will of the Chinese Communist Party which could use Huawei to spy on, or to disrupt, critical next generation mobile networks. Huawei's case is that there is no evidence that it has ever done anything to harm the interests of its consumers. In the end, it may come down to how much latitude the courts decide the US Congress has in defining national security interests. The case, if it proceeds, could pass through a series of appeals and take many months. As China continues to push out into the world, the big question is to what extent the unreformed system of Leninist control back home should be a concern. What are the other points of contention? In addition to restricting the purchase of Huawei products, the US is also pursuing criminal charges against the firm and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. Ms Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December, at the request of the US. She was detained on suspicion of fraud and breaching US sanctions on Iran, and faces extradition to the US. Last week, Ms Meng filed a civil claim against Canada's government, border agency and police for \"serious breaches\" of her civil rights. Mr Ren recently told the BBC that his daughter's arrest was politically-motivated. That possibility was also raised by Ms Meng's lawyer in her scheduled court appearance in Vancouver on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Ms Meng's case if it helped to avoid a further decline in US relations with China. How has Huawei reacted? The lawsuit is part of a broader, more aggressive strategy by the Chinese tech giant to counter what it sees as an American \"smear\" campaign. It has taken out ads in the foreign press and invited foreign journalists to visit its campuses as part of new public relations push. In perhaps its most striking move, it appealed to the American public in a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, telling them not to \"believe everything you hear.\"", "summary": "华为（Huawei）宣布发起诉讼，控告美国政府——此前美国禁止政府机构使用华为产品。"}

Current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha sought to reassure Thais about the succession in a TV address on Saturday, saying they should not worry. This issue was discussed when Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn summoned the regent and Gen Prayuth for an audience, according to Gen Prayuth. The 64-year-old crown prince \"asked the people not to be confused or worry about the country's administration or even about the succession\", Gen Prayuth said in his TV statement. \"He said at this time everyone is sad, he is still sad, so every side should wait until we pass this sad time.\" Questions about the crown prince's capabilities have been raised in the past, although the strict lese-majeste laws prevent any open discussion of these. Gen Prayuth took power in a military coup in 2014 which overthrew the civilian government. He has promised elections next year. The monarchy is seen as a unifying force in Thailand at times of political upheaval and King Bhumibol, who died aged 88, was a figure revered by many Thais.

The lorry has been towed away for forensic examination. Police say they should be able to give more information on the number of bodies on Friday morning. The grim find comes as a summit focusing on migration takes place in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Tens of thousands of migrants from conflict-hit states in the Middle East and Africa have been trying to make their way to Europe. Austria's Chancellor Werner Faymann said the tragedy showed once again \"how necessary it is to save lives by combating criminals and people traffickers\". The vehicle - a refrigerated lorry with Hungarian licence plates - was found parked off the A4 motorway between Parndorf and Neusiedl am See, according to Burgenland police chief Hans Peter Doskozil. The vehicle was there from around 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Thursday morning, Mr Doskozil said. But Hungarian cameras had identified that the truck was on the Hungarian side of the border, very close to Austria, at 09:00 on Wednesday, he said, so it must have been driven across the border in the intervening time. The decomposing state of the bodies would suggest that they had been dead for one and a half to two days, the police chief added, suggesting that the victims must have already been dead when the lorry crossed into Austria. On Thursday afternoon the truck was towed away to undergo forensic examinations in Nickelsdorf. Police will give a further news conference at 11:00 on Friday, when they should be able to say how many people have died. They do not yet know who the victims were or how they died. The truck bears the logo of a Slovakian poultry company, Hyza, which said in a statement that the vehicle no longer belonged to the firm - but the new owners had not removed the branding. Hungarian police are working with Austrian police on the investigation, a spokesman for the Hungarian prime minister said. Hungary had been informed that the driver was Romanian, the spokesman said. At the scene: Bethany Bell, BBC News The lorry in which dozens of people died was sitting in a lay-by on the main motorway between Vienna and the Hungarian and Slovakian borders. As we drove past, I saw police in white forensic suits combing the area for evidence. It is hot. The smell of so many decomposing bodies close up must be difficult to take. In Vienna, Serbia and Macedonia have told the summit on migration that EU must come up with an action plan to respond to the influx of migrants into Europe. Austria has complained that the EU has failed to address the problem of people entering via the Western Balkans. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday's find \"reminds us to tackle the issue of migration with European spirit and find solutions\". A record number of 107,500 migrants crossed the EU's borders last month and on Wednesday police counted more than 3,000 crossing into Serbia. Many make their way north from Greece. The International Organization for Migration said on Thursday that an estimated 209,457 migrants had entered Greece between 1 January and 25 August this year, nearly five times the number that arrived in the whole of 2014. Meanwhile migrants are continuing to die as they try to reach Europe via the central Mediterranean route.

Out of season, its beautiful curved sandy bay seems to be occupied by hundreds of seals. But look more closely and they are, in fact, defiant winter surfers in wetsuits. Just beyond a long breakwater is the historic Spanish town of Hondarribia and its sprawling, built-up neighbour Irun. The natural border is the river Bidassoa, which flows into an estuary dividing the two countries. As you go upstream from the river mouth, the view changes. Imposing and colourful Basque buildings give way to industrial warehouses on the French side, and unappealing residential tower blocks on the Spanish. But what I have come to see is Pheasant Island (in French Ile des Faisans, in Spanish Isla de los Faisanes). It's not easy to find. When I ask for directions, nobody understands why I want to go there. They tell me there is nothing to see and warn me you can't visit it - no-one lives there, it's not a tourist destination like Mont St Michel. But there it is - a peaceful, inaccessible island in the middle of the river, with tree cover and neatly trimmed grass, and an old monument which pays tribute to a remarkable historical event that happened here in 1659. For three months, the Spanish and French negotiated the end to their long war on the island, as it was considered neutral territory. Wooden bridges were extended from both sides. The armies stood ready as the negotiations began. A peace agreement was signed - the Treaty of the Pyrenees. Territory was swapped and the border demarcated. And the deal was sealed with a royal wedding, as the French King Louis XIV married the daughter of the Spanish King Philip IV. Find out more One other detail was that the island itself was to be shared between the two countries, with control rotating from one to the other. For six months of the year, from February 1 to 31 July, it's under Spanish rule - and for the following six months it's French. This sort of joint sovereignty is called a condominium, and Faisans Island is one of the oldest in existence. The naval commander in the Spanish town of San Sebastian and his French counterpart in Bayonne act as governors or viceroys of the island. In reality they have bigger fish to deal with, so it's up to the Mayors of Irun and Hendaye to take turns looking after the island. Benoit Ugartemendia runs the parks division for the local council in Hendaye. He told me he sends a small team once a year by boat to the island to cut the grass, trim the tree branches and that's about it. The river is tidal - you can sometimes reach the island by foot from Spain - so as well as cutting the grass, the Spanish police chase off illegal campers. The island is tiny - just over 200m long and 40m wide. Very occasionally, the public is invited to visit on heritage open days, but Benoit says it only interests older people and younger people know nothing of its historical importance. These days, crossing from France to Spain by land is a seamless experience except for the gridlocked traffic - but under the Franco dictatorship, the border was heavily policed. The Mayor of Hendaye, Kotte Ecenarro, told me there used to be sentry points every 100m along the river facing the island to prevent opponents getting in or out. These days, the mayors of Irun and Hendaye meet about a dozen times a year to discuss issues like water quality and fishing rights. In the past, Spanish fishermen have complained about the shape of French boats and lately have been upset with French holiday makers in canoes disrupting their business. The island itself is a low priority. It's being eroded - it has lost nearly half of its size over the centuries, as snow melt rushes down from the Pyrenees and into the river. But neither country wants to spend money building up the island's defences. This year, there will be no ceremony marking the handover. There was an idea to fly the flag of whichever country was currently in - but Mr Ecenarro the mayor told me that until recently, that would only have encouraged the Basque Separatists to take it down or replace it with their own. So in a few days' time - perhaps the world's most undisputed border island will change ownership again. And in August Spain will hand it back once more.

But instead it received 10,000 tonnes of waste per day - the most of any landfill site in China. China is one of the world's biggest polluters, and has been struggling for years with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate. How big is the landfill site? The Jiangcungou landfill in Xi'an city was built in 1994 and was designed to last until 2044. The landfill serves over 8 million citizens. It spans an area of almost 700,000 square metres, with a depth of 150 metres and a storage capacity of more than 34 million cubic metres. Until recently, Xi'an was one of the few cities in China that solely relied on landfill to dispose of household waste - leading to capacity being reached early. Earlier this month, a new incineration plant was opened, and at least four more are expected to open by 2020. Together, they are expected to be able to process 12,750 tonnes of rubbish per day. The move is part of a national plan to reduce the number of landfills, and instead use other waste disposal methods like incineration. The landfill site in Xi'an will eventually become an \"ecological park\". How much waste does China produce? In 2017, China collected 215 million tonnes of urban household waste, according to the country's statistical yearbook. That's up from 152 million ten years earlier. The country had 654 landfill sites and 286 incineration plants. It is not clear what China's recycling rate is, as no figures have been released. China plans to recycle 35% of waste in major cities by the end of 2020, according to one government report. This July, sorting and recycling rubbish was made mandatory in Shanghai - leading to \"a sense of panic\" among some residents. In 2015, there was a landslide at a rubbish dump in the southern city of Shenzhen, killing 73 people. The dump was designed to hold four million cubic metres worth of rubbish, with a maximum height of 95 metres. When it collapsed, it was holding 5.8m cubic metres of material with waste heaps up to 160m high. Does China deal with other countries' waste? Not anymore. It used to, until the end of 2017 when it decided to ban the import of 24 different grades of rubbish. In 2017 alone, China took in seven million tonnes of plastic rubbish from Europe, Japan and the US - and 27 million tonnes of waste paper. Other countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, the Philippines and Indonesia, have picked up some of the slack. But they struggled to deal with the amount of waste coming in - often times resulting in massive, out-of-control landfills in their own countries. Some of these countries have now banned the import of certain types of rubbish and are even sending it back. Additional reporting by Ellen Jin", "summary": "中国最大的垃圾填埋场已经满了，比原计划整整提前了25年。"}

A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The weakening of the pound following the Brexit vote boosted exports, the survey found. However, it also indicated that the weak pound had pushed up firms' costs. A weakening of the pound makes UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers, but increases the cost of goods imported into the UK. Since the Brexit vote, the pound has fallen in value by more than 10% against both the US dollar and the euro. Following the release of the latest PMI survey, the pound jumped by 1%, more than a cent, against the dollar, to $1.33 before falling back slightly. Against the euro, the pound was 0.6% higher at just under €1.19. 'Marked recovery' Markit said the month-on-month increase in the PMI level was the joint largest in the survey's 25-year history. \"The August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit. \"The domestic market showed a marked recovery, especially for consumer products, while the recent depreciation of sterling drove higher inflows of new business from the US, Europe, Scandinavia, Middle East and Asia,\" he added. Mr Dobson also said that inflation was \"raising its ugly head\". \"Rates of increase in input prices and output charges both hit five-year highs, which manufacturers placed squarely at the door of the cost impact of sterling on import prices,\" he said. The latest PMI survey chimes with last week's CBI survey, which showed that export orders were rising at their fastest rate in two years. At the time, the July PMI figure was taken as immediate evidence of an impending downturn, following June's referendum vote in favour of the UK leaving the EU. It was one of the pieces of evidence that contributed to the Bank of England's recent decision to cut its interest rate to 0.25%. 'Robust data' But Laith Khalaf, from the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the latest PMI figures now called the Bank's decision into question. \"It certainly seems that companies and consumers alike are carrying on with business as usual now the referendum is disappearing into the rear view mirror,\" he said. \"There's still a long way to go until Britain leaves the EU, and in the meantime, businesses still need to make money, so they can't just sit on their hands. \"However, the gathering pile of robust economic data might start to dissuade policymakers from any further monetary easing,\" he added.

On Monday, it was confirmed Cole had cancelled all of her work commitments this week on the advice of doctors. Cole recently returned from a break in Tanzania, on the east coast of Africa, with friend and dancer Derek Hough. Her spokesman confirmed she had been taking anti-malaria tablets while on holiday. Mosquito bite The Sun reported Cole collapsed at a photoshoot for her second solo album on Saturday and was diagnosed with exhaustion and gastroenteritis. The early symptoms of malaria include a headache, aching muscles and weakness or a lack of energy. This means it can be confused for other conditions like exhaustion or flu. Malaria is transmitted by an infected mosquito and it only takes one bite to contract the disease. Simon Cowell is currently filming the audition stage of ITV talent show The X Factor with Cole. He told the singer: \"Don't rush back. Health is a priority and get some rest to recover properly.\" An X Factor spokeswoman said an audition in Manchester would go ahead as planned on Friday with a judging panel of Cowell, Louis Walsh and Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, who is standing in for a heavily-pregnant Dannii Minogue. Cole, alongside other celebrities, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity in March last year. The group raised £3.5 million for Comic Relief for use in Africa and the UK. Turbulent year Some of the money raised is helping to tackle malaria. In Africa, one in every five childhood deaths is due to the effects of the disease. Comic Relief chief executive Kevin Cahill said it was \"deeply unfair\" that Cole had caught malaria after the star had \"done more than her bit\" to help prevent the disease. He said: \"We're very sorry to learn that Cheryl has been diagnosed with malaria and wish her a speedy recovery. \"Cheryl did an amazing thing climbing Kilimanjaro last year and raising millions to buy bed nets for thousands of families and children in Africa - the first step to preventing malaria,\" he added. Cole's ill health comes during a turbulent year for the star. She split from her husband, England footballer Ashley Cole, in February and filed for divorce three months later. Since then, she has been kept busy touring as a solo act for the first time, supporting hip-hop band Black Eyed Peas, and recording her second album.

The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901. \"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,\" Munro told Canadian media. Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000). Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway. Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win. \"She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added. Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950. She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time. Chekov Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award. In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements. \"I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents,\" she once said in an interview with Book Lounge. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been \"at the very top of her game since she started\". \"Very few writers are her equal,\" he said, adding \"she gets to the heart of what it is to be human\". \"I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers.\" The award \"probably won't make a commercial difference\" to the author, he added, but it \"makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms\". \"If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission.\" Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town. The Nobel academy praised her \"finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism\". 'Pipe dreams' Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was \"terribly surprised\" and \"delighted\". Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as \"one of those pipe dreams\" that \"might happen, but it probably wouldn't\". \"It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course,\" she added. Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario. Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize. Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway. In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review. Retirement Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent. Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last. \"Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be,\" she told Canada's National Post. In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition. Notoriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events. According to American literary critic David Homel: \"She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours. Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize. Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.", "summary": "瑞典学院星期四（10月10日）宣布，加拿大作家爱丽丝·门罗（Alice Munro）获得2013年诺贝尔文学奖。"}

On the morning of 15 September 2017 an explosion on a rush-hour train at Parsons Green underground station in west London had resulted in dozens of injuries. It was the fifth act of terror in the country in less than a year, and Riddell was anxious for more information. Combing through social media looking for real-time updates, she came across the image of a burning white plastic bucket. The crude bomb that had detonated in the packed train carriage had been wrapped in a plastic grocery bag and concealed inside that bucket. To Riddell, the image had a powerful resonance. \"That,\" she thought, \"is a suffragette bomb. Home-made and with materials you could buy in chemist's and hardware stores. That is the kind of bomb the women used to terrorise the country into paying attention.\" Riddell's interest in the suffragettes had begun five years earlier while she was studying for a PhD in history, though her first instinct had been to have nothing to do with them. \"It felt like a trap. That to be a young female historian, I had to write about women, about suffrage,\" she says. She was far more interested in Victorian music halls. They featured skits and novelty acts, and, frequented by all classes, were a democratic and affordable form of entertainment. \"They were the internet of their day,\" says Riddell. \"Just like memes appear on social media today, a song would be written and performed in music halls on the day of a significant cultural event. It was a raw, electric and relevant world that told of a society that differed from the restrained images often painted by historians of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Especially when it came to women. It captivated me and I was excited to learn more.\" But a chance discovery in the archives of the Museum of London, made with the help of archivist Beverley Cook, led to a dramatic change of direction. \"Bev said to me, 'I've got this unpublished autobiography of a young music hall artist, very few people have ever really looked at it. She was also a suffragette. I don't know if you're interested?' \"And I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, 'Oh God not a suffragette,'\" Riddell says. \"At that time I had a certain impression of suffragettes that many people did. I knew about the window-smashing, being chained to rails, the force-feeding, the posters and marching. I thought I knew everything there was to know about these women.\" Riddell told herself that she'd read the parts about the music halls and skip the campaigning parts. She was presented with two folders' worth of handwritten papers. About five pages in, Riddell says, an incredible voice leapt off the page. She was reading the words of a suffragette who talked openly about staging arson attacks. Other papers indicate she was also a bomber. In other words, says Riddell, she was \"a terrorist\". \"Through the pages Kitty was a such a powerful speaker. And she was telling me a violent story that I had never heard. Later I checked with my friends, my family, and even other academics I knew. They had never heard this either. This was a part of our history that most historians seemed to have shied away from exploring, and here I was with access to a primary source, a woman who was unlike anyone I had encountered in the history books.\" She calls it a Da Vinci Code moment. Riddell stayed in the archive until it closed, reading the story of Kitty Marion in one sitting. Katherina Maria Schafer had arrived in London at the age of 15 after fleeing from her abusive home in Germany. Her mother had died when she was an infant, leaving her alone with a violent and unloving father. He killed her puppy when it began to show her affection. She lived with her aunt, uncle and cousins in east London, and quickly learned English. By chance, she stumbled into the energetic and vibrant world of music halls and for the first time, the teenager felt a sense of belonging. She renamed herself Kitty Marion and began a career as an actress and dancer. \"Kitty was mesmerised by this world,\" says Riddell. \"Music halls were an exciting and cosmopolitan pocket of Victorian London. Working, financially solvent women and interracial marriages were common here. Kitty had a diverse group of friends - the son of a Chinese diplomat gave her her first cigarette. She forged fast friendships with women - strong, sexually liberated women unlike those I had read about in the history books. Women in Victorian England were generally depicted as long-suffering pious victims, not the free agents I was meeting in Kitty's autobiography.\" Marion didn't immediately champion the cause of gender equality or votes for women, but then, as Riddell puts it, \"she had a Me Too moment\". An assault by a music hall agent, whom she refers to only as \"Mr Dreck\" or Mr Trash, made Marion seriously question a career in an industry dominated by powerful men. In her autobiography she describes how her \"whole being revolted\" at the incident. \"Few women forget the first time they have been assaulted. The first time someone has decided that they have the right to touch, to kiss, to take without asking,\" says Riddell. As a travelling actress, Marion saw that she was far from alone in having to endure such an experience. You may also be interested in: Suffragists or suffragettes - who won women the vote? What did the suffragettes do for you? Does being called Emmeline change your life? \"It was the idea that women deserved a right to be safe in their working environments, and to have their independence without having to sacrifice their bodies to get it, that propelled Kitty into the fold of the suffragette movement,\" Riddell says. Marion joined the Actress Franchise League, which often staged pro-suffragette plays. After that she joined the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union and soon began to participate in demonstrations and marches, graduating later to radical acts of civil disobedience. Her first experience of prison came after she threw a brick through a Newcastle post office window, and, like an increasing number of jailed suffragettes, she went on hunger strike. The prison authorities dealt with these women by force-feeding them - violently pushing a tube into the nose or mouth. Marion protested against this first treatment by breaking a gas lamp and using mattress stuffing to set her cell on fire. Repeated imprisonments followed, mainly for arson attacks. On the night of 13 June 1913, she and a fellow suffragette set fire to a racecourse grandstand in retaliation for the death of Emily Wilding Davison, who had died after being trampled by King George V's horse during a protest at the Epsom Derby. Both were arrested the following morning. This time she was force-fed an excruciating 232 times in one day. Riddell was entranced by Kitty Marion. Here was a woman who was not a household name, but was certainly a frontline soldier in the suffragette movement, and well-known to its leaders. Riddell spent hours, then days, months and eventually years, looking through huge amounts of archival documents including personal diaries, letters, court and police records, published memoirs, and newspapers to piece together Marion's life in the movement. A little-known history of the suffragettes began to emerge. They were not just breaking windows or committing arson attacks. The women sent vials of phosphorus in the post, which would break when handled, causing postmen to suffer severe burns. They were also planting bombs. \"By the start of 1913, the suffragettes had become a highly organised terror group,\" argues Riddell. \"In May 1913 there were 52 attacks, including 29 bombs and 15 arson attacks in the country.\" Home-made bombs, much like the one that Riddell had seen on social media following London's Parson's Green attack, were found in churches, packed train carriages, halls and stations, and Riddell says that they were intended to hurt people. It was pure luck that they didn't. \"Bombs then did not detonate instantly like they do now, they fizzed and spluttered and smoked, and gave people plenty of time to get away. But they were placed in public places, with large footfall. In pamphlets suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst called the militancy \"continued, destructive guerrilla warfare against the Government\". Both suffragettes and the police called it a \"Reign of Terror\". Newspaper headlines referred to \"Suffragette Terrorism\". \"There is no doubt that this had all the hallmarks of what we would today define as terrorism,\" says Riddell. While Kitty Marion is frank about her arson attacks, she is coy about the bombs. She kept a scrapbook of clippings of arson attacks that she carried out - and included reports of bombings where the attacker is not identified. Riddell believes Kitty is claiming responsibility for these attacks. There are also revealing letters from one suffragette to another. There is some indication, Riddell adds, that the suffragettes made a co-ordinated attempt in later years to remove references to their most violent acts from published memoirs. When Riddell began to speak out publicly about Kitty Marion's violent record she faced some backlash from suffragette historians. \"One wrote a letter saying my research was 'shameful' and I should 'not continue', which was incredibly intimidating for me, a young student at the start of my career,\" says Riddell. \"Other historians were defensive, saying that there was no large whitewashing of suffragette memory. To that I'd like to address people who aren't in the elite academic bubble, 'Have you or your friends heard of suffragette bombers? Have you ever heard them called terrorists?'\" Riddell says that it was only the outbreak of World War One in 1914 that curbed the escalating militancy of the suffragettes. Kitty Marion's final arrest in the UK came the year before, on suspicion of setting fire to the grandstand at Hurst Park racecourse, near London. She was sentenced to three years in prison, of which she served several months before being released to a hospital under the provisions of the so-called Cat and Mouse Act (which allowed for the early release of prisoners who were so weakened by hunger strikes that they were at risk of death - though they were recalled to prison once their health improved). Following the outbreak of World War One the British government seized the opportunity, Riddell says, to accuse one of the most dangerous women in the suffragette movement of being a German spy. But Marion had loyal friends, and a number of high-profile suffragettes helped her travel to the US instead of returning to prison. While in New York, the itch for social justice returned. Kitty Marion made friends with Margaret Sanger and became involved with her American Birth Control movement - which went on to become Planned Parenthood. \"Here was a woman whose life linked two of the great movements of our times, and yet we don't know her name,\" says Riddell. The research Riddell carried out for her PhD became the basis of her recently published book, Death in Ten Minutes. This has been optioned as a drama series detailing the lives of Marion and her friends - a group within the suffragette movement who called themselves The Young Hot Bloods whom Riddell accuses of carrying out bomb attacks. Riddell is keen to make clear that she is not trying to tarnish the reputation of the suffragettes. \"I am so in awe of these women,\" she says. \"But we cannot shy away from what these women were in their entirety. There's an age-old saying, 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.' That is the same here.\" Riddell keeps a photo of Kitty Marion in her home. \"Kitty desperately wanted her story to be told and I'm so proud to finally be able to do that for her,\" she says. \"Everyone should know what difficult, troubling choices these women made for us to be free.\" Photos by Phil Coomes unless otherwise indicated Follow Megha Mohan on Twitter @meghamohan You may also like: These women staged headline-grabbing stunts, chaining themselves to railings and attacking property.

The British medical journal The Lancet says the baby was born prematurely in September weighing 1.8kg (3.9lb). The father said his son was \"amazing\". Cancer treatment and birth defects are the main reasons women can be left without a functioning womb. If they want a child of their own, their only option is surrogacy. Medical marvel The identity of the couple in Sweden has not been released, but it is known the mother still had functioning ovaries. The couple went through IVF to produce 11 embryos, which were frozen. Doctors at the University of Gothenburg then performed the womb transplant. The donor was a 61-year-old family friend who had gone through the menopause seven years earlier. Drugs to suppress the immune system were needed to prevent the womb being rejected. A year after the transplant, doctors decided they were ready to implant one of the frozen embryos and a pregnancy ensued. The baby was born prematurely, almost 32 weeks into the pregnancy, after the mother developed pre-eclampsia and the baby's heart rate became abnormal. Both baby and mum are now said to be doing well. In an anonymous interview with the AP news agency, the father said: \"It was a pretty tough journey over the years, but we now have the most amazing baby. \"He's no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.'' 'Step change' Two other medical teams have attempted womb transplants before. In one case, the organ became diseased and had to be removed after three months. Another case resulted in miscarriages. Prof Mats Brannstrom, who led the transplant team, described the birth in Sweden as a joyous moment. \"That was a fantastic happiness for me and the whole team, but it was an unreal sensation also because we really could not believe we had reached this moment. \"Our success is based on more than 10 years of intensive animal research and surgical training by our team and opens up the possibility of treating many young females worldwide that suffer from uterine infertility.\" Liza Johannesson, a gynaecological surgeon in the team, said: \"It gives hope to those women and men that thought they would never have a child, that thought they were out of hope.\" However, there are still doubts about the safety and effectiveness of the invasive procedure. Dr Brannstrom and his team are working with another eight couples with a similar need. The results of those pregnancy attempts will give a better picture of whether this technique can be used more widely. Dr Allan Pacey, the chairman of the British Fertility Society, told the BBC News website: \"I think it is brilliant and revolutionary and opens the door to many infertile women. \"The scale of it feels a bit like IVF. It feels like a step change. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.\" The couple, fresh from celebrating the birth of their child, will soon have to decide if they want a second. The drugs used to prevent the womb being rejected would be damaging in the long term - so the couple will either try again or have the womb removed.", "summary": "瑞典一女子在接受子宫移植之后产下一名婴儿，医生说这是医疗史上首例。"}

The 81-year-old's family informed Syria's director of antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim that he had been beheaded. Mr Karim said IS militants had tried to extract information from Mr Asaad about where some treasures were hidden. He described Mr Asaad as \"one of the most important pioneers in Syrian archaeology in the 20th Century\". The murder has been denounced as a \"horrific act\" by Unesco, the UN cultural organisation. \"They killed him because he would not betray his deep commitment to Palmyra,\" Unesco Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement. \"His work will live on far beyond the reach of these extremists,\" she said. \"They murdered a great man, but they will never silence history.\" IS has demolished several ancient sites in Iraq, and there are fears that it will destroy Palmyra, one of the archaeological jewels of the Middle East. 'Stores of gold' The Syrian state news agency, Sana, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Mr Asaad had been beheaded on Tuesday at a square outside the museum in the modern town next to the ruins, also known as Tadmur, in front of dozens of people. Photos apparently showing Mr Asaad's body tied to what appears to be a lamp-post adjoining a main road have been circulated online by IS supporters. His severed head was placed underneath it. A sign attached to the body accused him of being an apostate who was in regular communication with and supported the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He was also accused of representing Syria at overseas conferences with \"infidels\", in addition to being director of Palmyra's \"idols\". The summary killing was one of several that have been carried out by IS in and around Palmyra since they took the city in May. Mr Asaad spent most of his life working to promote and protect Palmyra. He was in charge of the site for four decades until 2003, when he retired. He then worked as an expert with the antiquities and museums department. Khaled al-Asaad Profile of Syria's 'Mr Palmyra' IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Your memories of Palmyra Saving history from the jihadists Syrian ruins that influenced the West Jihadists in Palmyra were looking for \"stores of gold\" in the city, Mr Karim said, [but] \"I deny wholeheartedly that these stores exist\". Mr Karim described Mr Asaad as \"a scholar\", while denouncing the presence of IS in Palmyra as \"a curse and a bad omen\" on the city and \"every column and every archaeological piece in it\". Abdalrazzaq Moaz, co-director of cultural heritage initiatives at the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), told the BBC that Mr Asaad had devoted his entire life to the site and died trying to protect it. Since overrunning Palmyra, IS has destroyed a second century statue of a lion and two nearby Islamic shrines, which it described as \"manifestations of polytheism\". The group also released a video in July showing some 20 captured government soldiers being shot dead at Palmyra's theatre. Syrian government forces have sought to drive IS out of the Palmyra area in recent months and there has been fierce fighting in nearby towns. Also on Wednesday, new images were posted online appearing to show IS \"religious police\" vandalising ancient artefacts in the northern Iraqi province of Nineveh.

China had \"immediately suspended the import of pork products from the relevant enterprises\" after finding \"ractopamine residues\" in a batch of goods sent from Canada, a statement from the Chinese embassy in Ottawa said. \"In order to protect the safety of Chinese consumers, China has taken urgent preventive measures and requested the Canadian government to suspend the issuance of certificates for meat exported to China since 25 June,\" the statement said. \"We hope the Canadian side would attach great importance to this incident... and take effective measures to ensure the safety of food exported to China in a more responsible manner.\" Canada is investigating whether tainted pork shipped along with false health certificates to China actually came from domestic producers. \"They're inauthentic certificates that are at play here and we're taking it very seriously,\" Canada's international trade minister Jim Carr said on Wednesday. \"Somebody is trying to use the Canadian brand to move product into the Chinese market.\" China bought C$310m (£186; $236) worth of pork - the Asian nation is the third-largest export market for Canadian pork - and C$63m ($48m; £38m) worth of Canadian beef and veal between January and April 2019, according to trade statistics.

Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. This vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. 1. We spend more on the NHS than ever before Last year £140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. 2. A bigger proportion of public spending goes on health Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every £1 spent on services goes on health. Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - £8bn more this Parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. 3. Key A&E targets are being missed The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks. 4. The UK's population is ageing The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. 5. Care for older people costs much more The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. 6. Increases in NHS spending have slowed But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%. As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra £8bn going in. Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. 7. The UK spends a lower proportion on health than other EU countries But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. 8. Demand for A&E is rising The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. 9. Fewer older people are getting help with social care But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at £60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. 10. Much more is spent on front-line healthcare than social care But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils? Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

Wang Chunming had a knack for selling bamboo and a willingness to ride the considerable risks in a system that had declared entrepreneurs to be an enemy class. \"Profiteering was a crime punishable by death,\" he laughs. \"But practically all the bamboo blinds in China came from Chengdu, and I was the only guy selling them.\" The story of the past 50 years has, of course, been marked by Britain's industrial decline and China's extraordinary rise. Which is how, having made his fortune first in bamboo and then in construction, Mr Wang is now in the position of signing a deal to invest more than £200m ($262m) in Sheffield, a place he talks about in a way Brits may once have spoken of China. \"When we saw Sheffield, we noticed the infrastructure was not very advanced,\" he tells me. \"There's not even a five-star hotel.\" 'Transforming' the city The £200m is, Sheffield City Council proudly boasts, \"the biggest Chinese investment deal in a UK city outside of London\" and it is just the beginning of a plan which Mr Wang says will \"transform\" the city centre with around a billion pounds of investment spread over 60 years. Starting with a new hotel - five star of course - and apartment buildings, Mr Wang says the eventual vision includes helping to overhaul Sheffield's \"problematic\" transport infrastructure and developing its universities. He's keen to show off the kind of things he's capable of, so we're taken on a tour of some of the latest projects built by his business, Guodong Construction Company. Although it has to be said, they seem to prompt as many questions as they answer. His recently opened hotel in Chengdu, the Guodong International Hotel, feels a little dated by the swish standards of most modern luxury Chinese hotels. And it comes complete with a somewhat improbable faux Greco-Roman fountain which, he tells me, he designed himself. Might we expect to see him bring his tastes to bear in a similar way on Sheffield's new cityscape, I wonder? \"I hope so,\" he replies. \"The fountain was inspired by Italian masterpieces. We should have something like this in Sheffield... or even a more magnificent one.\" We're also taken to one of Mr Wang's new apartment complexes, functional enough if not particularly inspiring, although he tells us he's the first developer in Chengdu to offer a full refund if buyers aren't totally happy. We later discover that this particular complex happens to be the subject of a legal dispute with a subcontractor suing Guodong over payment. Mr Wang brushes it off when we ask, suggesting it's a small matter and that his company will win. 'Our British partners may lose faith in us' There are, though, other questions about Guodong relating to the Sheffield investment. The construction company's shares have been voluntarily suspended a number of times in recent months while it undergoes restructuring. And just days before the Sheffield deal was signed there was a sudden change of plan, with the investment funds no longer coming from the public limited company (PLC), under the control of shareholders, but from the parent company, Guodong Construction Group, under private ownership and the control of Mr Wang. He insists there is no cause for concern. \"The main problem was if we had used our PLC to invest, the red tape would have been too complicated and time-consuming,\" he tells me. \"Not every shareholder understands every decision we make and the board may not vote for all of our decisions. There may be obstacles in executing our plans and our British partners may lose faith in us.\" Sheffield City Council also tells me it has no concerns and has been fully aware of the situation with the company stocks and ownership structures during the negotiations. And the deal has the backing of the British government, which would like it to be seen that Britain is still very much open for business following the Brexit vote. The irony is that in a referendum decision that turned largely on fears about immigration, Mr Wang's investment has only come about because of Sheffield's popularity with large numbers of Chinese students. He tells me he first discovered the city because his daughter and son-in-law were both students there and without them, the whole thing would never have happened. Politics is everything There is perhaps another clue to his motivation, which can be found hanging in the lobby of his Chengdu company headquarters. In pride of place are a series of pictures that show Mr Wang meeting a young Xi Jinping, on a visit to one of his factories many years ago. Mr Xi is, of course, now the president. Mr Wang may have started off selling his bamboo blinds against the prevailing orthodoxy of Chairman Mao's Communist Party. But like most successful businessmen he has since developed a canny knack of making the right connections, with his construction company for example winning contracts to build army bases across China. And today, the Sheffield deal almost certainly has the backing of the Chinese government, keen to strengthen ties with the UK and keen in general to encourage the acquisition of overseas assets. Mr Wang himself alludes to this, suggesting the deal brings the interests of the parties involved, as well as the UK and China, into neat alignment. Whatever the financial complexities of the way the investment is being funded, one thing is certain. In China, politics is everything, and when it comes to his political credentials, Mr Wang looks rock solid.", "summary": "英国的谢菲尔德在60年代仍然十分繁荣，数百年来作为英国工业革命骨干的钢铁行业在那里创造了大量就业。"}

A great deal of the decades of research into ocean sound has focused on marine mammals such as humpback whales that communicate across vast distances with complex and mysterious songs.

Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner. The move is expected to reignite debate on royal succession, with the emperor also possibly abdicating soon. Ten things about Japan's emperor Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 at a restaurant, when they were both studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo. What happens now? The Imperial Household told local media that plans were under way for the princess's engagement. The engagement will only be official after a ceremonial exchange of gifts, local media said. Public broadcaster NHK said the wedding is expected to take place next year. Asked about their engagement plans, Mr Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: \"Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time.\" Has this ever happened before? Yes, Princess Mako's aunt Princess Sayako married a commoner in 2005 - the first time a Japanese royal became a commoner. Her wedding to an urban planner for the Tokyo city government, was described as a low key event. And Sayako was left to adjust to her more humble surrounding. She moved into a one-bedroom apartment, had to learn how to drive, shop in a supermarket and buy furniture. Princess Sayako is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito. How does this affect the royal family? Emperor Akihito, 83, hinted last August that he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties. No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it, but Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate. However, the new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law - which has been at the centre of debate for many years. Because of that law there are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito. After news of Princess Mako's upcoming engagement broke, Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: \"There is no change in our view to proceed with consideration of steps to ensure stable imperial succession.\"", "summary": "日本皇室成员真子公主（Princess Mako）将和一位平民结婚，她也将因此失去皇室地位。"}

The dramatic overnight escape happened in southern Songkhla province, immigration officials said. The inmates used broken tiles to dig through their cell walls. \"Twenty are still at large,\" a senior police official at the detention centre told Reuters. \"Heavy rain helped to mask the loud escape noises.\" He said checkpoints had been set up along the border. Many Uighurs flee to South-East Asia seeking to travel on to Turkey. There was an outcry when Thailand returned more than 100 Uighurs to China in July 2015.

A Malaysian woman, 69, an Irish woman, 57, and a British woman, 30, were rescued from the house on 25 October. A man, 73, and woman, 67, were held in Lambeth and bailed until January. Delayed arrest The women, who are said to be \"highly traumatised\", were found following delicate phone conversations between the charity and the 57-year-old, who had secretly gained access to a phone. There followed a number of phone conversations over a week, and the three woman eventually left the property when the owners of the house were not around, the charity said. They were met by police and representatives from the group, and were then moved to a safe location. The 30-year-old had spent her whole life in captivity. Officers are trying to establish whether she was born in the house. Police said the relationship between the women was being investigated. Det Insp Kevin Hyland, from the Metropolitan Police's Human Trafficking Unit, said: \"We have seen some cases when people have been held for 10 years, but we have never seen anything of this magnitude before.\" He added that the women had controlled lives and spent most of it indoors, but they had some freedom. Mr Hyland said: \"The women were released as soon as possible. \"There was a delay in the arrest. This was down to the fact that we had to work very carefully with these people who were highly traumatised and it was very difficult to establish the facts. \"The last thing we wanted to do was increase that trauma.\" Police said the facts behind the situation were being slowly established as specialist workers were assisting the women. Officers said there was no evidence of sexual abuse. \"A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity was the catalyst that prompted one of the victims to call for help,\" Mr Hyland said. 'Ordinary' street The phone call to the charity was made by the Irish woman on 18 October who said two others were being held with her. The charity contacted the police the same day and the information was passed on to the Met Police's Human Trafficking Unit on 21 October. Further inquiries revealed the location of the house, and after \"sensitive negotiations\" by the charity the women agreed to meet with police at a location on 25 October. The Irish woman and the British woman met the police and charity workers and showed the officers where they were being held. The 69-year-old Malaysian woman was rescued from the house and the trio were taken to a safe place. Police said the two people arrested were not British nationals and it was \"very unlikely\" that the alleged victims were related to the suspects because of their nationalities. Speaking to the BBC, Aneeta Prem, founder of Freedom Charity, said it was investigating how the women had remained hidden for so long. \"In a very busy capital city we often don't know our neighbours. We're looking at people who were kept against their will in an ordinary residential street in central London,\" she said. 'Incredibly brave' Ms Prem said of the initial contact with the Irish woman: \"She said she had been held against her will. \"She was able to use a phone but that was done in a very secret way, the people in the house didn't know she had it. \"It was a process of just over a week where there was lots of phone calls and they gained the trust of the charity, and by doing that they felt confident to reveal enough information, and obviously the police were involved, and they managed to walk out of the house when nobody was around. \"We were waiting for them with the police and we managed to get them to a place of safety. \"They have absolutely nothing now and as a charity we're trying to support them. \"It was a very emotional time, when we got the message they were outside the front door the whole call centre erupted in cheers and there were tears, and everyone was incredibly emotional to know we had helped to rescue three ladies who had been held in such horrific conditions.\" Ms Prem said the two people arrested were considered the \"heads of the family\".

Taken together, these areas account for a little over 35% of China's entire land carbon \"sink\", the group says. The researchers' analysis, based on ground and satellite observations, is reported in Nature journal. A carbon sink is any reservoir - such as peatlands, or forests - that absorbs more carbon than it releases, thereby lowering the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. China is the world's biggest source of human-produced carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. But it recently stated an intention to peak those emissions before 2030 and then to move to carbon neutrality by 2060. The specifics of how the country would reach these goals is not clear, but it inevitably has to include not only deep cuts in fossil fuel use but ways also to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. \"Achieving China's net-zero target by 2060, recently announced by the Chinese President Xi Jinping, will involve a massive change in energy production and also the growth of sustainable land carbon sinks,\" said co-author Prof Yi Liu at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. \"The afforestation activities described in [our Nature] paper will play a role in achieving that target,\" he told BBC News. China's increasing leafiness has been evident for some time. Billions of trees have been planted in recent decades, to tackle desertification and soil loss, and to establish vibrant timber and paper industries. The new study refines estimates for how much CO2 all these extra trees could be taking up as they grow. The latest analysis examined a host of data sources. These comprised forestry records, satellite remote-sensing measurements of vegetation greenness, soil water availability; and observations of CO2, again made from space but also from direct sampling of the air at ground level. \"China is one of the major global emitters of CO2 but how much is absorbed by its forests is very uncertain,\" said the IAP scientist Jing Wang, the report's lead author. \"Working with CO2 data collected by the Chinese Meteorological Administration we have been able to locate and quantify how much CO2 is absorbed by Chinese forests.\" The two previously under-appreciated carbon sink areas are centred on China's southwest, in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces; and its northeast, particularly Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. The land biosphere over southwest China, by far the largest single region of uptake, represents a sink of about -0.35 petagrams per year, representing 31.5% of the Chinese land carbon sink. A petagram is a billion tonnes. The land biosphere over northeast China, the researchers say, is seasonal, so it takes up carbon during the growing season but emits carbon otherwise. Its net annual balance is roughly -0.05 petagrams per year, representing about 4.5% of the Chinese land carbon sink. To put these numbers in context, the group adds, China was emitting 2.67 petagrams of carbon as a consequence of fossil fuel use in 2017. Prof Paul Palmer, a co-author from Edinburgh University, UK, said the size of the forest sinks might surprise people but pointed to the very good agreement between space and in situ measurements as reason to have confidence in the analysis. \"Bold scientific statements must be supported by massive amounts of evidence and this is what we have done in this study,\" the NERC National Centre of Earth Observation scientist told BBC News. \"We have collected together a range of ground-based and satellite data-driven evidence to form a consistent and robust narrative about the Chinese carbon cycle.\" Prof Shaun Quegan from Sheffield University, UK, studies Earth's carbon balance but was not involved in this research. He said the extent of the northeast sink was not a surprise to him, but the southwest one was. But he cautioned that new forests' ability to draw down carbon declines with time as the growth rate declines and the systems move towards a more steady state. \"This paper clearly illustrates how multiple sources of evidence from space data can increase our confidence in carbon flux estimates based on sparse ground data,\" he said. \"This augurs well for the use of the new generation of space sensors to aid nations' efforts to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.\" Prof Quegan is the lead scientist on Europe's upcoming Biomass mission, a radar spacecraft that will essentially weigh forests from orbit. It will be able to tell where exactly the carbon is being stored, be it in tree trunks, in the soil or somewhere else. Another future satellite project of note in this context is the planned EU Sentinel mission (currently codenamed CO2M) to measure CO2 in the atmosphere at very high resolution. Richard Black is director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a non-profit think-tank working on climate change and energy issues. He commented: \"With China setting out its ambition for net zero, it's obviously crucial to know the size of the national carbon sink, so this is an important study. \"However, although the forest sink is bigger than thought, no-one should mistake this as constituting a 'free pass' way to reach net zero. For one thing, carbon absorption will be needed to compensate for ongoing emissions of all greenhouse gases, not just CO2; for another, the carbon balance of China's forests may be compromised by climate change impacts, as we're seeing now in places such as California, Australia and Russia.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.", "summary": "中国大举植树造林的政策很可能在减小冲击全球气候的事务上担当重要的角色。"}

So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'\" He described himself as a \"typical 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going 'life is great', or 'life is fine' and that was exactly it. \"And then [I] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with.\" He said he decided to act after his brother - the Duke of Cambridge - told him: \"Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you.\" Prince Harry opened up to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon over a cup of tea at Kensington Palace during a half-hour interview recorded for a podcast on mental health issues. Gordon, who has previously spoken of her own struggles with bulimia, alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, said the pair had been alone in the room. She said it had been unusual to hear a royal talk for half an hour on any subject and described Prince Harry as \"really articulate and a sound guy\". Prince Harry said: \"Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before. \"You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip.\" 'Let out aggression' Asked whether he had counselling, he said: \"I've done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times, but it's great.\" But he said he could \"safely say\" his concerns were not related to his service as a soldier in Afghanistan. On taking up boxing, Prince Harry told the paper: \"Everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it's a really good way of letting out aggression. \"And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone.\" Prince Harry said: \"Because of the process I have been through over the past two-and-a-half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else.\" A two-part series, Mind Over Marathon, starts on BBC One at 2100 BST on Thursday 20 April, as part of a Minds Matter series of programming about mental health issues.

O'Neal, 72, had an 18-year relationship with Fawcett. The Love Story actor told the jury in Los Angeles: \"The painting is mine.\" The portrait is one of a pair created by Warhol in 1980, when he took Polaroid photos of the actress and added splashes of colour to a monochrome canvas. One version is currently on display at the university's Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, while O'Neal has hung the other over the bed at his Malibu beach house. Farrah Fawcett, who died after a three-year battle with cancer in 2009, aged 62, attended the University of Texas in the 1960s. O'Neal was sued by the university, which wants to display the paintings together, in 2011 after the portrait was spotted in the actor's home during an episode of reality TV show Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals. He has since countersued, asking for a tablecloth that Warhol drew hearts on and addressed to him and Fawcett to be returned. The actor read a letter Fawcett wrote to the couple's son, Redmond, who was born in 1985. O'Neal was also asked by the University's lawyer David Beck to read passages from his 2012 memoir Both of Us. Mr Beck questioned O'Neal about Fawcett catching him in bed with another woman in 1997, an incident the lawyer said had changed the pair's relationship. O'Neil said the following year he asked Fawcett to take the Warhol portrait hanging over his bed. \"I asked her to keep the portrait with her, store it for me, because my young (girlfriend) was uncomfortable with Farrah staring at her,\" he told the court. It then remained at Fawcett's home until her death in June 2009. Mr Beck questioned whether the actor had ever discussed removing the portrait with anyone, including a trustee charged with carrying out Fawcett's final wishes. O'Neal, who removed the portrait outside her bedroom, said: \"Of course I did. I'm sure I did. It wasn't a secret.\" He told jurors that if he is allowed to keep the Warhol portrait, he will never sell it, and that his estate documents call for it to be passed down to Redmond O'Neal. According to O'Neal, Fawcett had accepted his proposal of marriage shortly before her death. Lawyer Beck challenged the actor over how the portraits originated, suggesting that Warhol had approached Fawcett directly. However O'Neal said Warhol had asked him in 1980 whether Fawcett would be interested in being the subject of a portrait and that she had agreed. The actor said he had requested two versions, since he and Fawcett had separate homes. He said Warhol made the portrait within two weeks of a brief photo shoot with Fawcett in his New York studio. He told the court: \"It didn't take long. Doing her hair took longer than taking the pictures.\" Mr Beck asked why there was no mention of a deal with Warhol in a journal kept by O'Neal, but the actor said some of his journal from that time had been lost. O'Neal's lawyer Marty Singer said he expects to call the actor back to give evidence later in the trial.", "summary": "美国加利福尼亚州一家法院裁定，好莱坞老牌演员瑞安·奥尼尔（Ryan O'Neal）可以合法持有其女友，已故女星费拉·福赛特（Farrah Fawcett）的一幅遗像。"}

The site was opened in 2018 to help the Koreas - officially in a state of war - to communicate. It had been empty since January due to Covid-19 restrictions. In a statement, South Korea warned it would \"respond strongly\" if the North \"continues to worsen the situation\". The destruction of the office, it said, \"abandons the hopes of everyone who wanted the development of inter-Korean relations and peace settlement in the Korean Peninsula\". \"The government makes it clear that all responsibility of this situation lies in the North.\" Russia expressed concern at the renewed tensions between the Koreas. \"We call for restraint from all the sides,\" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday. Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying the Trump administration remained \"in close co-ordination with our Republic of Korea (South Korea) allies\". Tensions between North and South Korea have been escalating for weeks, prompted by defector groups in the South sending propaganda across the border. The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-jong - considered a close and powerful ally - threatened at the weekend to demolish the office. Her brother, Kim Jong-un, has ruled North Korea as Supreme Leader since 2011. There were hopes for improved relations between the North and the South and its close ally the US after Donald Trump met Mr Kim at the North-South border last June, but nothing materialised and the atmosphere has since deteriorated. North Korea is under crippling US and UN economic sanctions over its militarised nuclear programme. Washington has not yet commented on the North's latest action. Pyongyang has blamed the escalation on Seoul's inability to prevent defectors from flying anti-regime propaganda over the border. But it is likely that this is just being used as an excuse. The leafleting gives a \"cause\" for North Koreans to rally around. It was notable that once again, in the aftermath of the explosion, state media made reference to \"human scum\" - their description of North Korean defectors in the South. Kim Jong-un has failed to bring economic prosperity to his people and strict international sanctions remain in place. There are also persistent rumours that Covid-19 has affected rural parts of the country. Giving North Koreans a mutual enemy may help focus their attention elsewhere. Pyongyang is also angry at Seoul for not challenging Washington's insistence that strict sanctions should remain in place and for not pursuing inter-Korean projects which would have breached both UN and US sanctions. It feels as if North Korea could be punishing the South and with the aim of using the tension as leverage in future talks. Whatever the reason, this is a real slap in the face for a South Korean administration that pushed so hard for engagement. In recent weeks, North Korea has repeatedly condemned the South for allowing propaganda into its territory. Defector groups regularly send such material via balloons, or even drones, into the North. Last Tuesday, Pyongyang announced it was severing official communication links with Seoul, and over the weekend Kim Yo-jong threatened to send troops into the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the inter-Korean border. North and South Korea are technically still at war because no peace agreement was reached when the Korean War ended in 1953. What is the Kaesong liaison office? The border town of Kaesong has for years been a symbol of the fragile relationship between North and South Korea. In 2003, it sprung to life as the site of an industrial zone - the Kaesong Industrial Complex - set up between the North and South. At its peak, it saw more than 120 factories, employing more than 50,000 North Koreans and hundreds of managers from the South. But in 2016 it was shut down after tensions reached a head - bringing to a halt a symbol of co-operation. So, in 2018, it looked as though things were back on track when both Koreas agreed to set up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong. It allowed officials from the North and South to communicate regularly for the first time since the Korean War, and was meant to be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. But in March 2019, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from the office - following a failed summit between the US and North Korea. Who is Kim Yo-jong? In recent years the younger sister of Kim Jong-un has emerged as a powerful ally. From 2014, Kim Yo-jong's main job was to protect her brother's image, taking up a key role in the party's propaganda department. When, in 2017, she was elevated to an alternate member of the politburo, it seemed to indicate a shift in seniority - although her main role remained in propaganda. In 2018, she shot into the international spotlight when, at the Winter Olympics, she became the first member of the Kim family to visit South Korea. Her continued rise shows she has gained the deep trust of her brother, and when Mr Kim's disappearance in April prompted questions about his health, she was mentioned as a possible successor. In recent weeks, she has been responsible for delivering several strongly-worded messages against the South - and has emerged as North Korea's new point-person on inter-Korean affairs, according to specialist site NK News. However, North Korea's power mechanisms are notoriously difficult to understand. It's therefore hard to gauge how much power - or how much of her own political network - the 32-year-old might have.", "summary": "韩国官方称，朝鲜炸毁了位于边境小镇开城的朝韩联络办公室所在大楼。"}

Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed, he said. Security forces killed two gunmen and were searching the surrounding area for accomplices, Mr Essid added. At the time of the attack, deputies in the neighbouring parliamentary building were discussing anti-terrorism legislation. Parliament was evacuated. Following the attack, Mr Essid said: \"It is a critical moment in our history, and a defining moment for our future. \"We have not established the identity of the two terrorists... Reports are not final, these two terrorists could have been assisted by two or three other operatives.\" Security operations were \"still under way\", he added. Who are the victims? According to Prime Minister Essid, 19 people were killed, although some of the countries involved have different totals: Earlier reports said that a total of 20 tourists had died, with at least 22 tourists and two Tunisians injured. Other reports suggest up to 50 could have been hurt. Italian, Polish, South African, French and Japanese tourists were among the injured, Mosaique FM radio reported. Parliament held an extraordinary session on Wednesday evening. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said: \"We are in a war against terrorism... we will fight them without mercy.\" Analysis: BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Sadly, this attack did not come out of the blue. While Tunisia has been spared the catastrophic levels of violence that have plagued other Arab Spring countries like Syria, Yemen and Libya, the country has still suffered from occasional but deadly attacks carried out by Islamist extremists. In 2013, 22 people were killed. This included a suicide bomber who attacked a beach resort in Sousse. Last year 45 people were killed and already this year the death toll has reached 23, with Wednesday's museum raid following an attack on a mountain checkpoint in February that killed 4 police officers. In all cases the perpetrators are believed to be jihadists. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to Islamic State (IS) in Syria. More than 3,000 have joined, earning themselves a reputation for ferocity both on and off the battlefield. At the scene: BBC's Naveena Kottoor in Tunis The last group of foreign tourists left the Bardo museum by bus under the watch of the Tunisian security forces and hundreds of bystanders. Traffic is flowing again, but bystanders are still here. One man told me he had come out of sadness and shock. The attack struck at both the political and economic heart of Tunisia. The museum is to many Tunisians what the Louvre is to Paris - a major tourist destination. This kind of attack on civilians is new here - the last time something similar happened was in 2002. As an act of defiance and national unity, Tunisian politicians are returning to parliament on Wednesday evening. But many Tunisians had hoped that 2015 would bring a more prosperous and stable future. Tunisia's militant Islamists: How big a threat? Anti-terror demonstrations were reported in central Tunis on Wednesday, with crowds waving flags and condemning the attack. 'Tanks rolling in' A museum employee told Reuters the two attackers \"opened fire on the tourists as they were getting off the buses before fleeing into the museum\". Eyewitness Yasmine Ryan told the BBC she saw \"helicopters flying overhead\" and \"tanks rolling in\" as the security situation unfolded. The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry and its government, which only emerged at the end of a long political transition several months ago, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. Islamist militants have tried to derail the democratic transition, which, although fragile, remains the most positive result of the Arab Spring in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. The Bardo National Museum EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini offered her condolences (in French) to the victims' families, and said the EU would \"fully support Tunisia in the fight against terrorism\". US Secretary of State John Kerry said the US \"stands with the Tunisian people at this difficult time\" and would continue to support the government's \"efforts to advance a secure, prosperous, and democratic Tunisia\". Tourism is a key sector of Tunisia's economy, with large numbers of Europeans visiting the country's resorts. In 2002, 19 people, including 11 German tourists, were killed in a bomb blast at a synagogue in the resort of Djerba. Al-Qaeda said it had carried out that attack. Concerns about security in Tunisia have increased in recent months as neighbouring Libya has become increasingly unstable. A large number of Tunisians have also left to fight in Syria and Iraq, triggering worries that returning militants could carry out attacks at home.", "summary": "突尼斯国会大厦旁的巴尔杜博物馆周三（3月18日）遭枪手袭击，造成19人丧生，其中包括17名外国游客。2名枪手被击毙。"}

The US and China have imposed border taxes on each other's goods and services as part of a trade war. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have rapidly escalated in recent weeks, mainly concerning technology firms. A number of lawsuits are reported to have been filed by carmakers in the past few days in the New York-based Court of International Trade. Mercedes-Benz in its filing accused Washington of \"prosecution of an unprecedented, unbounded, and unlimited trade war impacting over $500bn in imports from the People's Republic of China\". Tesla in its filing called the tariffs \"arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion\". Founder Elon Musk wants the tariffs cancelled along with a \"refund, with interest\" of import taxes paid, according to the filing. Chinese-owned Volvo Cars has also filed a lawsuit saying it is in favour of free trade and open markets. \"Volvo Cars strongly believes the way to reach economic growth is to reduce tariffs and harmonize international trade,\" a spokesman told the BBC. Trade war The trade war began in 2018 between the world's two biggest economies. US President Donald Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. In China, there is a perception that America is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power. Early this year the two signed their \"phase one\" deal that partially ended the dispute. Washington backed down on tariffs on $160bn in Chinese goods, particularly consumer electronics. However, tensions between the two nations have massively ramped up since. Earlier this month the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that tariffs the US imposed on Chinese goods were \"inconsistent\" with international trade rules. The WTO said the US did not provide evidence that its claims of China's unfair technology theft and state aid justified the border taxes. But the US retaliated saying that the WTO was \"completely inadequate\" to the task of confronting China. Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, America's top trade negotiator, said the US \"must be allowed to defend itself against unfair trade practices\".", "summary": "多家大型美国车企就美国政府对中国汽车零部件加征关税的政策发起诉讼。"}

The measure came as Egypt confirmed the first coronavirus case in Africa. Over 1,500 people have died from the virus, which originated in Wuhan city. The notice on Friday from Beijing's virus prevention working group was issued as residents returned from spending the Lunar New Year in other parts of China. The holiday was extended this year to help contain the outbreak. More than 20 million people live in Beijing. China's national health commission on Saturday reported 143 new deaths, bringing the toll to 1,523. All but four of the latest victims were in hard-hit Hubei province. A further 2,641 people have been newly confirmed as infected, bringing the national total to 66,492. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 500 cases in 24 countries, and three deaths: one each in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. A World Health Organization (WHO)-led mission to China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the virus - officially named Covid-19 - is spreading and its severity, director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The mission, including international experts, will also look at how and when more than 1,700 health workers contracted the virus. The team consists of 12 international members and their 12 Chinese counterparts. \"Particular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme. Africa sees its first case Egypt's health ministry on Friday confirmed the first case of the coronavirus in Africa. The ministry described the person as a foreigner, but did not disclose the nationality. It said it had notified the WHO, and the patient had been placed in isolation in a hospital. Experts had earlier warned that it may not be long before the first case was confirmed in Africa, given its increasingly close ties to China. Chinese health workers die in the outbreak Chinese officials say six health workers have died. Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China's National Health Commission, said 1,102 medical workers had been infected in Wuhan and another 400 in other parts of Hubei province. \"The duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,\" Mr Zeng said, as quoted by Reuters news agency. Local authorities have struggled to provide protective equipment such as respiratory masks, goggles and protective suits in hospitals in the area. On 7 February, the plight of medical workers was highlighted by the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who had tried to issue the first warning about the virus on 30 December. He had sent out a warning to fellow medics but police told him to stop \"making false comments\". A wave of anger and grief flooded Chinese social media site Weibo when news of Dr Li's death broke.

The \"Xi\" - in this instance - is a reference to China's leader Xi Jinping who has steadily tightened his grip over the state. Just one year ago \"Xi Jinping thought\" - an articulation of his political philosophy - was enshrined in the constitution of the Chinese Communist Party. Nothing like that has happened in a very long time. Now it's moved onto Hunan TV, China's most popular entertainment channel aimed at young people, which means that it's clearly time to ensure China's Generation Z and millennials are on board. So is it any fun? It takes the form of two rounds of quizzes and a short speech about Communist Party theories and Xi's thought, as well as a few questions thrown in about Mr Xi's personal experiences on his way to the top. \"President Xi, at the age of 15, was sent from Beijing to Liangjiahe in Shaanxi province to become a farmer. During that period of time, he was eager to acquire knowledge. He even walked 15km (9 miles) to borrow a book. What's the name of it?\" fired off the host. One contestant fired back with \"Faustus\" - no hesitation whatsoever. \"Congratulations. That's correct,\" said the host to polite applause from the studio audience. The host then read a poem Xi wrote when he was the secretary of Fuzhou city's Communist Party in the 1990s, and asked: \"Who does this poem commemorate?\" \"Jiao Yulu\" shot back the answer. Correct. Once again the contestant immediately knew Xi had once penned an ode to commemorate a dedicated party cadre in China. \"What theory is great theory?\" was a question asked by Ai Silin, who is president of the School of Marxism at Tsinghua University and invited onto the show as an expert. \"It must be a scientific theory for the people. Nowadays, it must be Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\" said another contestant who won praise for his perfect answer. The game show also plays excerpts of Xi Jinping's speeches or interviews, which are regarded as \"golden quotes\", and the participants need to finish Xi's sentences or answer related questions. Xi Jinping said in a speech, \"Marxism is very profound, but essentially it can be summarised by one sentence…\" \"Striving for the liberation of humanity,\" a contestant finished. But there is a twist for the game show participants. There is no prize at the end of this spectacle - the reward is in soaking up and displaying expertise and knowledge of Xi Jinping. There could be a prize for the audience, or so the organisers must be calculating, which is that they too will get a chance to memorise party theory and enhance their knowledge of Xi. The message is clear which is that in this day and age in China that is only going to lubricate your path to success, particularly in any public or governmental sphere. It might feel like a crude and thinly-disguised tool for propaganda but in one sense it is no different to the standard Q&A of any indoctrination process. It's a gamified extension of the slogan-chanting and praise of leaders on television - and a clear demonstration of how Mr Xi's personality cult works. Will people care? The series has five episodes covering issues from the origin of Xi's thought to what's new in it and what kind of future it is likely to create. But four days after its debut, it has failed to ignite the social imagination of Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. \"This show will definitely become highest-rated TV show,\" one Weibo user mocked. \"Anyone who had wrong answer should be re-educated to meet the requirement in the new era,\" another joked. A couple in their 60s, who wanted to remain anonymous, spoke to the BBC after watching the show. \"I can't carry on watching. You can tell those participants are so staged. They're like reciting textbooks,\" said the husband who was giggling when the show started. But his wife, a seasoned Communist Party member, had a different view: \"It's boring but meaningful. Nowadays young people barely learn any basic political knowledge. It's necessary to instil them with something valuable\". In some senses it is simply a logical extension of the industry that has emerged around Xi Thought. The show features guest speakers from the Xi Thought institutes that have sprung up across China since the end of 2017 specifically targeted at students. \"In the wake of Mao's reign, Deng Xiaoping made a decision to dissolve the rule by charismatic leader and establish a rule of bureaucratic elites, constrained by term limits. Xi has upended this decision. Since he took power, there has been a marked return to the 'cult of personality'... of the pre-reform era,\" said David Moser, an Academic Director for CET Chinese Studies. Nowadays there are plenty of tools to help leaders who want to establish a cult of personality, such as apps, mobile games and cartoons - this TV game show is just another one. \"This new cult of Xi has altered the fundamental separation of politics and entertainment in Chinese media, \" Mr Moser says.", "summary": "中国，晚饭时间，晚间新闻刚刚播完，黄金时段的电视观众们准备好开始观看真正的晚间娱乐节目。"}

Universities Minister David Willetts welcomed the finding. He said it showed that students were demanding more for the £9,000-per-year fee. The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to 142 universities across the UK, asking how many complaints and appeals they had received since 2010. A total of 120 responded. The results showed universities were upholding more student complaints than ever before. The amount paid out in compensation had also risen. The total paid since 2010 was more than £2m. Mr Willetts said it appeared that since tuition fees rose to £9,000, students were more likely to hold their universities to account when things went wrong. \"If there are more complaints because students are more aware of what they should expect of funding and are more demanding, then I think that's a good thing,\" said Mr Willetts. \"When there's a fee of £9,000, the university is obliged to show what they're doing and provide a decent service.\" Student consumers The independent adjudicator for higher education, Rob Behrens, deals with university complaints which cannot be resolved internally. He said he had also seen a rise in the smaller number of complaints which come to his office each year. In 2012, he received 2,000 complaints. \"In the last five years, we've seen a continual year-on-year increase in the numbers of complaints, often to the tune of between 20% and 25%. Very recently that has tailed off, which is encouraging,\" says Mr Behrens. \"I think the decision to raise the fees has had an impact on student thinking. Students do see themselves more as consumers than they used to. They want the best possible degree they can get.\" A large proportion of the total appeals and complaints relate to cases where students appeal against their grades. But in other cases, students complain because they are unhappy with the content or structure of their courses. The largest number of appeals and complaints in one full year was at Anglia Ruskin University, where the total in 2012-13 was 992. Among those who have complained about the university recently were a group of law students, who have just completed a three-year law degree at the university's Chelmsford campus. Several of them signed up to take a Legal Practice Course in order to become trainee solicitors. But after they paid a deposit, they were told the course would not run at Chelmsford next year and they would have to travel 45 miles to Cambridge. Online lectures They will have two days' face-to-face teaching and will have to watch the remaining lectures online rather than attending them live. One of the students, Rachel, said: \"I was in complete shock, it was just we'd always been led to believe we could just carry on and there was never any doubt, there was never any warning that this could happen. \"I don't think it's fair - we have to pay the same in tuition fees when we're receiving less for our money.\" The university has rejected the students' complaint, and they are considering whether to take it further. Anglia Ruskin did not comment on the case but told the BBC it allowed larger numbers of students to appeal than some universities. \"If anything, our process has been overly generous. With a student population of more than 31,000, our numbers are not particularly surprising,\" said a spokesman. The new Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether universities are fulfilling their responsibilities under consumer protection legislation, following a report by its predecessor body, the Office of Fair Trading. The team leader responsible for the work, Carmen Suarez, said: \"We found some evidence of practices that may actually breach the consumer protection legislation. Examples include geography students that needed to complete a field trip in order to be able to graduate and were not told the cost in advance.\" Find out more about this story on File on 4 on Tuesday 3 June at 20:00 BST on BBC Radio 4.

It said that it concurred with the \"wide scientific consensus\" that Covid-19 was not man-made or genetically modified. It then added it would \"continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan\". However, both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have since pointed strongly towards the lab accident theory without providing any specific evidence. Mr Pompeo said the evidence was \"enormous\". It is possible that there could be lines of intelligence which could be used to support that theory, but they may not be confirmed or reflect the overall balance of evidence. Diplomatic balancing act US intelligence, like other countries, has devoted extensive resources to try and understand what has been happening within China, and some of the information could be highly sensitive. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic on Monday that he did not entertain the lab theory. The World Health Organization (WHO) also says it has not received any evidence from the US to back up the lab theory. Intelligence may well point to China having tried to play down or hide details of the initial outbreak, although this is different from hiding the exact origin of the virus. However, it may well add to the confusion and suspicion. China so far does not appear willing to allow an international, transparent investigation despite growing calls for one. UK politicians and officials have been wary of speaking openly about their view of the virus origins, largely because of the risk of highlighting differences with Washington or getting into a diplomatic row with China - the latter is something the Trump administration is less concerned about, and may well positively welcome as an issue in an election year. On Monday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he would not comment on intelligence information but added that China did have to answer questions about how quickly it had reported the outbreak, and needed to be \"open and transparent\" about what it learned. UK officials also say they are unaware of a \"Five Eyes\" report that was referenced over the weekend in Australian media - Five Eyes is the intelligence alliance consisting of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The media report talked of a 15-page document detailing China's covering up of the early stages of the outbreak.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普最近公开指称新冠病毒起源于中国实验室，但美国的一些亲密盟友则更谨慎地处理这种说法。"}

The analysis, published in the British Medical Journal, argues food should be fortified with the vitamin. But Public Health England (PHE) says the infections data is not conclusive, although it does recommend supplements. These, it says, should be taken for improved bone and muscle health. The immune system uses vitamin D to make antimicrobial weapons that puncture holes in bacteria and viruses. But as vitamin D is made in the skin while out in the sun, many people have low levels during winter. Trials on using supplements to prevent infections have given mixed results, so the researchers pooled data on 11,321 people from 25 separate trials to try to get a definitive answer. The team at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) looked at respiratory tract infections - which covers a wide range of illnesses from a sniffle to flu to pneumonia. Overall, the study said one person would be spared infection for every 33 taking vitamin D supplements. That is more effective than flu vaccination, which needs to treat 40 to prevent one case, although flu is far more serious than the common cold. There were greater benefits for those taking pills daily or weekly - rather than in monthly super-doses - and in people who were deficient in the first place. Why is vitamin D important? Its main function is to regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are vital for the growth and maintenance of healthy bones, teeth and muscles. In extreme cases, low levels can lead to rickets in children - where the bones become soft and weak and misshapen as they continue to grow. In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia - causing severe bone pain and muscle aches. But there is a balance - too much vitamin D can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood which can cause heart and kidney problems. Anyone with a chronic condition or taking medication should seek advice from their doctor. One of the researchers, Prof Adrian Martineau, said: \"Assuming a UK population of 65 million, and that 70% have at least one acute respiratory infection each year, then daily or weekly vitamin D supplements will mean 3.25 million fewer people would get at least one acute respiratory infection a year.\" PHE already advises everyone to take vitamin D supplements in autumn and winter for the sake of healthy bones and muscles. They are recommended all year round for some people who get little sunlight on their skin, including people in care homes or those who cover up. However, there is considerable debate about the importance of the latest study. Prof Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at PHE, said: \"The evidence on vitamin D and infection is inconsistent and this study does not provide sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections.\" But Prof Martin Hewison, from the University of Birmingham and the Society for Endocrinology, said the findings were \"striking\". \"I agree with the authors that this study supports a new indication for vitamin D beyond its established benefits for bone health,\" he added. And the research wing of the NHS, the National Institute for Health Research which funded the study, said the findings were \"worthy of serious further debate\". Ultimately, the researcher team at QMUL want vitamin D to be added to food like in the US where milk is fortified. Prof Martineau said: \"Vitamin D fortification of foods provides a steady, low-level intake of vitamin D that has virtually eliminated profound vitamin D deficiency in several countries. \"By demonstrating this new benefit of vitamin D, our study strengthens the case for introducing food fortification to improve vitamin D levels in countries such as the UK where profound vitamin D deficiency is common.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "发表在《英国医学期刊》上的一份研究报告说，使用维生素D补充剂每年可以在英国避免大约300万起感冒病例的发生。"}

Hundreds have signed a protest petition claiming their \"basic rights\" are being denied by delays in processing visas. The UK Border Agency said applications from students would be \"worked through by the end of the summer\". 'Complete outrage' The National Union of Students (NUS) says this is becoming a \"serious problem\" and a \"complete outrage\" which puts at risk the ability of UK universities to attract overseas students. A US student, Jordan Junge, who has just finished a £17,000 masters degree at the London School of Economics, says she has been waiting for almost five months for her visa to be processed and her documents returned. The student from Colorado says that this became \"extremely stressful\" when her grandmother was taken seriously ill and her parents told her to come home. \"Even if you order a pizza from Domino's you can track its progress - but I've no idea about what's happening to my passport.\" She says that there are other students who have children that they cannot get back home to see. Ms Junge says she wanted to carry out further study at the LSE which would have involved travelling outside the UK this summer, but the uncertainty over her documents is making this \"very unlikely\". And she says that the tightening of the student visa system is putting off many other US students. Along with other students, she was particularly concerned about the inability to communicate with UKBA, and so far the information she has obtained has come via her MP. 'Deplorable service' A Canadian PhD student in Edinburgh, who submitted documents at the beginning of April, says the delays have been \"incredibly stressful and distressing\" - and she is still uncertain whether she will be able to catch her flight home in a few weeks. An online petition, signed by more than 600 people, says \"the deplorable quality of service provided by the UKBA ill befits a nation like the United Kingdom\". The overseas students who have been caught in this delay are those who have finished their courses and have put in applications to remain longer in the UK. These post-study visa applications cost more than £500 to process and require students to get their fingerprints taken and to submit their passports. The visa rules changed in April - and it has been suggested that this prompted an increase in applications ahead of the deadline which has left individuals caught in a bureaucratic backlog. A South American student, who has just finished a PhD, told the BBC that it had put students in an impossible position. He said students could not apply for jobs in the UK because they had no proof of their right to be in the country - and they could not go abroad or return home for work because they had no passports to travel. A UKBA spokesperson said: \"Students should come to the UK to study not work. That is why this April we stopped the automatic right for students to stay on and find work after their studies. \"The remaining applications will be worked through by the end of the summer and applicants will be contacted once a decision is made. \"Anyone who wishes to withdraw their application and have their documents returned can do so by contacting the immigration inquiry bureau.\" But Daniel Stevens, international students' officer for the NUS, said: \"It is clear that delays to the processing of visa applications is becoming a serious problem. \"International students are facing the direct financial and emotional costs of an under-resourced UKBA. \"Having paid thousands of pounds in visa application fees and after facing a raft of bureaucratic procedures, their applications have now been put in put in a pile with little hope of being processed in a timely manner. \"As a result, vulnerable students are now stuck in the UK unable to work, unable to go home to their families and unable to get on with their lives.\" James Pitman, UK managing director at the Study Group international education firm, said: \"We need to make the UK as appealing an education destination as possible - hold-ups like these do not help.\" Earlier this year, a group of UK universities called on the government to remove overseas students from immigration figures. But the government rejected such suggestions, saying that targets to cut immigration could be achieved without \"fiddling the figures\".", "summary": "留学英国的海外学生抱怨说，他们的护照送交英国边境管理局（UKBA）申请延长签证，却拖延近半年迟迟没有回来，让他们被困英国无法回国也不能去其他国家。"}

He said they may be concerned that an \"anonymous lynch mob will turn up online and make their lives a misery\". He told the BBC: \"I very much fear for the younger generation of writers.\" The 66-year-old said he was worried that less established authors were self-censoring by avoiding writing from certain viewpoints or including characters outside their immediate experiences. \"I think that is a dangerous state of affairs,\" added the acclaimed author, whose works include The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go. He said he was particularly troubled about young writers \"who rightly perhaps feel that their careers are more fragile, their reputations are more fragile and they don't want to take risks\". His comments come after a number of freedom of speech disputes, with writers being \"cancelled\" or facing threats to boycott their work. High-profile targets have included JK Rowling, Julie Burchill and Jeanine Cummins. Sir Kazuo, however, who received a knighthood in 2019, said he was not worried about being \"cancelled\". \"I think I'm in a privileged and relatively protected position because I'm a very established author,\" he said. \"I'm the age I am. I have a reputation. Perhaps it's an illusion but I think I'm protected.\" In a career spanning four decades, he has written eight novels and one book of short stories, combining critical acclaim with commercial success. The Remains of the Day won the Booker Prize in 1989 and was turned into a film starring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Emma Thompson. It was nominated for eight Oscars. Never Let Me Go, his dystopian drama about human clones whose organs are harvested for transplant, was also adapted for the big screen, featuring Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield. And the author, who was born in Nagasaki, Japan, but moved to England when he was five, insisted there was no subject or viewpoint he would \"shrink back from\". \"Novelists should feel free to write from whichever viewpoint they wish or represent all kinds of views,\" he said. \"Right from an early age I've written from the point of view of people very different from myself. My first novel was written from the point of view of a woman.\" A Pale View of Hills, which tells the story of a Japanese woman trying to deal with the suicide of her daughter, made an immediate impact when it was published in 1982. 'A more open discussion' \"I think there are very valid parts of this argument about appropriation of voice,\" he added, saying he believes \"we do have the obligation to teach ourselves and to do research and to treat people with respect if we're going to have them feature in our work\". He said there must be \"decency towards people outside of one's own immediate experience\". But he said: \"If I shrink back from something it's because I would doubt my ability to be able to learn enough about it, to write fairly about it. But, you know, I tend to be quite arrogant about my ability to learn about things, if I put my mind to it.\" He has called for \"a more open discussion\" about cancel culture and freedom of speech. His new novel Klara and the Sun is published on Tuesday. It tells the story of a solar-powered robot that looks, behaves and moves like a human and becomes an artificial friend to a teenage girl. 'Optimistic' about AI Set in an unspecified future, robots are as common as bicycles, and gene editing is the norm. \"It's not so much of a fantasy,\" said Sir Kazuo. \"I didn't really imagine anything. \"I haven't written one of those stories about some treacherous, sinister robot that take over the family and then all her mates take over the world. It's not one of those stories at all.\" He said he was \"quite sunny and optimistic\" that artificial intelligence, or AI, \"will bring enormous benefits\". Nonetheless, he said he does have some reservations. \"I think the point when an AI programme... can write a novel that can make me cry, that shows that we've crossed some kind of remarkable line because it shows that AI can understand human emotions and it has the capacity for empathy. \"And when it can do that, it means that it can run political campaigns, for instance, very, very powerfully, much more effectively that the various kinds of data-based tactics have done so far. \"And in fact AI could come up with the next big idea, an idea like communism or Nazism or capitalism… and what troubles me about that is that it is very difficult for humans to keep control of that situation.\" At that point, Sir Kazuo Ishiguro said, he would be out of a job, replaced by a robot.

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured when the bombs exploded at the finish line in April 2013. His lawyers admitted he played a role in the attacks but said his older brother was the driving force. The guilty conviction was widely expected. In the next phase of the trial, Tsarnaev's legal team will push for him to be given a life-in-prison sentence instead of death. His chief lawyer, Judy Clarke, specialises in defending high-profile clients facing the death penalty, including the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. Although Tsarnaev's defence team had repeatedly appealed for a change of venue, Boston is not known for its support of capital punishment. Massachusetts abolished the practice in 1984 and has not executed anyone since 1947. But Tsarnaev was convicted of federal, not state crimes. The victims Victims' profiles in full A police officer was killed in the days following the attack as Tsarnaev and his brother, who also died, attempted to flee. As the guilty verdicts were read on Wednesday, Tsarnaev kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down . Nearby, the mother of one victim, eight-year-old Martin Richard, wiped tears from her face after the verdict was read. Richard's father embraced one of the prosecutors. The governor of Massachusetts welcomed the verdict, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said: \"I hope today's verdict provides a small amount of closure\". The family of Officer Sean Collier, who was killed days after the attack, said: \"While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families.\" Tsarnaev's defence team say he took part in the bombing, but argue that his elder brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind of the attack who influenced Tsarnaev into participating. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as equal partners in a plan to \"punish America\" for wars in Muslim countries. Among the most damning evidence was a video that showed Tsarnaev placing a backpack bomb near to Martin Richard, and a statement scrawled inside the boat where he was found hiding days after the attack. At the scene: Tara McKelvey, BBC News A court official warned against emotional outbursts as the verdict was read. \"There is to be no reactions,\" he told people in the room. \"Maintain complete silence.\" People on the government's side, near the FBI agents and the Watertown, Massachusetts, police chief, had cried as they watched videos of the bombings. Today they were quiet as the verdicts were read: \"guilty, guilty, guilty\". Earlier Tsarnaev had given his lawyer, Judy Clarke, a half-fist-bump. She didn't return it. This afternoon he was more subdued. He stood and paid close attention as the verdicts were read, occasionally rocking from side to side. He put his hands in his pockets then took them out quickly. He has long lashes, and he blinked a lot. When he was led out of the room, he walked quickly, as before, but his step was less springy. \"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop,\" he wrote, as he lay wounded and bleeding inside the dry-docked boat in suburban garden. The jury was also shown a surveillance video of Tsarnaev casually purchasing milk at a nearby supermarket less than 30 minutes after the bombs wreaked carnage at the finish line. Tsarnaev is an ethnic Chechen. His family moved to the US about a decade before the bombings.", "summary": "被指控制造2013年波士顿马拉松赛爆炸案的男子察尔纳耶夫被法庭裁定犯下所有他被控的30项罪行，其中不少罪名可判死刑。"}

Mr Cameron, 49, has represented Witney since 2001, becoming Conservative leader in 2005 and PM in 2010. Laura Kuenssberg: May's takeover now complete Speaking in his constituency, he said it had been a \"great honour\" to be an MP for the area, but said it would be difficult for him to remain on the backbenches without becoming \"a big distraction and a big diversion\" from the work of the new government. He denied his announcement was related to the government's moves towards allowing new grammar schools, a policy he rejected as PM. He said the timing was coincidental, adding that there were \"many good things\" in the proposed education reforms. \"Obviously I'm going to have my own views about different issues,\" he said. \"People would know that and that's really the point. As a former prime minister it is very difficult, I think, to sit as a backbencher and not be an enormous diversion and distraction from what the government is doing.\" Analysis By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Friends say that David Cameron's decision has not been made in a fit of pique, he has not merely flounced out because he doesn't like what his successor is doing. But there was a \"very real danger\", particularly because he does not support the UK leaving the European Union, that anything he said, any comment he made could \"drive a real wedge\" between him and the government which could make life harder for Theresa May. It is not that surprising that the man who used to be in charge has decided to go. But his departure adds to the sense that May's Downing Street feels more like a new administration after a general election than a continuation of David Cameron's tenure - \"it IS a new government\", one senior Tory told me, \"not everyone has understood that yet\". Read more from Laura Mr Cameron said Mrs May - his former home secretary - had been \"very understanding\" when he told her of his decision. Asked about his legacy, and whether he would be remembered as the prime minister that took the UK out of the European Union, he said he hoped his tenure would be recalled for a strong economy and \"important social reforms\" and that he had transformed a Conservative Party that was \"in the doldrums\" into a \"modernising winning force\". Mr Cameron won a 25,155 majority in 2015 in Witney, which has been held by the Conservatives since 1974. He said he had not made any \"firm decisions\" on what to do next, adding that he wanted to continue to contribute to public life. Mrs May said: \"I was proud to serve in David Cameron's government - and under his leadership we achieved great things. Not just stabilising the economy, but also making great strides in delivering serious social reform.\" She pledged to continue with his \"one-nation government\" approach. David Cameron factfile Ex-Chancellor George Osborne said he was sorry his \"great friend\" was stepping down. \"We came into Parliament together, had a great partnership and I will miss him alongside me on the green benches over the coming years,\" he added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wished David Cameron \"all the best for the future\", adding he got on well with him on a \"human level\". Speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton, Mr Corbyn said: \"We should respect people who move on to do something else with their lives. I want to wish him all the best for the future.\" But Labour's Angela Eagle declined to add her voice to the tributes, telling the BBC Mr Cameron had \"put his whole country at risk to settle a debate in his own party\" through the EU referendum. \"He has now walked away leaving others to clear up the mess.\" Ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister in coalition, said Mr Cameron had shown \"great skill\" in negotiating and listening to other views during their time in government. Mr Clegg's successor as Lib Dem leader Tim Farron added: \"He has lots of things that he should be proud of but sadly his legacy will be one of accidentally removing us from our closest friends and neighbours in Europe.\" Former cabinet minister Ken Clarke told the BBC: \"I'm a friend of David's, so I regret to say, I think for history his legacy will be he's the man who accidentally caused Britain to leave the European Union. \"There's no getting away from the fact that that will overshadow every other feature of his premiership.\" Mr Cameron initially became prime minister in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, before securing an overall majority in 2015. He pressed ahead with his pledge to hold a referendum on the UK's EU membership - campaigning hard for a Remain vote and warning of the economic and security consequences of Brexit. But he finished on the losing side, announcing his resignation the day after the vote, saying outside Downing Street that \"fresh leadership\" was needed. At the time, he said he would continue as an MP until the next general election.

Her visit to Oslo is part of a tour of Europe, her first since 1988, which she began in Geneva, at the UN's International Labour Organisation. On Saturday, Suu Kyi will meet members of the Burmese community who are exiled and now live in Norway. Open door Opening the ceremony in Oslo, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjorn Jagland, said: \"Dear Aung San Suu Kyi, we have been waiting for you for a very long time. However we are well aware that your wait has been infinitely trying for you and one entirely of a different nature from ours. \"In your isolation you have become a moral voice for the whole world.\" Mr Jagland described her as \"a precious gift to the world community\". In her Nobel lecture, Ms Suu Kyi said she heard she had received the prize on the radio and it had felt \"unreal\". But at the same time, it had \"opened a door in my heart\". \"Often during my days of house arrest it felt as though I were no longer a part of the real world,\" she said. Winning the Nobel Peace Prize \"made me real once again. It had drawn me back into the wider human community\". And she added, the Nobel Peace Prize drew the attention of the world to the struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma. \"We were not going to be forgotten.\" She described recent reforms in Burma as positive but warned against blind faith. \"My party, the National League for Democracy, and I stand ready and willing to play any role in the process of national reconciliation,\" she said. And she urged the unconditional release of all political prisoners, saying \"one prisoner of conscience is one too many\". Aung San Suu Kyi referred to Burma's ethnic conflicts and ended by saying that receiving the Nobel Peace Prize had strengthened her faith to work for peace. The two-week-long trip - seen as another milestone for Burma's political progress - includes visits to the UK, Switzerland, Ireland, France and Norway. It is her second recent overseas trip, after visiting Thailand in May. Her decision to travel is seen as a sign of confidence in the government of President Thein Sein, who has pursued a course of reform since coming to power last year, in Burma's first elections in 20 years. Ms Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of Burmese independence leader Aung San, who was assassinated in 1947. She became the leader of Burma's pro-democracy movement when, after living abroad for many years, she returned to Burma in 1988, initially to look after her sick mother.

The sons of three cabinet ministers were among more than 50 detained in raids last month. The government appears to be hitting back by sacking or reassigning hundreds of police, correspondents say. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently accused the police and judiciary of a \"dirty plot\" to undermine his administration. He was forced to carry out a cabinet reshuffle after three of his ministers resigned following their sons' arrests. In the latest development, the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), which appoints senior members of the judiciary, has said it will investigate prosecutors Zekeriya Oz, Muammer Akkas, Turan Colakkadi and Istanbul's newly appointed police chief Selami Altınok, reports say. 'Political plotting' The latest round of police dismissals was carried out under a government decree published at midnight. Those removed from their posts include chiefs of the financial crimes, anti-smuggling and organised crime units, the private Dogan News Agency reported. Many were reassigned to traffic or local duties. The move comes as the government is trying to contain the political fallout from the corruption inquiry. The mass arrests were carried out as part of an inquiry into alleged bribery involving public tenders, which included controversial building projects in Istanbul. Many believe the arrests and subsequent police dismissals reflect a feud within Turkey's ruling AK Party - between those who back Mr Erdogan and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, an influential Islamic scholar living in self-imposed exile in the US. Members of Mr Gulen's Hizmet movement are said to hold influential positions in institutions such as the police, the judiciary and the AK Party itself. For years, Mr Gulen's loyalists (known as Gulenists) broadly lined up with Mr Erdogan, sharing his belief of a greater role for Islam in Turkey's secular state, says the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul. The movement helped Mr Erdogan to win three general elections. Crucially, an undeclared Gulenist network in the judiciary and the police helped the government to remove the military from politics, our correspondent says. But many in Turkey believe that the Gulenist network has now gone after the prime minister's allies because it is unhappy with the way Mr Erdogan dealt with anti-government protesters in Gezi Park. It is also said to be angered by government plans to close a number of Hizmet-run schools - a charge the movement itself denies. Turkey's army has said it does not want to get involved in political arguments, in response to rumours of a coup plot. The corruption inquiry continues, with Turkish media reporting at least 27 more arrests on Tuesday linked to allegations of rigging of tenders at a port in the province of Izmir. Officials of the state railway company are reported to be among those detained. 'Smear campaign' The scandal has prompted anti-government protests in Turkey's main cities in recent weeks but Mr Erdogan has pledged to fight on in what is seen as the biggest challenge to his government in his 11 years in office. He has called the corruption investigation a \"smear campaign\" and urged his supporters to vote for his AK Party in upcoming local elections. Turkey's lira has fallen to a new low against the dollar. The European Union - which Turkey hopes to join - has urged Ankara to address the corruption allegations in an \"impartial manner\".

If confirmed, Mr Jo would be the most senior defector since 1997. However there is concern for his teenage daughter, who is said to have returned to the North. Italy's foreign ministry says she was repatriated to the North in February 2019 at her own request after her parents went missing. How did Jo Song-gil defect? He disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in November 2018, just before his term as North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy was due to end. Reports at the time said the diplomat - the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials - was seeking asylum under the protection of Western governments. On Tuesday an opposition South Korean lawmaker said on Facebook that Mr Jo was in the South with his wife and living under protection. On Thursday Jeon Hae-cheol, chairman of the National Assembly's intelligence committee, confirmed this was the case. \"Former acting Ambassador Jo came to South Korea voluntarily in July 2019,\" Mr Jeon said, adding: \"He had repeatedly expressed his wish to come to South Korea.\" The country's intelligence agencies have not yet commented. What about his daughter? Little is known about her other than that she is a teenager. Mr Jeon said Mr Jo had wanted his whereabouts kept secret. \"He was concerned for his family remaining in North Korea,\" Mr Jeon said, in quotes carried by Yonhap news agency. Another former North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong-ho - Pyongyang's former deputy ambassador to the UK who defected to South Korea in 2016 and is now a lawmaker there - said relatives of a defector could face retribution. \"Where a defected diplomat lives determines the levels of treatment or punishment to be given to his relatives left in the North. \"If he takes asylum in South Korea, he is defined as a traitor, apostate,\" Mr Thae said, adding: \"And no one knows what penalties would be imposed on the family members of a traitor.\" Another opposition lawmaker, Cho Tae-yong, who is also a former deputy national security advisor, accused the government of leaking information about Mr Jo and described it as an \"act that completely lacked humanitarian considerations regarding his daughter\". However Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has said she was \"surprised\" at news of Mr Jo's whereabouts and shared concerns for his daughter.

The protein has been shown to slow the onset of dementia and even repair some of the damage it causes in mice. Prof Giovanna Mallucci, who runs the UK Dementia Research Institute's Centre at the University of Cambridge, says the discovery could point researchers towards new drug treatments which may help hold dementia at bay. The research - although promising - is at an early stage, but it centres on the hibernation ability that all mammals retain, which is prompted by exposure to cold. There are already more than a million people with dementia in the UK and the total is expected to double by 2050. Researchers are searching for new ways to treat the condition, as current options have only limited impact. Bears and hedgehogs Doctors have known for decades that cooling people down can - in certain circumstances - protect their brains. People with head injuries and those who need cardiac operations are often cooled during surgery, as are babies. What has not been so well understood was why cold has this protective effect. The link with dementia lies in the destruction and creation of synapses - the connections between cells in the brain. In the early stages of Alzheimer's and other neuro-degenerative diseases, these brain connections are lost. This leads to the cascade of symptoms associated with dementia - including memory loss, confusion and mood swings - and, in time, the death of whole brain cells. What intrigued Prof Mallucci was the fact that brain connections are lost when hibernating animals like bears, hedgehogs and bats bed down for their winter sleep. About 20-30% of their synapses are culled as their bodies preserve precious resources for winter. But when they awake in the spring, those connections are miraculously reformed. Why getting cold can be dangerous Cold has a powerful effect on the human body. The shock of entering cold water causes a dramatic rise in heart rate and blood pressure, which can cause heart attacks and strokes in those with underlying illnesses. It also prompts a gasp reflex and rapid breathing, which can lead to drowning if water is inhaled. The longer someone spends in the water, the slower their responses. People can become confused and clumsy, and find it hard to get out of the water. Dr Heather Massey of Portsmouth University's Extreme Environments Laboratory, says there are some key things to remember. But Dr Massey says don't take a hot bath or shower. Changes in your blood pressure as you are re-warming, can cause you to faint and risk traumatic injury. 'Cold-shock' chemicals The Cambridge dementia team discovered the \"cold-shock chemicals\" that trigger the process in 2015. They cooled ordinary mice, and mice with Alzheimer's disease and prion (neuro-degenerative) disease, to the point where they became hypothermic, which means their body temperature was below 35C. On re-warming, they found only the ordinary mice could regenerate their synapses; the Alzheimer's and prion mice could not. At the same time, they found levels of a \"cold-shock\" protein called RBM3 soared in the ordinary mice, but not in the others. It suggested RBM3 could be the key to the formation of new connections. They proved the link in a separate experiment which showed brain cell deaths in Alzheimer's and prion disease could be prevented by artificially boosting RBM3 levels in mice. It was a major breakthrough in dementia research, and their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature. Winter swimmers Prof Mallucci believed a drug which prompted the production of RBM3 might help slow - and possibly even partially reverse - the progress of some neuro-degenerative diseases in people. RBM3 had not been detected in human blood, so the obvious next step was to find out whether the protein is present in the human population. In an interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme, Prof Mallucci explained that she would like to test the role of RBM3 in humans - but that ethical guidelines would make it very hard to get permission to make people hypothermic. Step forward Martin Pate, one of a small group who swim throughout the winter at the unheated open-air lido on Hampstead Heath in London. He and the other swimmers voluntarily made themselves hypothermic on a regular basis he told her in an email, and would therefore be ideal subjects of a study. Prof Mallucci agreed, and during the winters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, her team tested for the protein in winter swimmers. The researchers used members of a Tai Chi club who practise beside the pool but never actually swim, as a control group. The Cambridge team found that a significant number of the swimmers had markedly elevated levels of RBM3. All of them become hypothermic, with core temperatures as low as 34C. None of the Tai Chi group showed an increase in RBM3 levels or experienced these very low body temperatures. Could cold slow dementia? The Cambridge work on winter swimmers has been shared in online lectures but has not yet been published in a scientific journal. A number of other researchers have found similarly higher levels of RBM3 in babies and heart and stroke patients who have been made hypothermic. What these findings show, says Prof Mallucci, is that - just like hibernating mammals - human beings produce the \"cold-shock\" protein. But the risks associated with getting cold outweigh any potential benefits, so cold water immersion is certainly not a potential dementia treatment, she says. The challenge now, she says, is to find a drug that stimulates the production of the protein in humans and - more important still - to prove it really does help delay dementia. Dementia is predominantly a disease of the old, so even a relatively short delay in the onset of illness could have huge benefits for individuals, and the wider population. Prof Mallucci says: \"If you slowed the progress of dementia by even a couple of years on a whole population, that would have an enormous impact economically and health-wise.\"", "summary": "英国剑桥大学研究人员发现，冬泳可能有助于保护大脑免受诸如失智症（俗称老年痴呆症）等神经退化性疾病的影响。"}

Greece is now likely to be given three months to rectify the situation. If it does not improve, the EU may recommend that other Schengen states reintroduce temporary border controls. The Greek government has hit out at what it called the EU's \"blame games\", criticising the lack of \"common action\" by European countries to respond to the migrant crisis. More than 850,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Greece last year. A further 44,000 have reached the Greek islands since the start of 2016, mostly arriving on Lesbos, Samos and Chios from the Turkish mainland. There is growing pressure on Athens to deal with the flow of migrants, most of whom go on to travel through Europe to countries such as Germany and Sweden. Several EU states, including Austria and Hungary, have already introduced temporary border controls, as the principle of passport-free travel comes under increased strain. Schengen: Controversial EU free movement deal explained Migrants feel chill as Europe tightens frontier checks Which countries are in the Schengen zone? On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels that the \"draft report concludes that Greece seriously neglected its obligations\" under the Schengen agreement. He said there were \"serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border controls that must be overcome and dealt with by the Greek authorities\". Spot checks by EU inspectors in November found Greece was failing to register arrivals properly, to fingerprint everyone, to see whether identity documents were genuine, and to check people against Interpol and other databases. EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos conceded that Greece had \"started undertaking efforts towards rectifying and complying with the Schengen rules\" since then. However, \"substantial improvements\" were needed. Responding to the draft report, the Greek government said it was \"not constructive to isolate Greece for creating a media impression\", based on outdated information. A spokeswoman said Greece had repeatedly asked for help from the EU's border force Frontex to boost controls, but that the response had been \"small\". Criticising a lack of EU progress on the crisis, she said: \"Greece has done more than it could to stand to its obligations. We expect from everyone else to do the same.\" Serious warning The report must be approved by other Schengen members before the Commission can set the three-month deadline. But this is a serious warning to Greece to improve things, says the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels. Otherwise, border checks to limit the movement of migrants within Europe may be instituted, preventing those in Greece from travelling north. Timing is crucial - by the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels The prospect of many thousands more refugees and migrants coming this summer is what's worrying the countries they head for, primarily Austria, Germany and Sweden. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel told an audience on Tuesday: \"Of course we must significantly reduce the number of refugees and we are working on that.\" So it's likely Greece will now be given until mid-May to get to grips with the influx of people to its islands. And the timing is crucial. Mid-May could be when a summer surge of refugees reaching the EU is starting to peak. The temporary border controls which countries like Germany have in place will be due to expire. To prolong the controls governments will need an official assessment by the European Commission that Greece is still failing. Is EU's Schengen border-free dream at an end? On Monday, several EU states, which have already introduced temporary border controls, said they planned to prolong their restrictions for up to two years. Meanwhile the EU is said to be considering helping Macedonia, which is not a member of the EU or Schengen, to tighten security at its border with Greece. Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas condemned the proposals, warning they would trap people. \"We do not intend to become a cemetery of souls,\" Mr Mouzalas told the Financial Times (behind paywall). He also told BBC Newsnight that Belgium had told his country to \"push\" migrants \"back in the sea\" as a solution to the crisis. However, Belgian Migration Minister Theo Francken condemned the claims, calling them \"grotesque and very regrettable\". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "欧盟委员会在一份报告草案中指出，希腊“严重忽略”了其对欧盟申根区的外部边界的控制义务。"}

The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says SpaceShipTwo broke apart just two seconds after this \"feathering\" system was deployed. Why the mechanism came out when it did, the inquiry team is not yet in a position to say. But its untimely activation is now the focus of the investigation. \"This is not a statement of cause but rather a statement of fact. There is much more that we don't know, and our investigation is far from over,\" NTSB acting chairman Christopher Hart told a news conference in Mojave on Sunday. Feathering is supposed to be one of the vehicle's key safety features. The standard procedure is for the system to be deployed when the ship has reached its highest altitude, after it has broken through the atmosphere. The twin tailbooms on the craft are rotated 65 degrees, from the horizontal to the vertical. The effect is to make the returning vehicle behave much like a shuttlecock. As the air gets thicker on the descent and rushes over the booms, the drag on the plane means it naturally adopts a belly-down position ready for the glide back home - just as the feathers always ensure forward-facing flight for the conical projectile used in a game of badminton. Feathering gets around the need for a complicated system of small thrusters that would otherwise be required to put the rocket ship into the correct re-entry attitude. Importantly, that belly-down configuration also slows the vehicle's fall. The system worked to great effect on the prototype vehicle, SpaceShipOne, when it made its flights to suborbital space 10 years ago. It goes without saying that feathering a vehicle while under rocket power and moving in excess of the speed of sound is a recipe for disaster. The aerodynamic profile is utterly changed along with the forces acting on the structure of the craft. Video evidence The pilots control the descent system by means of two levers - one to unlock the system; the second to deploy it. Investigators could see from recovered cockpit video that co-pilot Michael Alsbury, who died in the accident, uses a handle to change the feathering system from the \"lock to unlock\" position as the vehicle passes Mach 1.0. Mr Hart said that this action was taken earlier than would normally be expected (it should be executed at 1.4 times the speed of sound), but there is no evidence to suggest the pilots then moved the lever that actually engages the feathering system. \"The lock-unlock lever was moved from lock to unlock, but the feathering lever was not moved. This was what we would call an uncommanded feather, which means the feather occurred without the lever being moved into the feather position,\" the investigator told reporters. Engine recovery The other key piece of information released by the NTSB concerned SpaceShipTwo's propulsion system. Much of the discussion over the weekend has focussed on the rocket engine, on its new polyamide solid fuel and the suitability of its oxidiser, nitrous oxide. Commentators have speculated whether some problem in the motor, perhaps an explosion, could have caused the accident. But the NTSB's investigations directly contradict this idea. \"The fuel tanks were found intact with no indication of breach or burn-through, and so was the engine as well,\" Mr Hart said. This was enough to prompt Virgin Galactic boss Sir Richard Branson to round on his critics. He described the speculation concerning the motor's role in the accident as \"garbage\". \"I think that what you need to do is wait for the NTSB's final statement,\" he told the BBC. \"There will be a final statement and then we'll know exactly what happened; and the rumours and the innuendoes and the self-proclaimed experts I think will be put back in their box.\"", "summary": "美国官员已经开始调查维珍银河公司（Virgin Galactic）“太空船二号”（SpaceShipTwo）在加州莫哈韦沙漠上空试飞时坠毁的事故原因。"}

The programme, which aimed to fend off the threat of eurozone deflation and help boost employment, could finish by the end of next year. Inflation is likely to be below the 2% ECB target for the next few years. The ECB said the reduced programme would run to the end of September 2018, \"or beyond, if necessary\". If economic conditions become less favourable, or if no progress is likely to be made towards the ECB's inflation target, it could increase bond-buying again, it said. \"Our programme is flexible enough that we can adjust its size smoothly,\" ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference. There will be no sudden end to bond-buying, he said. Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker The recovery in the eurozone is gaining momentum, so the ECB will ease the pressure on the accelerator a little, but only a little. The economy still needs a lot of help from the ECB's policies. The quantitative easing (QE) purchases will continue and even when they finish - next September at the earliest - the ECB will have a large stock of assets that would normally be in private sector hands. And then there are the ECB's ultra-low interest rates, with its main rate at zero and one of them below even that level. That won't change until well after the QE purchases are over. So yes, the ECB is moving its policies back towards normal. But it has a long way to go yet. The ECB kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro unchanged at 0%, and its deposit rate at -0.4%. The central bank charges banks and other financial institutions to deposit excess money with it to encourage banks to lend. \"Today's monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards [target],\" Mr Draghi said. He said the ECB will reinvest the principal investment from maturing bonds for an extended period after the end of the bond-buying programme, which could run to billions of euros per month. The decision to cut quantitative easing measures was not unanimous among ECB policymakers, and a large majority favoured keeping monetary stimulus open-ended, he said. He was asked whether the political situation in Catalonia was a threat to financial stability in Spain and in the eurozone. \"It's very very difficult to comment about developments that change every day.\" Mr Draghi said. \"Of course we are following what's happening. The importance of what's happening is significant. To conclude now there would be financial stability risks would be premature, we'll have to see what's going to happen. But rest assured, we look at that with attention. Great attention,\" he said. Markets muted Mr Draghi has been signalling for months that the bond-buying scheme will be reduced. \"Mario Draghi's main goal for months now has been to gently steer markets into thinking that this tapering would come today. He's done that so markets take the announcement in their stride, which they will,\" said Patrick O'Donnell, Aberdeen Standard Investments senior investment manager. One of the key provisions made by the ECB was the open-ended nature of the programme, said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"We do not expect a hard stop for quantitative easing in September next year, and see the ECB buying, albeit at a reduced pace of €15bn to €20bn, until the end of 2018, at least,\" he said.", "summary": "欧洲中央银行宣布将注资1万亿欧元来刺激萎靡不振的欧元区经济。"}

Under the deal, for each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, the EU is due to take in another Syrian who has made a legitimate request. Thirty-two Syrian migrants were the first to arrive in Germany from Turkey. They were flown to Hanover in Lower Saxony, officials say. The Greek authorities say 130 of those returned to Turkey on Monday were from Pakistan. There were 42 migrants from Afghanistan and others from Iran, Sri Lanka and Morocco, as well as several other countries. Two Syrians were on board, and the Greek authorities insisted that those deported only included migrants who had not sought asylum. The first returns were carried out calmly, Ewa Moncure, spokeswoman for the EU border agency Frontex, told reporters in Lesbos. Activists staged small protests there and some shouted \"No to deportations\" and \"EU, shame on you\". There was also a demonstration in Dikili. Under the EU-Turkish deal, migrants arriving illegally in Greece are expected to be sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or if their claim is rejected. Shortly after the returns started, Greek coast officials rescued two boats near Lesbos with more than 50 migrants, including children and a woman in a wheelchair, Reuters news agency says. Disputed deal Migrants in Greece have complained of a lack of information about the asylum procedure and some say they were unaware they could be returned. Frontex has been calling on EU member states to come forward with additional police officers and other staff to bring its mission in Greece up to strength. At the scene: Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Lesbos The deportations began at first light. Dozens of migrants were bussed to the port, where two small Turkish ferries were moored and waiting. Riot police were deployed to the quayside and each person being sent back had an individual police escort. But the migrants, mostly Pakistani men, did not resist. The Greek authorities say none had requested asylum. Those who have are entitled to individual hearings. The UN refugee agency says more than 2,800 people have already applied: that's almost everyone held at the detention camp here. Mark Lowen, BBC News, Dikili, Turkey Three boats docked at Dikili port, and were met by local officials and the Turkish Red Crescent. They were registered in a small tent before being driven away on buses. Along with other non-Syrians, the returning migrants will be taken to deportation centres where their cases will be assessed. Turkey has now signed readmission agreements with 14 countries. Syrians refused asylum in Greece will be taken to refugee camps in southern Turkey where, in time, they will take the place of those Syrians directly resettled in the EU under the so-called \"one-for-one plan\".

Amnesty International has accused Turkey of illegally returning Syrians to their homeland, something Turkey denies. Save the Children called the deal \"illegal and inhumane\", saying people had told them they would kill themselves if sent back to Turkey. Migrant arrivals to Greece 154,227 in 2016, up to 20 April 376 died on Turkey-Greece route 37% of 2016 arrivals are children 853,650 arrivals in 2015 Since the deal was struck in March, about 400 people have been arriving each day on the Greek islands. Tens of thousands have been stuck in Greece after northern countries closed their borders. There have been clashes in camps amid dire conditions. One million migrants and refugees have entered the EU by boat from Turkey to Greece since last year. Many are keen to travel to Germany and other northern EU countries and experts have warned the deal could force them to take alternative, more dangerous routes. In Austria meanwhile, pro-migrant protesters clashed with police at a border crossing with Italy. Austrian Defence Minister Peter Doskozil recently said soldiers would be deployed at a key transit point, saying the EU's outer borders were not properly protected. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "第一艘运载被希腊驱逐的移民的船只抵达土耳其，这是欧盟为缓解欧洲难民危机采取的一个步骤。"}

Those held helped run an unofficial \"primary\" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to \"overthrow\" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop \"external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security\". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are \"the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment\". Who was detained? Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of \"overthrowing\" the city's government. The government will not tolerate \"subversive\" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call \"white terror\" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. What were the primaries? In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion if the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo election were later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. What's been the reaction? The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. \"Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. \"I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,\" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an \"assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights\". \"The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.\" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a \"grievous attack\" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was \"being used to crush dissent and opposing political views\". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: \"The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society.\" Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now \"removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city\". \"Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,\" she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken \"the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech\" to \"another level\". \"Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people.\" Street protests a 'distant memory' By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees \"vicious plans\" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. What is Hong Kong's security law? The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under it as well as several activists who tried to flee the territory by boat last August.", "summary": "香港警方国安处本月初拘捕五十多名参加去年民主派初选的人士，这是香港《国安法》实施以来针对民主派最大规模抓捕行动， 被外界视为北京的又一举措打压民主派在香港的影响力。"}

The one that's creating the most interest is the one with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Some say President Trump is trying to raise pressure on China ahead of key mid-term elections at home in November. In the latest move, China said on Friday that it would levy new tariffs on more than 5,200 US products if the US goes ahead with its latest threat to impose 25% tariffs on $200bn (£152bn) of Chinese goods. Earlier this year, the US also started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium, including from the European Union, Mexico, and Canada. These countries have retaliated. Here are some of the main sectors finding themselves victims of the trade war so far. Cars and motorbikes The car industry seems to have been the most affected so far, with three major automakers recently warning that changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also cut its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped, as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. In May, China announced that it would cut tariffs on imported cars from 25% to 15% on 1 July in a move seen as an attempt to reduce trade tensions with the US. But shortly after, on 6 July, it increased tariffs on US-made cars to 40% in retaliation to the US's move to tax $34bn of Chinese products. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest car firm, also recently reported a loss for the first time in three years after sales slowed down in China. Among the reasons, it said many consumers had delayed purchases due to a change in Chinese import duties. European and US car companies are also responding by increasing prices in China. BMW recently said it would raise prices on two of its models from 30 July due to the increased import duty on US-made cars in China. Tesla has also reportedly increased prices on two of its models. However, there has also been a positive impact for China, as Anna-Marie Baisden, head of autos research at Fitch Solutions, points out. \"We have seen a number of carmakers, including Tesla, accelerating plans to invest in local production facilities to avoid import tariffs,\" she says. Other firms in the broader industry are also considering their options. \"Ironically some of the hardest-hit companies are American or producing in the US, even though the tariffs imposed by the US are intended to help domestic companies,\" says Ms Baisden. US motorcyle maker Harley-Davidson plans to shift some production away from the US to avoid the \"substantial\" burden of European Union tariffs, imposed in retaliation to US duties on steel and aluminium. Food and drink Some companies in the food and drinks industry are also lowering their outlooks and putting up their prices to cope with the new status quo. Tyson Foods recently cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. US spirits and wine giant Brown-Forman has said it will increase the price of Jack Daniel's and other whiskeys in some European countries, according to media reports. Coca-Cola has also said it will increase prices in North America this year to compensate for higher freight rates and metal prices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other victims Other companies are seeking to do less business with China as a way of avoiding the tariffs. Toymaker Hasbro is moving more production out of China, US conglomerate Honeywell wants to use more supply chain sources from countries outside China and home furnishing company RH expects to cut the amount of goods sourced from China, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, US equipment maker Caterpillar recently said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. World economy The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs could shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Separate releases recently showed growth in China's manufacturing sector slowing in July and one measure of US consumer sentiment falling due to tariff concerns, according to media reports. Morgan Stanley estimates that a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and them responding with similar measures. The bank said most of the effect from tariff hikes on growth would probably be seen only in 2019. Most of the impact - or almost 80% - would come through a disruption of domestic and international supply chains, the bank added.", "summary": "伴随以美国为主的贸易战不断发展，有一些公司已经感觉到疼痛。"}

These are the technologies after all that will shape the world's economic future. But is there something more? Are we witnessing the first significant engagement in something that is much more than simply a conventional trade war? For years commentators have been talking about China's rise: a shift of economic power to the East and the relative decline of the US. None of this was likely to happen without friction - but now though, the US is fighting back. Spokesmen talk about preparing for a new era of global competition. In the first instance the discussion is military - re-orientating the US armed forces away from fighting insurgencies and regional wars to prepare for state-on-state conflict, with Russia and China as the peer competitors. But in the struggle with China, the economic dimension is fundamental. At one level the Trump administration appears determined to use its economic muscle not just to constrain a company like Huawei, but also to force Beijing to open up its markets and change aspects of its economic behaviour that have long-concerned western companies seeking to do business there. Beijing, of course, sees something different going on - a developing campaign to contain China's rise. And it may be right. This battle is about much more than just business practices and commercial markets, it is a struggle over the most basic underpinnings of national power with huge strategic implications. To put it another way, the West is slowly re-learning the simple fact - one that Beijing has assimilated all too well - that economic muscle is the foundation of global power and that economic strength is the precursor of military might. It is a truism that the West has taken for granted for more than two centuries, but the development of market capitalism and the military revolutions of the 17th Century were inter-linked. It was commercial and economic power that enabled the technology for military innovation, and this, in turn, facilitated the sea-borne empires of the 17th and 18th centuries and the steam-driven empires of the 19th. When the US fully supplanted Great Britain as the dominant power in the West at the end of World War Two, for a brief moment the world had a single nuclear-armed global superpower. Of course the Soviet Union sought to rival the US in terms of its political and economic model, but it could not sustain the trappings of a military superpower over time. And with the collapse of Soviet communism, the US once again emerged as the sole global player with real military reach. This was the \"unipolar\" moment which now, in retrospect, seems all so brief. The rivalry between Washington and Moscow during the Cold War years is instructive. Not because it is a parallel for today's growing tensions between the US and China, but rather because of how different it was. There was simply no equivalent to the current economic rivalry. The Soviet Union's economy was largely cut off from the West - its technical development circumscribed and comparatively backward except in a few key areas. Western trade restrictions prevented the export of all kinds of technologies to the communist bloc. China is an entirely different matter. Its huge economy and manufacturing base are hard-wired into the international economic system. It is probably a bit late to try to shut Beijing out of key sectors of economic activity. The pace of China's rise is almost unique. Some ten years ago the US economy was still three times the size of that of China. No longer. In modern times the US has never faced an economic competitor of equal size let alone one that will out-pace it. This is entirely new. And it is, belatedly perhaps, prompting a fundamental rethink of the terms of economic competition: a rethink that puts economic power explicitly back where it always should have been, as the central foundation of national strategy and national power. This of course is something the Chinese have understood all along. Nineteenth century China was the victim of western expansionism and buccaneering trade practices. It is a history that is well-remembered there, whereas in the West, the Opium Wars or France's Tonkin campaigns - its early forays into Indo-China - are largely forgotten. China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative - its expansive plans for close economic ties with a chain of countries - was not solely about markets and access to raw materials, but reflected a fundamental strategic effort. This has been bolstered by a long-standing programme of buying up and developing essential port facilities around the globe. It was a conscious policy to secure China's economic future as the key determinant of national power. The \"Belt and Road\" initiative was undertaken with the understanding that the US and Japan would not necessarily be China's main trading partners in the long-term. China has tapped into huge markets throughout the developing world - literally billions of people. The Chinese economy may be faltering right now (at least in relative terms) but as one well-informed US China-watcher told me, \"they have engineering talent, a focused leadership, a market orientation and long-term horizons\". President Trump has seemingly decided to draw a line against Chinese competition. A variety of regulatory changes in the US seek to curtail China's access to US knowhow and critical sectors of the US economy. But will it work? Will Mr Trump himself stay the course or enact one of his customary U-turns? His recent comments on concessions regarding Huawei seem to underscore his transactional rather than strategic approach to foreign policy. But this is an issue way bigger than Mr Trump and will challenge multiple US administrations to come. That though is a short-term concern. The fundamentals of the strategic competition between the US and China are clear and are not going to go away. Efforts to decouple their two economies will cause pain in the short-term for both (and probably in the long term too). But the concern is that the worsening economic tensions are carrying over into the security realm, raising real fears of conflict, either by accident or design. Many of Mr Trump's domestic political opponents, while accepting that there is \"a China problem\", nonetheless disagree with the way he is setting about resolving it. International economic institutions need to be refreshed, they argue. Trade and security legislation need to encompass the challenges posed by new technologies like artificial intelligence. And they fear that Mr Trump is pursuing an altogether too-narrow and nationalist approach. Above all, they say, allies need to be kept on side. If this resolves down to separate economic battles between China and Japan, between China and the EU, or between China and the US, Beijing will have the upper hand. There was a time when the essential approach of the US to China's rise was to seek to make it a \"responsible stakeholder\" in the international system. It was essentially saying that China would be accepted if it played by the prevailing economic rules. But now China has risen and it is a process that will not stop. Not surprisingly it has some ideas of its own. Now much of the talk is about containing China. But this simply raises the question, is China simply too big to be contained?", "summary": "美国政府坚持说，美国反对在关键信息系统中使用华为技术，完全是出于对安全的担心——比如华为可能在其产品中安装“后门”，以及中国政府与中国高技术公司的密切关系等。"}

The fate of the camp and up to 10,000 people living there has become central to France's presidential campaign. Mr Hollande said that just because the UK had made a \"sovereign decision\" - an apparent reference to the UK's vote to leave the European Union - it was not \"absolved from its obligations to France\". He said he was determined that the UK government would support the humanitarian effort, and said his own government was committed \"until the end\". Between 7,000 and 10,000 migrants and refugees live in the Jungle amid squalid conditions, many of them hoping to enter the UK illegally by hiding on lorries crossing the English Channel.

Mr Trump labelled the anonymous writer \"gutless\" and the newspaper as \"phony\". His press secretary said the mystery writer was a \"coward\" who should quit. The Times defended the editorial in a statement, saying: \"We are incredibly proud to have published this piece, which adds significant value to the public's understanding of what is going on in the Trump administration.\" The opinion piece comes a day after excerpts of Bob Woodward's book on the Trump White House suggested that his top officials have been engaged in an \"administrative coup d'etat\" to protect the nation from the president, including removing key documents from his desk before he has a chance to sign them. This, then, presents itself as first-hand acknowledgement that the coup is real. The author says that he/she isn't a liberal operative and agrees with many of the policy goals the administration is pursuing, but that those goals are being achieved in spite of - and not because of - the president. What does the senior official say about Trump? The laundry list of criticisms should be familiar to the president's opponents on the left and the right, however. Disorganised meetings, an impetuous and petty demeanour, an inability to stick to decisions, antipathy to a free press and \"anti-democratic\" instincts. \"Many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,\" the author writes. \"I would know. I am one of them.\" \"To be clear, ours is not the popular 'resistance' of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.\" He/she describes a \"two-track presidency\", where the president's actions - such as his conciliatory attitude toward \"autocrats and dictators\", including Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin - are constrained and redirected by \"adults in the room\". \"This isn't the work of the so-called deep state,\" the author writes. \"It's the work of the steady state.\" What's more, the author says that some in the administration have whispered about invoking the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that allows the vice-president and a majority of the Cabinet secretaries to vote to remove a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". Such a manoeuvre has been, up until now, largely consigned to the fringes of American political discourse and the fever dreams of Mr Trump's angriest opponents. \"No-one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis,\" he/she writes. \"So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until - one way or another - it's over.\" How has the White House responded? There has already been talk of an aggressive push within the White House to find out the identity of the sources Woodward relied on for his book, Fear: Trump in the White House. The Times essay is throwing fuel on an already raging fire. Mr Trump took to Twitter with a simple word: \"TREASON?\" He followed it up with a tweet questioning whether the official actually existed or had been made up by the Times. He added: \"If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\" He added another tweet later, saying: \"I'm draining the Swamp, and the Swamp is trying to fight back. Don't worry, we will win!\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sent out a sharply worded official response. \"The individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected president of the United States,\" she writes. \"He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people.\" On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in India, attacked the New York Times for choosing to publish \"a disgruntled, deceptive, bad actor's word\", adding: \"It's sad.\" He said: \"I find the media's efforts... to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing.\" Amid social media speculation that Vice-President Mike Pence might be the author of the piece, his communications director, Jarrod Agen, tweeted that the vice-president \"puts his name on his Op-Eds\". Mr Agen added: \"The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts.\" Guessing game - who is the anonymous source? Outside of the administration, the essay will set off one of Washington's favourite games - guessing the identity of an unknown author. Not since \"Anonymous\" wrote the novel Primary Colors, a thinly disguised fictional account of the 1992 Bill Clinton presidential campaign, has there been a mystery like this. Primary Colors was later revealed to have been written by journalist Joe Klein. Given that much of the focus of the piece is on conduct in international affairs, the spotlight will probably shine the brightest on the president's foreign policy team - in the Department of State, National Security Council and Department of Defense. There will also surely be calls for this administration official to reveal him/herself.\"The crisis of our time is that people in positions of power see a president who shows 'a preference for autocrats and dictators' and 'anti-democratic impulses', but do not publicly stand against them, and so allow it to continue,\" tweets Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia. An anonymous confession that only confirms the fears of Mr Trump's critics is hardly a profile in courage. Following so quickly on the heels of the Woodward book, however, the New York Times essay will make for a one-two punch that will be difficult to shake off.", "summary": "特朗普政府一名不具名的高层官员撰文表示，政府内部成员正在努力阻挠总统的一部分事务进程，以保护国家不受他的“最坏倾向”影响。"}

British police declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations. Emwazi first appeared in a video last August, when he apparently killed the US journalist James Foley. He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter. 'The Beatles' In each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose. Speaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown. Earlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded. Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were known collectively as \"the Beatles\". Mohammed Emwazi timeline: Source: Cage, London-based campaign group 'Jihadi John' movement mapped Emwazi \"claimed harassment\" In a news conference, Asim Qureshi, the research director of the London-based lobby group Cage, which had been in contact with Emwazi over a number of years, explained how he had been approached by the Washington Post for the story and detailed the difficulties Emwazi had had with security services in the UK and overseas. Mr Qureshi said Emwazi, who is understood to be about 27, had been \"extremely kind, gentle and soft-spoken, the most humble young person I knew\". He said he could \"not be 100% certain\" Jihadi John was Emwazi although there were \"striking similarities\". Emwazi's difficulties began when he travelled to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation in computer programming at the University of Westminster, Mr Qureshi added. He and two friends had planned to go on a safari but once they landed in Dar es Salaam they were detained by police and held overnight. Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK. Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC News US and British counter-terrorism officials discovered the identity of \"Jihadi John\" as far back as last September. The FBI, Britain's MI5 and other intelligence agencies used a combination of voice recognition software, interviews with former hostages and on-the-ground research in London to build up a profile of the man now revealed to be Mohammed Emwazi. They have always declined to reveal the name for \"operational reasons\". Now that it's out in the public domain, it's emerged that Emwazi was well-known to MI5 and that it even tried to recruit him as an informer, years before he went off to Syria to eventually join Islamic State. The practice by intelligence agencies of approaching jihadist sympathisers to work for them is likely to continue. It's believed both Britain and the US have informers inside the Islamic State \"capital\" of Raqqa. Yet this seems to have been little help in stopping the actions of Mohammed Emwazi, or bringing him to justice.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Mr Erdogan's remark was \"way out of line\". Earlier, a rally in the city due to be hosted by the Turkish foreign minister was banned for security reasons. Turkey has summoned the Dutch charge d'affaires to the foreign ministry in Ankara for an explanation. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had been hoping to harness the votes of the Turkish diaspora in the Netherlands, home to some 400,000 Turks, ahead of a referendum in Turkey next month on whether to expand Mr Erdogan's powers. Austria, Germany and Switzerland have banned similar gatherings where Turkish officials were due to speak. Blockade at the Turkish consulate On Saturday, Turkey's family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, was stopped by police as she tried to enter the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam after arriving from Germany, where she had held separate meetings. Dutch news broadcaster NOS ran footage of the minister arriving at the consulate and being denied entry by security forces. \"We were stopped at the Consulate General of Rotterdam, 30 metres away, and are not allowed to enter,\" Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya wrote on Twitter. She travelled by land to the Dutch city after hearing that the plane carrying Mr Cavusoglu had been refused permission to land. Dutch police earlier closed the road leading to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam for security reasons. Peaceful protests in Rotterdam On Saturday evening, hundreds of people waving Turkish flags gathered outside the consulate building in protest. Dozens of supporters of Mr Erdogan stood near the entrance as police erected barriers to prevent demonstrators from getting too close. As the crowd numbers increased throughout the evening, security was stepped up and people were later dispersed. Retaliation threat President Erdogan reacted to the ban on his foreign minister by threatening to block Dutch flights. He said: \"Ban our foreign minister from flying however much you like, but from now on, let's see how your flights will land in Turkey.\" Mr Cavusoglu also warned Turkey would impose heavy sanctions if his visit were blocked. Mr Rutte warned in a statement (in Dutch) that the Turkish threat of sanctions made \"the search for a reasonable solution impossible\". Mr Rutte also stressed that Dutch officials had earlier discussed whether the planned rally with Mr Cavusoglu could be private and \"smaller-scale\" and held in a Turkish consulate or embassy. The Netherlands \"regrets the course of events, and remains committed to dialogue with Turkey,\" the statement added. Analysis - Mark Lowen, Turkey Correspondent Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a canny political operator. While his falling-out with key European allies and explosive comparisons to the Nazis may seem chaotic, it's quite possibly all planned by a man who knows he thrives as the underdog. Sending Turkish ministers to Europe when relations with Turkey are flagging and some European states are nearing elections was never going to be warmly welcomed by the German or Dutch governments. They rose to the bait - and it has allowed Mr Erdogan to paint this as a conspiracy against Turkey and himself as the nationalist Turkish hero fending off the European oppressor. That will rally his support base and the far-right nationalists he's trying to woo before the presidential referendum next month. But it will horrify the other side of Turkey - the pro-European liberals who see their country drifting ever further from the west and their President engaging in unprecedented slander against other Nato allies. What does it mean for the Dutch election? The diplomatic row comes just days before Dutch voters go to the polls. The election campaign has been dominated by issues of identity, the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says. The anti-Islam leader of the Freedom Party, Geert Wilders - who campaigned against the Turkish minister's visit - is expected to make significant gains, our correspondent adds. Row engulfs other European cities Last week, Mr Erdogan accused Berlin of \"Nazi practices\" after a number of his rallies were cancelled, drawing a sharp response from the German government. He is seeking to extend his powers in the 16 April vote and targeting millions of expatriate voters - including 1.4 million in Germany. There is uncertainty about whether an event Mr Cavusoglu was due to attend in Zurich, Switzerland, on Sunday would go ahead after one venue refused to hold it. Another event in Zurich scheduled for Friday was cancelled, as were rallies in the Austrian towns of Hoerbranz, Linz and Herzogenburg. The Dutch and Austrian governments have criticised the Turkish government's drive to take its referendum campaign to Turks based in EU countries. Relations between Turkey and European countries have deteriorated since last July's attempted coup in Turkey. Germany has been critical of the mass arrests and purges that followed - with nearly 100,000 civil servants removed from their posts. Many European nations have expressed deep disquiet about Turkey's response to the coup attempt and its perceived slide towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan. Turkey is a key partner in an arrangement attempting to limit the movement of migrants into the EU, but has threatened to \"open the gates\" if the EU reneges on commitments to provide aid, visa-free travel for its nationals and accelerated membership talks.", "summary": "由于荷兰此前取消了土耳其的一场政治造势活动，土耳其总统埃尔多安将荷兰人形容成\"纳粹残余和法西斯主义者\"。"}

On YouTube, the company behind the video clearly stated it was fiction before their account was removed. But on WhatsApp, where the video has been passed on without that clarification, some users were fooled. What's in the video? Opening with a familiar shot of the BBC newsroom, a grim-faced presenter announces a \"serious incident between Russia and Nato\". \"Although the details are uncertain, early reports indicate that a Russian surveillance aircraft was fired upon by naval vessels of Nato forces,\" the presenter says. As the report progresses, the incident escalates to the point where Russian warships have fired on Nato targets, the Royal Family has been moved, an emergency broadcast advises everyone else to stay at home and thermonuclear war erupts, destroying the German city of Mainz and part of Frankfurt. Again, this is a work of fiction. It is nicely produced, but there are several key giveaways. How can you tell it's not real? Although BBC branding is used in the video, the font, style and layout is very different. If you are sent a video on WhatsApp which appears to be from a major media organisation but you are not sure, search for it on the organisation's website. In this instance, if thermonuclear war was breaking out in much of the world and the BBC had reported on it, it is likely the news would be mentioned on the website and would be corroborated by other news organisations. Who made it and why? The video features actor Mark Ryes and was produced for an Irish company in 2016. Mr Ryes told the BBC: \"It was created by a company called Benchmarking Assessment Group as a psychometric test for their clients to see how they'd react in a disaster scenario. \"On the original YouTube posting it says very clearly that it's fictional. It doesn't even look like a genuine BBC News report. It was never meant to. \"As an actor playing this role, I recorded the video against a green screen. I had no part in the editing or production of the final piece.\" Mr Ryes sent his recorded material to David Ringwood, Benchmarking Assessment Group's head of assessment services. According to the company website, Benchmarking Assessment Group was \"founded in 2006 in Ireland\" and works with clients to develop \"methodologies in assessment for selection, development and talent management\".

IS claimed the attack on Tuesday, although did not provide evidence. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's president vowed to \"completely restructure\" state security after the attacks. In a televised address late on Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said he plans to change the heads of defence forces \"within the next 24 hours\". He also admitted threat reports had not been shared with him, and promised to take \"stern action\" against security officials. What did the prime minister say? Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks \"could not have been done just locally\". \"There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier,\" he said. Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack, all of whom were Sri Lankan nationals. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. ''We, certainly the security apparatus, are of the view there are foreign links and some of the evidence points to that. So if the IS (Islamic State) claimed it, we will be following up on this claim,\" he added. The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be \"out there\" following the attack. Who could be behind the attacks? IS said it had \"targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka\" via its Amaq news outlet. It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. He also said \"preliminary investigations\" indicated that the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. 'Targets in line with IS ideology' Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The Sri Lankan government has said locals from two known groups carried out the attack. But from the start - because of the scale and sophistication of it - they have also said they thought there was an external role. In the past, IS has sometimes claimed attacks that it was not involved in or which it simply inspired. But the details from IS would seem to back up the government's assessment. The choice of targets is much more in line with IS ideology than with the traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka. There are still questions - did the local men affiliate themselves to IS or receive direct support? Did they travel to Syria or to other countries? The Sri Lankan government has said it believes some of them had spent time abroad, but how significant was that to the plot? Answering questions like these will be important not just for Sri Lanka but other countries as they try and understand whether other relatively small, locally focused groups could be capable of transforming a threat into violence on such a massive scale. Who were the victims? The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 10 Indian nationals. The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect. Are you in Sri Lanka? Have you been affected by the attacks?

Cambridge researchers say it consumes around 121.36 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year - and is unlikely to fall unless the value of the currency slumps. Critics say electric-car firm Tesla's decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin undermines its environmental image. The currency's value hit a record $48,000 (£34,820) this week. following Tesla's announcement that it had bought about $1.5bn bitcoin and planned to accept it as payment in future. But the rising price offers even more incentive to Bitcoin miners to run more and more machines. And as the price increases, so does the energy consumption, according to Michel Rauchs, researcher at The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, who co-created the online tool that generates these estimates. “It is really by design that Bitcoin consumes that much electricity,” Mr Rauchs told BBC’s Tech Tent podcast. “This is not something that will change in the future unless the Bitcoin price is going to significantly go down.\" The online tool has ranked Bitcoin’s electricity consumption above Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh) - and it is gradually creeping up on Norway (122.20 TWh). The energy it uses could power all kettles used in the UK for 27 years, it said. However, it also suggests the amount of electricity consumed every year by always-on but inactive home devices in the US alone could power the entire Bitcoin network for a year. Mining Bitcoin In order to \"mine\" Bitcoin, computers - often specialised ones - are connected to the cryptocurrency network. They have the job of verifying transactions made by people who send or receive Bitcoin. This process involves solving puzzles, which, while not integral to verifying movements of the currency, provide a hurdle to ensure no-one fraudulently edits the global record of all transactions. As a reward, miners occasionally receive small amounts of Bitcoin in what is often likened to a lottery. To increase profits, people often connect large numbers of miners to the network - even entire warehouses full of them. That uses lots of electricity because the computers are more or less constantly working to complete the puzzles. The University of Cambridge tool models the economic lifetime of the world's Bitcoin miners and assumes that all the Bitcoin mining machines worldwide are working with various efficiencies. Using an average electricity price per kilowatt hour ($0.05) and the energy demands of the Bitcoin network, it is then possible to estimate how much electricity is being consumed at any one time. Environmental conundrum “Bitcoin is literally anti-efficient,” David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, explained. “So more efficient mining hardware won't help - it'll just be competing against other efficient mining hardware. “This means that Bitcoin's energy use, and hence its CO2 production, only spirals outwards. “It’s very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery.” The price of Bitcoin rose rapidly on Monday after Tesla announced its investment. But commentators say the investment clashes with the electric car firm's previous environmental stance. “Elon Musk has thrown away a lot of Tesla's good work promoting energy transition,” Mr Gerard said. “This is very bad... I don't know how he can walk this back effectively. \"Tesla got $1.5bn in environmental subsidies in 2020, funded by the taxpayer. \"It turned around and spent $1.5bn on Bitcoin, which is mostly mined with electricity from coal. Their subsidy needs to be examined.\" A carbon tax on cryptocurrencies could be introduced to balance out some of the negative consumption, Mr Gerard suggested.", "summary": "英国剑桥大学的分析显示，加密货币比特币一年耗费的电力超过阿根廷整个国家的用电量。"}

But it is not only the relationship between the parent and child that is important. How parents get on with each other also plays a big role in a child's wellbeing, with the potential to affect everything from mental health to academic success and future relationships. But there is the chance for some good to come out of a \"positive\" row. In most cases, arguments will have little or no negative effects for children. But when parents shout and are angry with each other, when they consistently withdraw or give each other the \"silent treatment\", problems can sometimes arise. UK and international research conducted over several decades through observations in the home, long-term follow up work and experimental studies, suggests that from as young as six months, children exposed to conflict may have increased heart rates and stress hormone responses. Infants, children and adolescents can show signs of disrupted early brain development, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, conduct disorder and other serious problems as a result of living with severe or chronic inter-parental conflict. Similar effects are also seen in children who are exposed to ongoing but less intense conflict, compared with children whose parents constructively negotiate or resolve conflicts. Nature or nurture? The impact on children is not always as might be expected. For example, divorce - and parents deciding to live apart - has often been seen as having a particularly damaging and lasting effect on many children. But in some cases, it is now thought that it could be the arguments that take place between parents before, during and after a separation that do the damage, rather than the break-up itself. Similarly, it has often been assumed that genetics play a defining role in how children respond to conflict. And it is true that \"nature\" is central to a child's mental health - playing a part in problems from anxiety, to depression and psychosis. But the home environment and the \"nurture\" they receive there can also be very significant. Increasingly, it is thought that underlying genetic risks for poor mental health can be made worse - or better - by family life. The quality of the relationship between parents appears to be central, whether or not they are living together, or if the children are genetically related to the parents or not - for example, if they were conceived using donor eggs or sperm, or adopted. Rows about children What does all of this mean for parents? First, it is important to recognise that it is perfectly normal for parents and carers to argue or disagree with each other. However, when parents engage in conflicts with each other that are frequent, intense and not resolved, children do less well. Even more so if the row is about children, for example where children blame themselves or feel at fault for the arguments. These negative effects can include sleep disturbance and disrupted early brain development for infants, anxiety and conduct problems for primary school children, and depression and academic problems and other serious issues, such as self-harm, for older children and adolescents. For decades, we have known that domestic abuse and violence can be particularly damaging for the children involved. But parents don't even need to display volatile or aggressive behaviour towards one another for damage to be done. Where they become withdrawn, or express low levels of warmth for each other, children's emotional, behavioural and social development is also put at risk. The problems don't end there. Not only are children affected in their own lives, but research shows that bad relationships can pass from one generation to the next. It is a cycle that needs to be broken if we want positive and happy lives for today's generation of children, and the next generation of parents and families. Arguing in 'private' But there are factors which can reduce the harm caused. From the age of about two - and possibly from an even younger age - research tells us that children are astute observers of their parents' behaviour. They often notice arguments - even when parents think their children don't, or believe they have protected them by arguing in \"private\". What matters is how children interpret and understand the causes and potential consequences of conflicts. Based on their past experience, children decide whether they think conflicts are likely to escalate, potentially involve them, or could even pose a risk to family stability - a particular concern for some young children. They may also worry about the possibility of their relationship with their parents worsening as a result. Research suggests that boys and girls may also respond differently, with girls at greater risk of emotional problems, and boys at greater risk of behavioural problems. Often, policies aimed at improving mental health among the young have focussed on supporting the children themselves, or in directly supporting parenting. But it could be that supporting the relationship between parents could also make a big difference to children in the short term, as well as better equipping them to form their own healthy relationships with others in the future. Where children have supportive relationships with relatives, siblings, other adults (eg teachers) and friends, these are important for children's long-term healthy development. What happens at home can significantly influence these relationships, for good or ill. It is natural for parents to feel concerned about the impact their arguments may have on their children. But it is normal to argue or disagree sometimes, and in fact children respond well when parents explain or resolve - in an appropriate way - what an argument was about. Indeed, where parents successfully resolve arguments, children can learn important positive lessons which can help them navigate their own emotions and relationships beyond the family circle. Helping parents understand how their relationships affect children's development sets the stage for healthy children today - and healthy families in the future.

In the main meeting room of the Presidential Palace in Saigon, General Duong Van \"Big\" Minh and his men were sitting in tense silence. On the big table there were glasses of water and bowls holding cashew nuts. The lunch menu that day offered two main dishes - beef tendon stewed with ginseng and fish cooked in sugar cane juice. But no-one was eating. Just a few hours before, North Vietnamese tanks had crashed through the gates of the palace. And \"Big\" Minh had delivered a surrender note on the radio as the last president of the Saigon government. Bui Tin was an army reporter and a senior lieutenant colonel with the North Vietnam army at the time, one rank below the one he would later hold when he defected to the West. Yet he was the highest-ranking officer present when his team was ushered into the room where the defeated president was awaiting to transfer power. To which he responded: \"But you have no power to transfer.\" He was feverish, almost drunk on victory. Together with millions of Northerners, he'd spent 30 years fighting for what he firmly believed was a just, sacred cause. \"Today is a joyful day, peace has prevailed. The war is ended and all Vietnamese are victors. Only the American imperialists are the vanquished,\" Mr Tin told the room. Fast forward a couple of decades, and Vietnamese communist historians deliberately omitted Bui Tin's name from their reports on that historic day. The reason was simple: Mr Tin became a dissident in exile. Post-war Vietnam was far from the communist paradise that many had imagined. As ties with traditional ally China degenerated into conflict and Vietnam found itself isolated in the world arena, Hanoi struggled with a crippled economy and a fractured society. The regime proved incapable of economic management and popular discontent soared. Bui Tin felt the anger of his countrymen but, having risen to be deputy editor-in-chief of the party mouthpiece paper Nhan Dan, he also witnessed the leadership atrophy at first hand. Invited to Paris in September 1990 to attend an annual event held by the French communist newspaper L'Humanité, he decided not to return to Hanoi. Not many had seen it coming, as he was considered a staunch communist, one of the party elite. But that's why his explosive broadcasts on the BBC afterwards shook the Communist Party's headquarters in Hanoi's Ba Dinh square. Do Van, a veteran journalist of the BBC Vietnamese Service, said: \"At the beginning of 1990, when in Hanoi on a duty trip, I began noticing his [Mr Tin's] disillusionment with the regime. \"The following November, we met in Paris. He told me he'd submitted 'A Petition of a Single, Ordinary Citizen' to the Communist Party via the embassy in Paris, in which he expressed his grave concerns about the economic and political situation inside the country. \"He asked me to broadcast it on the Vietnamese Service.\" The then-head of the Vietnamese Service, Judy Stowe, assigned Do Van to conduct a series of interviews with Mr Tin around his 12-point petition, which went on to be broadcast over six weeks. Bui Tin exposed the regime that he accused of \"bureaucracy, irresponsibility, egoism, corruption and fraud\". \"Every Vietnamese is troubled by the country's present situation,\" he said. \"There are acute economic problems, a return of galloping inflation, mounting prices and daily erosion of living conditions of civil servants and cadres.\" Bui Tin called for efforts to build \"a truly democratic regime with the people at the core\". He also petitioned to change the country's name from the Socialist Republic to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Communist Party to the Labour Party of Vietnam \"to get back to the true meaning of our battle\". But his insights into communist leaders's closely guarded private lives were what earned him the mighty wrath of official Hanoi. More lives in profile It was a journalistic coup for the BBC. Vietnamese listeners were glued to their transistor radios every night during those weeks, secretly passing around photocopied transcriptions. Bui Tin's \"Following Ho Chi Minh: Memoirs of a North Vietnamese colonel (1995)\" dealt a powerful blow to the legitimacy of the Communist Party. Until the last day of his life, Bui Tin was labelled a traitor by Vietnamese official channels. His death was not mentioned in any of the Vietnamese newspapers, not even those that he once edited. Born to a noble family during French colonial rule, Bui Tin became a Communist Party member at 19. His father was a court mandarin but later joined the nationalist Viet Minh movement led by Ho Chi Minh and eventually became chairman of the new National Assembly. Thanks to his father's close relationship with President Ho, Bui Tin had access to the Party's top echelon. He fought under the command of the national hero General Vo Nguyen Giap and got wounded during the famous battle in Dien Bien Phu which ended the war against the French. But thanks to his job as an army correspondent, he was present at many of the country's historic moments, including the departure of US troops in 1973 and the invasion of neighbouring Cambodia in 1979, when Vietnamese troops toppled the murderous Khmer Rouge. \"My father was the most dedicated journalist,\" Bui Bach Lien, Bui Tin's daughter, told the BBC from her house in Hanoi. \"He was always there in the field, covering events with the utmost passion.\" His frequent reporting trips meant Bui Tin was never around when Lien and her younger brother were growing up, but she insisted he was a \"wonderful dad\". \"He taught us about right and wrong, how we should feel about the country as a citizen,\" she said. \"He loved Vietnam.\" More on the Vietnam War Mr Tin's defection had serious consequences for his family, especially during the 1990s. They were questioned and harassed. Lien saw her father in person for the last time in 2015 during a secret visit to Paris. In one of their last telephone conversations, Lien recalled her father asking: \"Are you angry with me for all the troubles?\" Her reply was: \"Never. You are our father.\" Those who knew Bui Tin also knew he would not return to Vietnam as he wouldn't be able to speak out ever again. Yet he always dreamed about returning to the homeland. The email address Mr Tin used the longest was LienBat - the name of his ancestral village just outside Hanoi. Returning home was a far-fetched dream that died with him.", "summary": "裴信（Bui Tin）在越战时期，是北越共产党的一员，1975年北越胜利，击退美国支持的南越。但自从战争结束，他成为不受欢迎的异见人士，他的名字在越南的纪录中被抹去。裴信日前离逝，终年90岁。BBC记者范娥（Nga Pham）报道裴信的生平："}

She said her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. \"I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could,\" she wrote. Her partner, Brad Pitt, praised her choice as \"absolutely heroic\". Risk reduced Ms Jolie said the process began in February and was completed by the end of April. In an article entitled My Medical Choice, she explained that her mother fought cancer for nearly a decade and died at the age of 56. She said she had sought to reassure her children that the same illness would not take her away from them, \"but the truth is I carry a 'faulty' gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer\". She said that once she \"knew that this was my reality\", she had taken the decision to undergo the nine weeks of complex surgery required to have a double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction of the breasts with implants. \"There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful,\" she wrote. Her chances of developing breast cancer have now dropped from 87% to under 5%, she said. She praised her partner, actor Brad Pitt, for his love and support throughout the procedure, and said she was reassured that her children had found nothing in the results \"that makes them uncomfortable\". \"I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,\" she said. \"For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options,\" Ms Jolie went on to say. \"I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.\" In an interview with the Evening Standard, Brad Pitt said: \"Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find Angie's choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. \"All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family.\" Ms Jolie, an award-winning actress and director, is also a long-time supporter of humanitarian causes. She is currently a special envoy for the UN Refugee Agency. During the period she was undergoing the double mastectomy procedure, Ms Jolie visited the Democratic Republic of Congo with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and attended the G8 summit of foreign ministers in London to raise awareness over sexual violence in conflict. She also helped launch a charity to fund girls' education set up by the Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai, who survived being shot by the Taliban last October. Ms Jolie has three biological children and three adopted children. Risk factor Emma Parlons, a 38-year-old mother from London who had the operation three years ago, welcomed her decision to raise awareness of the issue. Ms Parlons said her risk of getting breast cancer was the same as the actress's. \"If somebody said your flight across the Atlantic was 86% likely to come down, you wouldn't get on that plane would you?\" she said in an explanation of her reasons for having the operation. Professor Gareth Evans, of the Manchester Breast Centre in Britain, said the two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer one and two) \"were the first two majorly breast cancer pre-disposing genes that were identified\" and are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \"The risk associated with the genes isn't simply an exact figure like 87%,\" he told the BBC. \"It does depend on other risk factors, and so the risk for someone with a BRCA1 mutation could vary anywhere between 50 and 95% for breast cancer.\" Currently, women facing a strong likelihood of developing breast cancer have only two real options - to have both of their breasts removed (a double mastectomy) or hope that it will never actually happen. In January, the drugs watchdog in England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommended women at a high genetic risk of breast cancer should be given the option of taking the drug Tamoxifen, or another one called raloxifene, for five years to cut their lifetime risk of the disease.", "summary": "为预防患乳腺癌，名震英美影坛的好莱坞影星安吉利娜·朱莉（Angelina Jolie)接受了双乳切除手术。"}

Australia will cut tariffs on Japanese electronics, cars and white goods. The deal, agreed after seven years of negotiations, is expected to be finalised later this year when Japan's prime minister visits Australia. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is currently visiting Japan, called the pact a historic one. \"This is the first time that Japan has negotiated a comprehensive economic partnership agreement or free trade agreement with a major economy, particularly a major economy with a strong agricultural sector,\" Mr Abbott said. Broader deal The pact between the two countries comes as officials are trying to push for an ambitious US-led 12-nation free trade plan, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Negotiations between representatives of the various nations, which include Australia and Japan, hit a roadblock earlier this year. Differences on the issues of tariffs on imported goods, particularly between the US and Japan, were among the issues that were unresolved. Agricultural tariffs have become a sticking point for Japan, which is keen to protect its rice, wheat, beef and pork producers from outside competition. Some analysts suggested that the Australian and Japan deal may help spur progress on the TPP talks. Aurelia George Mulgan, a professor of Japanese politics at University of New South Wales said the bilateral deal means that \"Australia gets preferential treatment over the US.\" She said that US would be under pressure to agree a deal that puts it \"on a level playing field with Australia\". \"Japan knows that America wants it on board, because TPP without Japan is not much worth all that much. Japan is playing hardball,\" she added. US President Barack Obama is scheduled to tour the region, including Japan, in the coming weeks and is expected to discuss the issue. 'Moderate recovery' Meanwhile, as expected, the Bank of Japan did not announce any new stimulus measures at the end of its two day meeting,, and said it was not expanding its bond buying programme. \"Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, albeit with some fluctuations due to the consumption tax hike,\" the Bank of Japan said in a statement. \"Private consumption and housing investment have remained resilient as a trend with improvement in the employment and income situation.\" Tokyo's Nikkei stock market fell 1.4%, its biggest drop in two weeks, as exporter shares were hit by a continued stronger yen.", "summary": "日本和澳大利亚已就自由贸易协定达成基本一致，这将降低双方主要产品的进口关税。"}

But on Wednesday Mr Trump insisted he had a \"good relationship\" with him. \"We're all in the same team including Dr Fauci,\" he said. \"We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us, so everybody's working on the same line and we're doing very well.\" The White House statement attacking Dr Fauci criticised him for what it said was conflicting advice on face coverings and remarks on Covid-19's severity. Responding to the criticism, Dr Fauci told The Atlantic that targeting him was \"completely wrong\". \"I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,\" he said. \"I think they realise now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it's only reflecting negatively on them,\" he added. Anthony Fauci isn't angry. He's just... disappointed. The top government expert on infectious diseases took the high road in his first public comments after White House officials, both on and off the record, questioned his professional judgement and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Fauci acknowledges that the advice and analysis he has provided has shifted over time, but he insists his recommendations have always been based on the latest science. Those views have sometimes led to clashes with the president, who has attempted to shift focus to rebuilding a US economy that has been devastated by the pandemic. Dr Fauci has said that the top priority must be controlling the spread of the virus and recent reopening steps have set those efforts back. Such blunt talk has helped make Dr Fauci a popular figure during the pandemic, and that alone may be behind some of the resentment that is simmering within the White House. The swipes at Dr Fauci, however, seem destined to be counter-productive. With a general election just a few months away the Trump campaign needs a consistent public message - and an administration attacking one of its own, then distancing itself from those attacks, may only promote a message of chaos and confusion. Dr Fauci was also criticised by Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's top trade adviser, in an opinion piece for USA Today in which he said the disease expert had been \"wrong about everything I have interacted with him on\". However, the White House distanced itself from Mr Navarro's remarks, with communications chief Alyssa Farah tweeting that the article \"didn't go through normal White House clearance processes\" and was \"the opinion of Peter alone\". Asked about Mr Navarro's piece as he departed the White House for Atlanta, Mr Trump said he should not have written it. \"Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that,\" he said. In his interview with The Atlantic, Dr Fauci said he was not thinking of resigning over the attacks on him. \"I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I'm really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I'm going to keep doing it,\" he said. He has also told Reuters that he believes the US will successfully develop a vaccine against the coronavirus by the end of the year. It follows early stage results from a vaccine developed by the firm Moderna, which Dr Fauci said were promising because the vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC, the US's top public health institute, has until now been responsible for handling data about the pandemic from its hospital network. Health experts have expressed concerns that data will be politicised, become less transparent and possibly affect the work of researchers and modellers. The US has reported more than 3.4 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 136,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.", "summary": "美国国家过敏和传染病研究所所长安东尼‧福西（Anthony Fauci）近日遭美国白宫发声批评，指他就新冠肺炎严重性及是否应该遮掩脸部提供了不一致的意见，他形容特朗普政府如此做法“荒诞”，有关说法是“胡言乱语”。"}

It was the single greatest loss of warships in history and the nine German sailors killed that day were the last to die during World War One. The final peace treaty was signed just a week later. After the fighting in WW1 ended in November 1918, the entire German fleet was ordered to gather together in the Firth of Forth, near Edinburgh, to be \"interned\" by Allied forces. Nine German battleships, five battlecruisers, seven light cruisers and 49 destroyers - the most modern ships of the German High Seas Fleet - were handed over to the victorious forces off the east of Scotland. Within a week, the 70 German ships were escorted to the sheltered waters of Scapa Flow, off Orkney, where they and four other vessels were held while the details of the peace talks were worked out. The final decision on their fate was to be taken at Versailles, but until then German sailors were kept on board their ships in the vast natural harbour. At Versailles, the victorious powers wrangled over what to do with the ships. Britain and the US wanted them destroyed. The French and Italians thought it better to share them out between the Allies. \"The ships were not actually surrendered and that's why there were no British troops on board them to prevent them being scuttled,\" Tom Muir from Orkney Museum told BBC Radio Scotland's When the Fleet Went Down. \"They were German government property and remained that throughout their time here.\" The German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was not kept informed of what was happening outside of his ships. He had to rely on briefings from British commanders and old copies of the Times newspaper, according to Tom Muir. The peace talks had been intended to conclude on 21 June but the deadline was extended. As far as von Reuter knew the talks had failed and he was fully expecting his ships to be boarded and seized by the Royal Navy. The German admiral felt duty-bound not to let that happen. Mr Muir says: \"Von Reuter had already sent letters around the commanders of the ships telling them that he was planning to have the fleet scuttled at his signal. Ironically it was the British drifters who were carting those letters around to the officers on the other ships.\" On the morning of 21 June 1919, the British fleet took advantage of good weather to steam out of the harbour on exercise. At 10:30, von Reuter's flagship, Emden, sent out the seemingly innocuous message - \"Paragraph Eleven; confirm\". It was a code ordering his men to scuttle their own ships. The day the German High Seas Fleet sank 52Warships sank to the seabed 9German sailors were killed 7months after the end of World War One 7wrecks still lie in Scapa Flow today The \"paragraph eleven\" signal, using semaphore and searchlights, took a while to reach all the ships because they were positioned right across the vast flow. \"They would have waited and like a wave it went through the ships from north to south,\" says Mr Muir. Beneath decks, German sailors began to open seacocks - valves that allow water in - and smash pipes. Mr Muir says: \"They had all been deliberately flooded from one side first so that they would turn over and sink because they believed it would make it more difficult for them to salvage them.\" At first it was not clear what was happening and it took a couple of hours before it became apparent that the Germans had deliberately sunk their ships. The German sailors took to small boats to escape their sinking ships as the few remaining British sailors onboard Royal Navy drifters, small vessels about the size of fishing trawlers which often escorted destroyers, tried to work out what to do. The only civilian witnesses were schoolchildren from Stromness who were on a trip to view the German fleet onboard a water tender. One of the schoolchildren, 12-year-old Leslie Thorpe, wrote that one German boat full of fleeing soldiers did not have a white flag and the British fired on it with a machine gun. \"The one thing that should not be forgotten is men died that day,\" says Mr Muir. \"We see all these images and it is just a huge piece of metal rolling over in the sea and sinking and you forget about the cost in human terms. \"The men in the drifters were ordered to open fire on the defenceless German sailors. They had no weapons, they were not allowed them and they didn't have any.\" It is believed nine Germans died as a result of the actions that day. By 17:00, most of the German High Seas Fleet had disappeared beneath the surface of Scapa Flow. The Hindenburg, the biggest German battlecruiser, was the last to sink. During the 1920s and '30s many of the 52 ships were lifted from the sea bed by commercial contractors and broken up. The seven wrecks that remain are now classed as scheduled monuments, nationally important archaeological sites given protection against unauthorised change. Earlier this week it emerged that four of the vessels, which are now owned by a retired diving contractor, are being sold on eBay. \"The scuttling of the German fleet removed them from being a bargaining chip in peace negotiations but it was seen as a hostile act by the British,\" says Mr Muir. \"In Germany it was seen as a way of restoring some honour. The navy had not let the ships fall into enemy hands.\" A senior German officer declared at the time that this act had wiped away the \"stain of surrender\" from the German fleet.

This included more than 100 in Nauru - the offshore centre condemned by the UN and rights groups for poor conditions. \"These are children that, among other things, have been denied freedom of movement, many of whom are spending important developmental years of their lives living behind wire in highly stressful environments,\" Prof Triggs said in a statement. The commission's first report on the subject, in 2004, found that mandatory detention of children of asylum-seekers was inconsistent with Australia's human rights obligations, and that long-term detention placed children \"at high risk of serious mental harm\". In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Ms Triggs highlighted a lack of co-operation from the immigration department. \"I think I'd have to say over the last few months, we've had minimal co-operation in relation to the kinds of details that I need to know, particularly mental health, self-harm and the processes for those that are transferred,\" she said. \"In particular, we'd like to understand more about the mental health of these children. The instances of self-harm, how they're being treated when they're manifesting conditions of extreme anxiety.\" Ms Triggs said the AHRC did not oppose detention for an appropriate period to establish the identity and health of a child. \"However, we are concerned that when the time moves beyond three to four months - to six, to 12, to 15 months - the likelihood is that we will be finding that there are breaches of international law.\" 'Chaotic mess' Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said officials would co-operate with the inquiry. \"But the reason there are children in detention is because over 50,000 turned up on illegal boats on Labor's watch so we're dealing with Labor's chaotic mess here,'' he told local radio. Those who arrive in Australia by boat to seek asylum are placed in mandatory immigration detention. The number of boat arrivals rose sharply in 2012 and the first half of 2013. In response, Australia re-opened offshore processing camps in Nauru, a tiny Pacific island, and in Papua New Guinea. The previous Labor government also introduced the deterrent \"PNG solution\" - an agreement whereby those found to be refugees would be settled in PNG, not Australia. Under the new Liberal-National coalition government, \"Operation Sovereign Borders\" - putting the military in charge of anti-people-smuggling efforts - has been introduced. Reports suggest Australia has been turning asylum boats back to Indonesia - and in January, Australia apologised for \"inadvertently\" violating Indonesia's territorial waters on multiple occasions. The government is strictly controlling the release of information around its asylum policy, prompting critics to accuse it of excessive secrecy. The government says it has drastically cut the number of boats arriving in Australia. Rights groups and UN agencies, meanwhile, continue to criticise conditions in Australia's offshore processing centres and to question whether its current asylum strategy violates its international obligations. The inquiry could be concluded before the end of the year, Ms Triggs said.", "summary": "澳大利亚人权委员会宣布将对该国目前实行的对未成年人难民进行羁押的政策展开调查。"}

Mr Assange, who denies the allegations, has sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition. If he goes to Sweden, he fears he could be extradited to the US to face charges of leaking government documents. Wikileaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have caused intense embarrassment for the US and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations. 'No reason' Two women in Sweden accuse Mr Assange, 43, of sexual assault. Thursday's decision at the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm ruled on an appeal against a similar decision by a lower court. Mr Assange's lawyers argued that the arrest warrant should be repealed because it could not be enforced while he was in the Ecuadorean embassy. Analysis by BBC World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams Before and during his self-imposed incarceration inside the Ecuadorean embassy, Julian Assange has been trying to clear his name through a whole series of legal hurdles. So far without success. Mr Assange's lawyers have attempted to challenge the legal basis for the allegations against him. But the allegations won't go away and today's ruling, while critical of the prosecution's failure to move the investigation forward, makes it plain that Mr Assange still has a case to answer. It offers no opinion on Mr Assange's claim that he cannot leave the safety of the Ecuadorean embassy without running the risk of being extradited to the United States and jailed for his role in the release of classified American military and diplomatic documents. But the fact remains that no such US extradition request exists. A lengthy grand jury investigation has not apparently resulted in any form of indictment. In 2013, when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden began leaking his own stash of damaging material, the importance of Julian Assange suddenly receded. The lawyers noted that Swedish prosecutors had not travelled to London to interrogate Mr Assange. In a statement, the court said there was \"no reason to set aside the detention solely because Julian Assange is in an embassy and the detention order cannot be enforced at present for that reason\". But it also criticised Swedish prosecutors for not making enough effort to explore \"alternative avenues\" to interrogate Mr Assange, saying the \"failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation\". Per Samuelson, one of Mr Assange's lawyers, told Reuters news agency that he believed the court's comments were a \"warning\" to prosecutors, and that the warrant would be revoked at a future hearing. He said the defence team would take the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement: \"Like the court of appeals says, there is every reason to continue considering how the case should be taken forward.\" Smear campaign Mr Assange has not been formally charged in Sweden, but prosecutors want to question him over allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the Scandinavian country in 2010. The Wikileaks founder denies the allegations and has said they are part of a smear campaign against him. The Ecuadorean government granted asylum to Mr Assange in 2012 after the UK Supreme Court refused to reopen his appeal against extradition. Ecuador says there are fears his human rights might be violated if he is extradited. Chelsea Manning, an American soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in the US for passing documents to Wikileaks. But no US extradition request for Mr Assange exists and a spokeswoman at the US embassy in London said Mr Assange was not currently a person of interest.

Freud, a grandson of the psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud, was born in Berlin in 1922 and fled to Britain with his Jewish family in 1933, when he was 10. Freud - particularly known for his paintings of nudes - became a British citizen in 1939. His works have been increasingly sought after at recent auctions and his portrayal of an overweight nude woman sleeping on a couch sold in 2008 for $33.6m (£20.6m) - a world record for a work by a living artist. 'Lived to paint' Mr Acquavella described Freud \"as one of the great painters of the 20th Century\". \"In company he was exciting, humble, warm and witty. He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world.\" Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate gallery, said: \"The vitality of [Freud's] nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th Century art. \"His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.\" Former Observer art critic William Feaver, who knew Freud for more than 40 years, said Freud was someone who had \"restored portraiture to its proper place\", by focusing on all types of people, not just successful businessmen and their wives. \"He said everything he did was autobiographical and a self portrait. He was a witty, impulsive artist but generous with it.\" Mr Feaver said Freud had left several unfinished paintings. He said: \"He always liked to keep a couple of paintings on the go in case he dropped off the twig and I know he's done that.\" Former muse Sue Tilley, who sat for the nude Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, said she had \"fantastic experiences\" while posing for the portrait. \"I found out last night on Twitter, bizarrely, and I did start crying,\" she told BBC Breakfast. \"I haven't seen him for a long time and he's not really a close friend now but it's a part of my life that's kind of gone.\" Order of Merit Freud, the son of an architect and older brother of the late broadcaster Clement Freud, went to the Central School of Art, in London and then to the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing and London's Goldsmiths College. At first he confined himself to drawing, but when he was 17 had a self-portrait accepted for reproduction in the magazine, Horizon. Freud was recognised early on and after a spell in the Merchant Navy in 1942, had his first one-man show in 1944, when he was 21. After the war he went to France and Greece, and having taken up painting by then, returned to the UK in 1948 to teach for 10 years at the Slade School of Art. Freud was married twice, first to sculptor Jacob Epstein's daughter, Kitty, the subject of his celebrated Girl With a White Dog. His second wife was the daughter of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. Freud's other key works include Naked Girl Asleep and Reflection (self portrait). The Queen and supermodel Kate Moss are among those to have sat for the artist. Freud was a member of the Order of Merit, one of Britain's most prestigious chivalry honours presented to individuals by the Queen for great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science. The honour is restricted to 24 members at any one time, plus additional foreign recipients and past recipients include Florence Nightingale, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Elgar and Mother Teresa.", "summary": "88岁辞世的卢西安·弗洛伊德（Lucian Freud）是英国最受尊重的画家之一。"}

They are the first top-level leaders to be held accountable for its crimes. Up to two million people are thought to have died under the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime - of starvation and overwork or executed as enemies of the state. Judge Nil Nonn said the men were guilty of \"extermination encompassing murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, enforced disappearances and attacks against human dignity''. Lawyers for the pair said they would appeal against the ruling. \"It is unjust for my client. He did not know or commit many of these crimes,\" Son Arun, a lawyer for Nuon Chea, told journalists. They will remain in detention while this takes place. 'Anger remains' The regime sought to create an agrarian society: cities were emptied and their residents forced to work on rural co-operatives. Many were worked to death while others starved as the economy imploded. During four violent years, the Khmer Rouge also killed all those it perceived as enemies - intellectuals, minorities, former officials - and their families. Nuon Chea was seen as an ideological driving force within the regime. Khieu Samphan was its public face. Prosecutors argued that they formulated policy and were complicit in its brutal execution. Over three years the court has heard from some of those who lost entire families to the regime. \"My anger remains in my heart,'' Suon Mom, 75, whose husband and four children starved to death, told the Associated Press news agency. \"I still remember the day I left Phnom Penh, walking along the road without having any food or water to drink.\" Jonathan Head, BBC News, Phnom Penh After three years of hearings, and a summary of charges that ran for 90 minutes, the presiding judge delivered sentencing against the two elderly defendants surprisingly briskly. Both men were guilty of crimes against humanity, both were sentenced to life in prison. Khieu Samphan, the urbane, international face of the Khmer Rouge, was found not to have had authority over those carrying out the worst atrocities documented by the tribunal. Nuon Chea was found guilty on all charges. Both in the end received the same sentence, somewhat academic given that both men are in their eighties, and in poor health. They had insisted on their innocence, dismissing the accusations against them as propaganda and lies. Their defence, though, was dismissed by the tribunal as lacking credibility. Nuon Chea, unable to stand for the sentence, showed little emotion, but Khieu Samphan appeared visibly angry. They had told their families not to come and hear the verdicts. It was in many ways an anticlimactic end to the only official accounting for the horrors of the Khmer Rouge years. The true value of this unique \"hybrid\" tribunal, blending international and Cambodian judicial authority, is still difficult to assess. Justice delayed Outside the court, Khmer Rouge survivor Nou Saota said: \"I feel so happy and relieved. A huge burden has been lifted off me.\" Youk Chang, another survivor, told the BBC the verdict was \"a little too late for many\" but said it was vital the trial took place. \"It's important for the young population to learn this lesson so that we can prevent such atrocity from occurring anywhere, not just in Cambodia,\" he said. Rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, called the ruling \"an important step towards justice\", as it noted \"troubling\" obstacles the court had faced. Some have criticised the slow pace and cost of the court. In 2012, a Swiss judge resigned, saying his investigations into other Khmer Rouge suspects were being blocked. 'Socialist revolution' Both Khmer Rouge leaders denied the charges against them. In closing statements last year, they expressed remorse but said they had neither ordered deaths nor been aware of them. In a statement shortly after the ruling, the court said both men had participated in \"a joint criminal enterprise to achieve the common purpose of implementing a rapid socialist revolution... by whatever means necessary\". The pair also face a separate genocide trial. The case against them was split to accelerate proceedings, because of their age. Who were the Khmer Rouge? Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime Two other former Khmer Rouge ministers were to be tried with them. Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister, died in March 2013. His wife Ieng Thirith, who served as the regime's social affairs minister, has been ruled unfit to stand trial. Before this, former prison chief Duch was the only senior Khmer Rouge figure held to account, but he was not part of the regime's central leadership. He was jailed in 2010 for running the Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of people defined as enemies of the regime were tortured and killed.", "summary": "在联合国支持下设立的柬埔寨特别战争罪法庭判处两名前红色高棉领导人终身监禁。"}

Previously unregistered works by Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse were found. Prosecutors said the issue of ownership was still being clarified. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Reinhard Nemetz, head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works had been seized in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in Munich in March of last year. It was not yet clear if any offence had been committed, he added, stressing that the legal position was extremely complex. Investigators, he said, had turned up \"concrete evidence\" that at least some of the works had been seized by the Nazis from their owners or had been deemed \"degenerate\". Art expert Meike Hoffmann said some of the works were dirty but they had not been damaged. 'Extraordinarily good' \"When you stand before the works and see again these long-lost, missing works, that were believed destroyed, seeing them in quite good condition, it's an extraordinarily good feeling,\" Ms Hoffmann said. \"The pictures are of exceptional quality, and have very special value for art experts. Many works were unknown until now.\" Other artists whose works were found include Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Canaletto and Gustave Courbet. The paintings were found in March of last year after Mr Gurlitt was investigated for tax evasion. The framed pictures were stacked on a shelf, like in a museum storeroom while the unframed works were piled up in drawers, said customs official Siegfried Kloeble. According to a report by Germany's Focus magazine, Mr Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich, would occasionally sell a picture when he needed money. \"We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest,\" said Mr Nemetz, adding that the current whereabouts of Mr Gurlitt were unknown. Asked at the news conference why the German authorities had taken so long to reveal the paintings, the prosecutor said it would have been \"counter-productive to go public\" with the case earlier. Mr Kloeble refused to say where the artworks were being stored. Mr Gurlitt's father Hildebrand collected early 20th Century art regarded by the Nazis as un-German or \"degenerate\", and removed from show in state museums. He was recruited by the Nazis to sell the \"degenerate art\" abroad but also bought privately. After the war he told investigators that his collection had been destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. He also said he had been persecuted himself for having a Jewish grandmother. Resuming his work as a dealer, he died in a car crash in 1956. A Jewish group has questioned the length of time it took Germany to unveil the artworks and called for them to be returned to their original owners. \"It cannot be, as in this case, that what amounts morally to the concealment of stolen goods continues,\" said Ruediger Mahlo, speaking for the Conference on Jewish material claims against Germany. 'Justice denied' Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU, told the BBC that time was running out, and the details of the artworks should be published. \"Victims of the Holocaust are aging, even the families of those who did not survive are of an age,\" he said. \"It's important that this be publicised. But the longer one goes... the more difficult it is for people to prepare potential claims... Justice delayed is justice denied.\" However, prosecutors say it would not be proper procedure to put things on the internet and people who want to make a claim should contact them directly. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Munich says that descendants of owners of art taken by German forces in occupied Europe may be able to make claims. However, there are suggestions that art taken in Germany itself may not be reclaimable because of a 30-year statute of limitations. Mr Mahlo said that private collections of such art under the Third Reich had been almost all Jewish. However, auctioneers have argued that at least some of the works were purchased cheaply in 1938 by Mr Gurlitt's father from a collection of state-owned art. In 1990, Cornelius Gurlitt auctioned works for 38,250 Swiss francs (31,000 euros) in Galerie Kornfeld, an auction house and gallery in the Swiss city of Bern. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galerie Kornfeld said: \"Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the works after the death of his mother Helene. Basically this is a case of undeclared inheritance.\"", "summary": "德国官员说，在慕尼黑1400多件纳粹洗劫的艺术藏品中发现了一些大师的未被人知的作品。"}

The programme alleged that blueprints to the new intelligence headquarters in Canberra - due to be finished last year but delayed - were stolen in a cyber attack on a contractor that was traced to a server in China. The plans detailed communications cabling and server locations, floor plans and security systems, the programme alleged. It quoted Professor Des Ball, an expert on cyber security from the Australian National University, as saying access to such details would enable an outside party to identify rooms used for sensitive activities and work out how to monitor them. The programme also alleged that the Prime Minster's Office, the Defence Ministry and the Department of Foreign Affairs had been breached in hacking operations. Four Corners did not identify the source of its information. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei rejected the claims, saying \"groundless\" accusations would not solve the problem of cyber hacking. \"Since it is technically untraceable, it is very difficult to find the source and identify the hacker,'' he said. \"Therefore we have no idea what is the evidence for their report in which they make the claim with such certainty.'' Earlier this year, hackers from China - which is now Australia's biggest trading partner - were thought to be behind an attack on the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Financial Review reported. The issue of cyber espionage looks set to be high on the agenda when the US and Chinese presidents hold their first summit in California next month. Earlier this month, the Pentagon for the first time directly accused the Chinese government and military of targeting US government computers as part of a cyber espionage campaign aimed at collecting intelligence on US diplomatic, economic and defence sectors.

The aircraft that the spacecraft was launched from, known as White Knight 2, landed safely, Virgin Galactic said. It was the second accident this week involving a commercial space company in the US. On Tuesday, an unmanned supply rocket called Antares exploded shortly after its launch from Virginia. It was carrying cargo to the International Space Station. Ken Brown, a photographer who witnessed the SpaceShipTwo crash, said the craft had exploded after it was released from the plane that carried it to a high altitude. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board will begin their work on Saturday morning to investigate the cause of the accident, which will probably take several days. \"We are going to be supporting the investigation as we figure out what happened today,\" said George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic. \"The future rests in many ways on hard days like this but we believe we owe it to the folks who were flying these vehicles as well as the folks working so hard on this to understand this and move forward.\" Analysis: David Shukman, BBC science editor Even as details emerge of what went wrong, this is clearly a massive setback to a company hoping to pioneer a new industry of space tourism. Confidence is everything and this will not encourage the long list of celebrity and millionaire customers waiting for their first flight. An innovative design for a spacecraft combined with a new type of rocket motor make the development challenge exceptionally hard.

Space is never easy, and making it routine is even harder. Will crash set back space tourism? Virgin Galactic has been a frontrunner in the nascent space tourism industry, and Sir Richard said earlier in October he expected to see the craft make it to sub-orbital space within a few months.

The IMF loan will also unlock further funds worth $15bn from other donors, including the World Bank, EU, Canada and Japan. Months of turmoil have taken their toll. Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that the economy would shrink by at least 3% this year - and by as much as 10% without international assistance. But the price of that help will come in the form of higher energy bills and wage freezes. So why is the Ukrainian economy in such bad shape? And what is being done to fix it? What is the state of Ukraine's economy? In a nutshell: heavily indebted. Ukraine's new government has said it needs $35bn (£21bn) to pay its bills over the next two years, which the new loans should mostly cover. It owes the Russian gas company Gazprom $1.9bn. The Ukrainian economy shrank 0.3% in 2013, the IMF estimates. And the months of street protests, when the barricades were up on the streets of the capital, Kiev, will also have had an effect. The new government has also accused ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and his government of stripping billions from state coffers. The currency, the hryvnia, lost nearly a fifth of its value in February alone. It now stands at 11 to the US dollar, down from eight in January. The economy is struggling to recover from a recession and has been shaken by capital flight, as worried investors move their money abroad. Efforts to prop up the hryvnia have also depleted foreign currency reserves. Ukraine's stormy economy has history The Ukraine currency blame game Ukrainian currency hits 10-year low What difference will international aid make? A few months ago, a $15bn rescue package from Russia looked likely. But that was before street protests led to the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych, Moscow's man. Now the IMF and other international donors are stumping up a total of $32.1bn, reducing the risk that Ukraine will default on its debts. But the loan is dependent on strict economic reforms, including raising taxes and energy prices. The government has already raised gas prices by 50% in an effort to secure the bailout. It has also agreed to freeze the minimum wage. And Ukraine has a chequered history with the IMF: it failed to keep to the terms of previous assistance packages in 2008 and 2010. What economic help for Ukraine? What kind of economy does Ukraine have? Ukraine has a history of corruption and mismanagement that goes back to Soviet times. Consider this: Ukraine's economy is smaller than it was in 1992, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time, Ukraine and Poland had similar-sized economies, but Poland's economy is now twice as big as Ukraine's. The IMF estimates that the Ukrainian economy shrank 0.3% last year after barely growing in 2012. Ukraine has a lot of coal mining, especially around the eastern city of Donetsk, as well as ageing heavy industry including shipbuilding, steel and arms. However, because many industries are so energy-inefficient, they are highly dependent on imports of Russian gas, which have been heavily subsidised. Farming is also important: Ukraine has more arable land than any other European country and is a major producer of grain and sunflower oil. Wheat prices have risen 20% on world markets, partly because of the fear of instability in Ukraine. And then there is the shadow economy: everything from cash-in-hand labour to corruption to illegal activities. A 2012 study by two Ukrainian academics reckons the shadow economy is equivalent to 44% of Ukraine's economic output. In 2013, Ukraine was ranked 144 out of 177 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Business and politics are deeply intertwined: Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov was until recently an MP and a supporter of ex-President Yanukovych. His companies have received an important share of state tenders. Ukraine's stormy economy has history UOligarchs are Ukraine's weakest link What is the new Ukrainian government doing? Before the latest household gas price rise, consumers paid only a quarter of the cost of imported gas. The price increase was one of the conditions demanded by the IMF, but it was an unpopular measure that President Yanukovych refused to take. As well as the minimum wage freeze, taxes will go up and 10% of civil servants will be made redundant. There are also plans to cut corruption and red tape. And the IMF wants the hryvnia to float more freely against the dollar. But the government faces a dilemma: if its reforms inflict too much pain, protesters could - having removed one government - take to the streets again. Just ask the Egyptians. What effect will the dispute with Russia have? The dispute with Russia has already cost Ukraine the Crimea region. It also means higher energy prices. In return for the lease of the naval base at Sevastopol for the Black Sea fleet, Russia agreed to subsidise energy exports to Ukraine. Now Crimea has been annexed by Russia and the Russian state-controlled producer Gazprom is ending Ukraine's one-third discount. However, the loss of Crimea at least takes it off the books of the government in Kiev, which was paying for about two-thirds of its budget. The government in Kiev says if Russia goes ahead with trade restrictions, those could lower economic growth by up to 1%. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to the areas near Ukraine's eastern border, raising tensions. Even if Russia decides not to invade, the prospect of further instability will not do the Ukrainian economy any good.", "summary": "国际货币基金组织（IMF）批准了对乌克兰一项总额170亿美元的资金救助，以帮助乌克兰经济恢复稳定。"}

The research will take place at the Francis Crick Institute in London and aims to provide a deeper understanding of the earliest moments of human life. It will be illegal for the scientists to implant the modified embryos into a woman. But the field is attracting controversy over concerns it is opening the door to designer - or GM - babies. DNA is the blueprint of life - the instructions for building the human body. Gene editing allows the precise manipulation of DNA. In a world-first last year, scientists in China announced they had carried out gene editing in human embryos to correct a gene that causes a blood disorder. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, a scientific advisor to the UK's fertility regulator, told the BBC: \"China has guidelines, but it is often unclear exactly what they are until you've done it and stepped over an unclear boundary. \"This is the first time it has gone through a properly regulatory system and been approved.\" Groundbreaking The experiments will take place in the first seven days after fertilisation. During this time we go from a fertilised egg to a structure called a blastocyst, containing 200-300 cells. The work will be led by Dr Kathy Niakan, who has spent a decade researching human development. Earlier this year, she explained why she had applied to edit human embryos: \"We would really like to understand the genes needed for a human embryo to develop successfully into a healthy baby. \"The reason why it is so important is because miscarriages and infertility are extremely common, but they're not very well understood.\" Out of every 100 fertilised eggs, fewer than 50 reach the early blastocyst stage, 25 implant into the womb and only 13 develop beyond three months. And at the blastocyst stage, some cells have been organised to perform specific roles - some go on to form the placenta, others the yolk sac and others ultimately us. How and why this takes place is unknown - but some parts of our DNA are highly active at this stage. It is likely these genes are guiding our early development, but it is unclear exactly what they are doing or what goes wrong in miscarriage. The researchers will alter these genes in donated embryos, which will be destroyed after seven days. The regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), has given its approval and the experiments could start in the next few months. Arguments Paul Nurse, the director of the Crick, said: \"I am delighted that the HFEA has approved Dr Niakan's application. \"Dr Niakan's proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development.\" Dr David King, the director of Human Genetics Alert, said: \"This research will allow the scientists to refine the techniques for creating GM babies, and many of the government's scientific advisers have already decided that they are in favour of allowing that. \"So this is the first step in a well mapped-out process leading to GM babies, and a future of consumer eugenics.\" Dr Sarah Chan, from the University of Edinburgh, said: \"The use of genome editing technologies in embryo research touches on some sensitive issues, therefore it is appropriate that this research and its ethical implications have been carefully considered by the HFEA before being given approval to proceed. \"We should feel confident that our regulatory system in this area is functioning well to keep science aligned with social interests.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "英国科学家得到有关监管部门的批准，将对人类胚胎进行基因改造工程研究。"}

Speaking in the ruins of an ancient city, he called for a full account of the abuses. Spain rejected his call and called for a \"constructive perspective\" instead. The territory which now makes up Mexico was under Spanish rule for some 300 years before gaining independence in the early 19th Century. At the time of the conquest, Spain was a fiercely Roman Catholic country and saw as its mission the spread of Christianity to regions such as the Americas. Why does Mexico want an apology now? The man who became Mexico's first leftist president in seven decades has been pursuing a radical agenda since being sworn in in December, promising to tackle corruption, reduce inequality and lift millions of Mexicans out of poverty. On Monday, he tweeted a video address from an archaeological site in Comacalco, Tabasco, where he is shown speaking alongside the First Lady, Beatriz Gutierrez. \"I have sent a letter to the Spanish king [Felipe VI] and another letter to the Pope so that the abuses can be acknowledged and an apology can be made to the indigenous peoples for the violations of what we now call human rights,\" Mr López Obrador says. \"There were massacres... The so-called conquest was done with the sword and the cross. They raised churches on top of temples.\" \"The time has come to reconcile but first they should ask forgiveness,\" the president says. Mexico has the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, after Brazil. Just over a fifth of Mexicans consider themselves to be indigenous but studies suggest many more have some pre-Hispanic ancestry. When Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Mexico in January he presented President López Obrador with his grandfather José Obrador's Spanish birth certificate, from 1893, AFP news agency reports. What was the response? The Mexican leader's relations with Spain's centre-left ruling party have been friendly but the government in Madrid promptly rejected his request for an apology. \"The arrival, 500 years ago, of Spaniards to present Mexican territory cannot be judged in the light of contemporary considerations,\" the government said in a statement. \"Our two brother nations have always known how to read our shared past without anger and with a constructive perspective.\" There was no immediate comment from the Vatican but three years ago, on a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis asked indigenous people for forgiveness over the way they had been excluded from society. \"Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior. Others, intoxicated by power, money and market trends, have stolen your lands or contaminated them. How sad this is,\" he said. \"How worthwhile it would be for each of us to examine our conscience and learn to say, 'Forgive me!'\" What was the Spanish conquest of the Americas? It started with an expedition led by Christopher Columbus in 1492. The conquest of Mexico began in 1519 when a small army led by Hernán Cortés landed in the modern-day state of Veracruz. Within two years, the Spanish had overcome the powerful Aztec Empire. Their victory was attributed to the skilled leadership of Cortés, who made local allies for his campaign against the Aztecs, as well as their superior weapons. Large numbers of indigenous people died in battle or in massacres such as that at Cholula, while diseases the Spanish inadvertently brought with them accounted for massive loss of life.", "summary": "墨西哥总统最近致函西班牙国王费力佩六世和罗马天主教皇方济各，要求他们为历史上在征服和殖民统治美洲期间犯下的侵犯践踏人权行为道歉。"}

Another three were found guilty of disobedience and fined, but not jailed. All 12 defendants denied the charges. Large crowds of pro-independence protesters clashed with police at Barcelona's international airport. Footage showed people attempting to break through a police line blocking one area of the building, while in another, officers hit protesters with batons and attempted to disperse the crowds with gas. A total of 108 flights were cancelled on Monday, the Spanish airport authority Aena said. Thousands of Catalan independence supporters also marched in the city centre, blocking some streets and access to metro stations. After the ruling, a new arrest warrant was issued for former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is living abroad. Mr Puigdemont told a press conference that Catalonians were victims of a \"strategy of repression and revenge\". What happened at the trial? Some of the 12 leaders sentenced on Monday had held prominent positions in Catalonia's government and parliament, while others were influential activists and cultural advocates. During four months of hearings, they told the court in Madrid that they were victims of an injustice in a trial built on \"false\" charges. The longest sentence of 13 years was handed to Oriol Junqueras, the former vice-president of Catalonia and the highest-ranking pro-independence leader on trial, for sedition and misuse of public funds. The prosecution had sought up to 25 years in prison for Junqueras. The new European and international arrest warrant against Mr Puigdemont was issued on grounds of sedition and misuse of public funds. He fled to Belgium in October 2017 to avoid prosecution in Spain following the failed independence bid. What has the reaction been? Junqueras accused Spain of jailing people for their political ideals and pledged that the separatists would return even stronger. But Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez insisted the leaders had been jailed for criminal conduct. Mr Puigdemont said the sentences handed to separatist leaders of \"100 years in total\" were \"an atrocity\". \"Now more than ever... it is time to react like never before,\" he wrote on Twitter, adding: \"For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia.\" Those on the street communicated feelings of anger and powerlessness. \"Today is going to be historic, you can feel it in the atmosphere. Serious things are happening, we can't stay home,\" Oscar Quiles, a 47-year-old real estate entrepreneur told AFP news agency. \"The indignation is just too much and affects too many people,\" another protester said. \"What they don't realise is that we are very angry and we will not stop.\" Anger spills on to the streets of Barcelona By Damian Grammaticas, Europe correspondent The sentences handed down have shocked many across Catalonia. Shortly after they were announced small knots of students - banners and flags held aloft - began marching in Barcelona, heading for the squares where they gathered during the independence bid two years ago. Anger swirled in the air along with sound of whistles and loudhailers. \"This is not justice, this is revenge\" they shouted. Madrid deployed police reinforcements in the region and sections of the city's streets were cordoned off to traffic. The prison terms given to the Catalan independence leaders were not the 25 years prosecutors had sought in some cases, but they are nevertheless seen as an outrage by many Catalans. The Catalan National Assembly called for \"mobilisations around the globe\" - including in the UK, France and Germany - in a tweet using the hashtag #StandUpForCatalonia. Others used the hashtag to post footage of students marching in protest against the sentences moments after they were announced on Monday. Meanwhile, both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation condemned the prison sentences and called for \"dialogue and negotiation\" to resolve the situation. The federation added that it had suspended all football matches in the region to show solidarity with the leaders and their families. Over the weekend, hundreds of protesters rallied in the city. In 2017, police and protesters clashed in the streets when Catalonia's pro-independence leaders went ahead with the referendum, which had been ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court. Who else has been sentenced? Other separatist leaders to receive prison sentences for sedition were: The nine leaders, who had already spent months in pre-trial detention, were acquitted of a more serious charge of rebellion. The remaining three defendants were earlier released on bail. During their closing arguments in June, defence lawyers told the court their clients denied the charges of rebellion and sedition, but admitted to the lesser charge of disobedience which could have seen them be banned from public office but avoid prison. How did they end up in court? Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said that separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum. Prosecutors argued the leaders had carried out a \"perfectly planned strategy... to break the constitutional order and obtain the independence of Catalonia\" illegally. Forcadell, the former parliament speaker who read out the independence result on 27 October 2017, was also accused of allowing parliamentary debates on independence despite warnings from Spain's Constitutional Court. Some of the leaders, speaking to the BBC ahead of the trial, said the proceedings were political in nature. Any violence, they said, was on the part of police and committed against voters in a crackdown which made headlines around the world. Three weeks after the banned 2017 vote, the Catalan parliament declared an independent republic. Madrid stepped in to impose its rule on the region, and several Catalan leaders fled or were arrested. What is behind the Catalonia controversy? Catalan nationalists have long complained that their region, which has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years, sends too much money to poorer parts of Spain, as taxes are controlled by Madrid. The wealthy region is home to about 7.5 million people, with their own language, parliament, flag and anthem. In September, a march in Barcelona in support of Catalonia's independence from Spain drew crowds of about 600,000 people - one of the lowest turnouts in the eight-year history of the annual rally.", "summary": "西班牙最高法院判决加泰罗尼亚（又译加泰隆尼亚）独立派领导人9至13年监禁后，巴塞罗那爆发了抗议活动。"}

A group calling itself \"Fancy Bears\" claimed responsibility for the hack of a Wada database. After the leak, Ms Biles said she had long been taking medicine for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The hacker group had accused her of taking an \"illicit psycho-stimulant\", but she said she had \"always followed the rules\". The Rio Olympics quadruple gold medallist had obtained the necessary permission to take prescription medicine on the Wada banned drugs list, USA Gymnastics said in a statement. Wada said in a statement that the cyber attacks were an attempt to undermine the global anti-doping system. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was \"out of the question\" that the Kremlin or secret services were involved in the hacking, Russian news agencies reported. The hackers accessed records detailing \"Therapeutic Use Exemptions\" (TUEs), which allow the use of banned substances due to athletes' verified medical needs. \"By virtue of the TUE, Biles has not broken any drug-testing regulations, including at the Olympic Games in Rio,\" USA Gymnastics said. Fancy Bears said TUEs amount to \"licences for doping\". The leaked documents allege that Serena Williams was granted permission to use drugs commonly used to treat muscle injuries, such as anti-inflammatories, while Biles is said to use Ritalin - a treatment for her ADHD. Former - Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority head Richard Ings said: \"Nothing I see here gives me cause for alarm,\" adding it looked \"totally normal\". \"The issue here is privacy breach.\" 'Compromising trust' Russia's track and field team were banned from the Rio Olympics over an alleged state-backed doping programme. All of its athletes are barred from the ongoing Paralympics. \"Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia,\" Wada director-general Olivier Niggli said. 'An act of revenge?' - Analysis by BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is the latest twist in what was already the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport, and further evidence of the bitter divisions it has sparked. The hack appears to be an act of revenge - retaliation for Wada's damning report into Russian state-sponsored cheating. Although the Russian government has denied any involvement, it has always maintained that the country has been made a scapegoat for a much wider problem, and this will only add fuel to that fire. Although the athletes concerned have broken no rules, the revelations - along with the threat of more leaks of other competitors' medical records - will inevitably exacerbate the controversy surrounding TUEs at a time when sport's leaders are desperately trying to restore trust. Many athletes will now be nervously wondering if their private medical details records are the next to be made public. And with the future of Wada currently in the balance, the fact its security was so badly compromised will raise more questions over the entire anti-doping system, especially after the account of Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova was hacked last month, leading to fears for her safety. US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart called the hack \"cowardly and despicable\". \"In each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication,\" he said. The US Olympic Committee has had \"zero adverse findings from the Rio Olympic Games that weren't 100% within the medical guidelines set forth by anti-doping authorities,\" spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. Earlier this month, Mr Niggli said Wada was experiencing almost daily cyber attacks originating from Russia. Fancy Bears, which is also known as Tsar Team (APT28), has pledged to release confidential records from other national Olympic teams. How Wada was hacked - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter It's an old adage in cybersecurity that the weakest point of any supposedly secure system is the people that use it. Wada says it believes this hack was made possible thanks to a successful spearphishing attack. Phishing is a term given to the technique of tricking a user into giving up crucial information - often by clicking a link that takes them to a malicious website disguised as a familiar one, such as the log-in page for a bank or social network. Spearphishing takes this one significant step further. While a phishing attack is often aimed at many people in the hope some will fall for it, spearphishing is highly targeted. Hackers perhaps identified a small number of people, or even just one person, and wrote a phishing attack specifically designed to trick them. Other than pushing a message of vigilance among staff, spearphishing is incredibly difficult to defend against. Attackers often scour the internet, looking for added information on the target that might make an email more believable. Sometimes even knowing a person's favourite football team is enough to tip the balance in making a spearphishing email seem genuine.", "summary": "世界反禁药组织机构（WADA）谴责俄罗斯黑客泄露美国奥运运动员的机密医疗档案。"}

Thousands of people, many fleeing war and persecution, are trying to reach northern Europe to claim asylum. EU states are engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity to find a solution. The crisis has highlighted the limitations of the EU's system for coping with refugees, the BBC's Chris Morris says. Under an EU rule known as the Dublin Regulation, refugees should seek asylum in the first EU country they enter. But with countries such as Italy and Greece saying they cannot cope with the numbers, many have headed north. Hungary had earlier appeared to abandon efforts to register migrants, allowing huge numbers to board trains at Keleti station in east Budapest and travel to Vienna and southern Germany on Monday. Analysis by Chris Morris, BBC's Europe correspondent The European Union is supposed to have a common asylum system but at the moment it's not worth much more than the paper it's written on. Many of the migrants currently trying to reach Germany via Hungary probably arrived first in Greece. But they left the EU to travel through Macedonia and Serbia before crossing back into Hungary. Now the Hungarian government says it is trying to apply EU law, but it clearly doesn't want them to stay. In other words the system is close to breaking point and needs reform. Most of the ideas being discussed at the moment - a fairer distribution of asylum seekers around Europe, much more help for Greece and Italy to register arriving migrants, and more effective action to send failed asylum seekers home - have already been approved by EU leaders. But much of this emerging policy has yet to be put into practice, and new rules are rapidly being overtaken by events. But police evacuated the station on Tuesday, leaving about 1,000 migrants outside. The station later allowed non-migrant passengers to enter via a side entrance, but lines of police kept migrants out. An angry crowd chanted \"Germany, Germany\" and waved train tickets.

Correspondents say Hungary's action appeared prompted in part by pressure from other EU states struggling to cope with the influx of migrants. About 3,650 arrived in Vienna by train on Monday, many intending to carry on to Germany. German police said 3,500 asylum-seekers arrived in Bavaria on Tuesday while Belgium and Sweden also reported a surge in migrant numbers. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told reporters on Tuesday that Hungary would now register all migrants and send those it considered to be economic migrants back to the state from which they entered the country. Prime Minister Viktor Orban is due to meet senior EU officials on Thursday in Brussels. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. Germany expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year - four times last year's total. German Labour Minister Andrea Nahles said the influx meant between 240,000 and 460,000 more people could be entitled to social benefits next year, costing the state billions of euros.

Meanwhile, the EU's Frontex border agency said a trade in fake Syrian passports had emerged, mainly in Turkey. \"They know Syrians get the right to asylum in the European Union,\" Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri told French radio.

To the cheering of thousands of students of one of Thailand's top universities, she read out a now-famous 10-point manifesto, calling for reform of the monarchy. It was a shocking move. Thais are taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy, but also to fear the consequences of speaking about it. 'Life would never be the same' Thailand is one of the few countries with a lese majeste law. Anyone criticising the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent could be jailed for up to 15 years. But in the past few months, pro-democracy protests have swept the country, and students like Panusaya are at the heart of it. \"I knew my life would never be the same,\" she later told BBC News Thai. Panusaya had been shown the manifesto just hours before she read it out at a rare large protest in the capital, Bangkok. It called for a monarchy accountable to the elected institutions, a proposal to trim the royal budget and for the monarchy to refrain from interfering in politics - shocking statements to most Thais. \"They passed it to me, asked me if I wished to use it. At that point, everyone felt the content was extraordinarily strong and I too thought it was very strong. I decided to be that person who says it. \"I held hands with my fellow students, asking aloud whether we were doing the right thing here,\" Panusaya says. \"The answer was yes - it's the right thing to do. I then sat down again, smoked a cigarette before I went on stage and let everything in my head out.\" From the stage, she told the crowd: \"All humans have red blood. We are no different. \"No-one in this world is born with blue blood. Some people may be born more fortunate than others, but no one is born more noble than anyone else.\" Panusaya's speech caused an uproar - a combination of applause from liberal academics, and condemnation from royalist media outlets, mixed with disbelief from many Thais. 'Hating your own country is a disease' In the days after the rally, the Facebook pages of top royalist activists were abuzz with attacks on Panusaya, some accusing her of being manipulated by republican politicians, which she denied. Apirat Kongsompong, the powerful army commander in a country still dominated by the military, said the protesters were afflicted by \"chung chart\" - a Thai term meaning \"hatred of the nation\" - and added that this was even more dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic. \"Hating your own country is a disease that is not curable,\" he said. Yet Panusaya says even as a young child she remembers questioning the position of the royal family in Thai life. On one sweltering day, an official showed up at the door and asked her family to leave their house and sit down on the pavement in anticipation of a royal motorcade. \"Why do we have to come out in the sun for half an hour to see a passing motorcade? I didn't have a clue what's going on. I didn't go out to join the waiting crowds.\" The youngest of three sisters, she showed an interest in politics early on. In high school, discussing politics with her close friends was one of her favourite pastimes. When a coup took place in 2014, her father - the only one in the family who followed politics back then - encouraged her to find out more. But Panusaya was shy growing up and was bullied at school. It was five months spent in a student exchange programme to America that changed her completely. \"I returned home a different person who was not afraid to speak out and act.\" She became increasingly politically active after entering the prestigious Thammasat University. Two years ago, she joined the \"Dome Revolution\", a student union political party. In February, she helped organise the first pro-democracy flash mob protests after the dissolution of the Future Forward Party, a reformist party popular with younger voters that was disbanded after a controversial court ruling that it had accepted illegal loans from its own leader. The party did well in the 2019 elections and its dissolution was viewed by its supporters as an attempt to remove its growing political influence. But these were not the only events to inspire young people to join Thailand's growing student-led pro-democracy movement in recent years. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who inherited the throne in 2016, is rarely seen in public, and spends most of his time abroad - especially after the country was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, a decision criticised by some Thais on social media. Thailand has also seen a string of corruption scandals. The most controversial was the decision to drop criminal charges against the heir of the Red Bull energy drink company in relation to a fatal traffic accident in 2012. The Thai government says it respects freedom of expression and tolerates criticism, but that students must exercise their rights within the law and must not threaten national security. But the students do fear for their safety. At least nine activists who fled overseas since the 2014 coup against the military-led government have disappeared after criticising Thailand's most revered institution. The bodies of two of them were later found on the banks of a river. The Thai government has vehemently denied it has anything to do with these disappearances. Panusaya says that since the night she delivered the manifesto, her movements have been monitored by the authorities day and night both on campus and at her dormitory. \"Although they are in plain clothes, I can tell they are police as they have the same crew cut hair style and are always taking photos of me in public places.\" She has not been arrested yet, and says she will never surrender herself to the authorities. She has also not been charged with lese majeste - the laws have been used less in recent years, at the request of the palace - but the police have issued an arrest warrant on charges of sedition, disseminating false information into a computer network and violating disease control laws, as the protests flouted coronavirus restrictions. The sedition charge alone carries a maximum jail term of seven years. And just like other students who have been accused of \"crossing the line\", Panusaya also faces tension at home. Her mother is among those horrified by her decision and pleaded with her to not go to the rally. For five days afterwards, they didn't speak to each other. \"Obviously, my mother is concerned, but she does not show it and acts normally when I am around. But when she is with my older sister, she sometimes cries,\" she says. Her mother later gave in, saying she could do whatever she saw fit - but warned her to steer clear of mentioning the monarchy. But now - as she prepares for a rally on 19 September - Panusaya is mentally preparing herself for prison.

The 82-year-old travelled to the UAE on 3 August \"and he remains there\", a spokesman said, giving no more details. The ex-king's finances are under scrutiny in a major corruption probe. He denies any wrongdoing and has said he is available if prosecutors need to interview him. Earlier this month, he announced the move in a letter to his son, Felipe, to whom he handed the throne six years ago. He said at the time was making the decision \"in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating\" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with \"tranquillity\". It was first reported that he had travelled to the Dominican Republic, but Spanish media later said he had arrived in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. However until now, neither the palace nor the government had confirmed his whereabouts. The former king is said to have travelled to the UAE on several occasions since his abdication in 2014. He is reported to be close to a number of key figures including the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan Why did Juan Carlos leave? Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after close to 40 years in power and handed power to his son Felipe. His decision to give up the throne came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. The controversies however did not stop there. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched an investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication. Juan Carlos played a pivotal role in Spain's transition to democracy after Gen Francisco Franco's death in 1975, but his popularity and his health declined in the final years of his reign, leading him to pass the baton to his son.", "summary": "西班牙王室证实，前国王胡安•卡洛斯一世已于本月3日移居阿联酋。"}

In an attempt to have clearer skies for the summit, factories have been shut down and cars barred from the roads. Many Beijingers use apps and sites to check pollution readings, including levels of dangerous PM2.5 particles. The city, which is often engulfed in a thick blanket of haze reaching well beyond healthy levels, had clear blue skies for the days leading up the summit. However on Monday as world leaders met for bilateral talks, our correspondents reported there was smog in the capital again. Most apps and sites provide a daily reading from both the city government and the US embassy reading. The US reading is considered by many to be more reliable and often shows a higher pollution count. Beijing-air.com posted a notice on its website saying it had \"received instructions from authorities saying that this month's air quality readings will be based only on what is released by the Beijing environmental protection bureau\". Fresh-Ideas Studio, which is the developer of a popular pollution-tracking app, told AFP news agency that Beijing city officials had asked that US embassy data be removed.

Ahead of the important event, Chinese authorities took measures to make sure the air would be clear. Factories in and around Beijing were shut and car use was limited. Even the burning of clothes for diseased loved ones, a Chinese traditional practice to provide for them in afterlife, was banned for the days before, during and after Apec. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli had said prior to the event that cleaning up the air was the \"priority of priorities\", according to Chinese state-media agency Xinhua News. On Monday in his opening remarks for Apec, Chinese leader Xi Jinping even acknowledged the air quality problems saying: \"These days the first thing I do in the morning is to check the air quality in Beijing, hoping that the smog won't be too bad so that our distinguished guests will be more comfortable while you are here.\" \"My hope is that every day we will see a blue sky, green mountains and clear rivers,\" he added.

Police said on Twitter that the lorry driver had been arrested, and that a passenger died from his injuries. The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in the city's west. Almost 50 people are in hospital and at least four have suffered serious injuries. Facebook set up a \"Safety Check\" page for people in Berlin to let others know they are safe. Attack as it happened Security sources cited by the German news agency DPA said that the driver of the truck was an asylum seeker from Afghanistan or Pakistan who had arrived in Germany in February. Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said a suspect believed to be the person driving the vehicle was picked up about a mile (2 kilometres) away from the crash site, near Berlin's Victory Column monument, and was being interrogated. Images of the lorry show that it was registered in neighbouring Poland. Police believe it may have been stolen from a construction site there. Police said the passenger who died was Polish. Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday. \"We haven't heard from him since this afternoon,\" he told the AFP news agency. \"We don't know what happened to him. He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him.\" Was it a terror attack? German politicians have been unwilling to call the deadly crash a terrorist attack at this stage, while many of the details remain unverified or unclear. Interior Minister Mr de Maiziere told ARD television: \"I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although many things speak for it. \"There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel has been briefed by the interior minister and the mayor of Berlin, her spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. \"We are in mourning for the dead and hope that the many injured can get help,\" he added. German President Joachim Gauck said in a statement that Monday was an \"awful evening for Berlin and for our country\". The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the Christmas market at one of the most crowded times, crashing through wooden huts and stands filled with tourists and locals. According to the DPA news agency, police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (54-87 yards) through the market area during the incident, which occurred at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT). A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press at the scene that the large lorry had missed him by only about 3m as it smashed through stands and tore down a large Christmas tree. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" said the tourist, visiting from Birmingham. He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed \"blood and bodies everywhere\". \"I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed. \"I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there.\" The site where the chaos unfolded is near a famous Berlin landmark - the Gedaechtniskirche, or memorial church, built in 1891-95. The church was damaged in World War Two bombing raids, and left as a ruin with a jagged tower as a monument to peace and reconciliation. Memories of Nice A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Monday's incident evoked memories of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, when 86 people were killed. That attack was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS). Both IS and al-Qaida have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds. Reacting to the news from Berlin, Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi tweeted: \"Horror in Berlin. Support for the mayor of Berlin and the German people. never again.\" The United States labelled the tragedy an apparent \"terrorist attack\" and pledged its support. President-elect Donald Trump blamed \"Islamist terrorists\" for a \"slaughter\" of Christians in the German capital. \"Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!\" he tweeted. Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened? You can email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your experiences.

The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray. The proposed new railway tunnel and station would form part of an extension of a high-speed line from Tel Aviv that is set to open next year. Previous Israeli excavation work around the compound behind the Western Wall, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount, has triggered Palestinian protests. The UN cultural agency Unesco, which has designated the Old City a World Heritage site, has also expressed concern about tunnelling and excavations. Mr Katz told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the extension of the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem line was the transport ministry's \"most important national project\". He said he had approved a recommendation by an Israel Railways committee to build a 3km (2-mile) underground tunnel from Binyanei HaUma station in West Jerusalem to the Western Wall, which is in occupied East Jerusalem. The tunnel would have two stations about 52m (170ft) below ground - \"City Centre\", where Jaffa and King George streets intersect - and \"Donald Trump, Western Wall\", near an ancient thoroughfare in the Old City's Jewish Quarter called the Cardo. \"The Kotel [Western Wall] is the holiest place to the Jewish people, and I have decided to name the train station leading to it after US President Donald Trump, in recognition of his brave and historic decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital,\" Mr Katz was quoted as saying. Mr Trump's declaration earlier this month, as well as his decision to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, was condemned by Palestinian leaders and sparked violent protests across the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Last week, UN member states voted decisively at the General Assembly in favour of a resolution effectively calling the US declaration \"null and void\" and demanding it be cancelled. The US rejected the resolution, saying it was merely exercising its rights as a sovereign nation, and threatened to cut financial aid to countries who voted for it. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its \"eternal and undivided\" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.", "summary": "以色列交通部长希望挖掘一条从耶路撒冷旧城（Old City）地底下穿过的隧道，并以美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的名字命名西墙（Western Wall）旁边的车站。"}

Some politicians have raised concerns this \"sweeping immunity\" encourages bad behaviour. But the chief executives say they need the law to be able to moderate content. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pichai were summoned before the Senate after both Democrats and Republicans agreed to call them in for questioning. 'A loophole' Senators are worried about both censorship and the spread of misinformation. And some industry watchers agree the legislation - known as Section 230 - needs to be revisited. \"[It] allows digital businesses to let users post things but then not be responsible for the consequences, even when they're amplifying or dampening that speech,\" Prof Fiona Scott Morton, of Yale University, told the BBC's Tech Tent podcast. \"That's very much a publishing kind of function - and newspapers have very different responsibilities. \"So we have a bit of a loophole that I think is not working well for our society.\" As the hearing began, Mr Zuckerberg vanished, unable to connect to the committee meeting - something Republican senator Roger Wicker called a \"most interesting development\". But after a brief recess, Mr Zuckerberg told politicians he supported changes to the rule \"to make sure it's working\". What is Section 230? Section 230 is the main legal protection preventing social networks being sued. It means websites themselves are not generally responsible for illegal or offensive things users post on them. They are treated as neutral middlemen - like newspaper sellers rather than the editors that decide what goes in the paper. Originally seen as a way to protect internet providers such as BT or Comcast, it has become the main shield for huge sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which cannot possibly review every post from their users before publication. But politicians say Section 230 is outdated. Democrats take issue with the spread of lies online without consequences for the sites. Republicans say big tech is using its moderation powers to censor people it does not agree with - making editorial calls rather than staying neutral. And both sides agree they want to see the social networks held accountable. Mr Dorsey told the committee Section 230 \"is the most important law protecting internet speech\" and its abolition \"will remove speech from the internet\". But he found himself faced with pointed questions over the implementation of Twitter's policies about what it removed or labelled misinformation. Asked why Twitter would label a post from US President Donald Trump about the security of mail-in ballots but leave posts by Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that threatened violence against Israel unlabelled, Mr Dorsey replied the Iranian leader's tweets were considered \"sabre rattling\", which did not violate its terms of service. Mr Dorsey also found himself facing questions from Republican senators over Twitter's limiting of a New York Post article about Joe Biden's son. \"The New York Post isn't just some random guy tweeting,\" Republican Ted Cruz said. \"Who the hell elected you and who put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?\" Mr Zuckerberg, meanwhile, revealed a \"private meeting\" with the FBI had warned firms to be wary of leaked material. He said that Facebook, and he \"assumed\" the other companies, had been warned about a possible \"hack and leak operation in the days or weeks leading up to this election\". The FBI \"suggested that we be on high alert and sensitivity, that if a trove of documents appeared that we should view that with suspicion that it might be part of a foreign manipulation attempt,\" he said. On Section 230, Mr Zuckerberg told the committee Section 230 encouraged free expression and \"helped create the internet as we know it\". But he added: \"The internet has also evolved. \"And I think that Congress should update the law, to make sure that it's working as intended.\" Mr Pichai, though, fiercely defended the law. \"Our ability to provide access to a wide range of information is only possible because of existing legal frameworks like section 230,\" he said. \"The United States adopted Section 230 early in the internet's history. \"And it has been foundational to our leadership in the tech sector.\" 'Political ploy' Both President Trump and his election rival Joe Biden have called for the removal of Section 230, though for different reasons. But some Democrats used their time to criticise the entire hearing, positioned so close to the election, as a political ploy. \"I've been an advocate of reform of Section 230 for literally 15 years,\" senator Richard Blumenthal told the committee, referring to his time as a state attorney general. \"But frankly I am appalled that my Republican colleagues are holding this hearing literally days before an election, when they seem to want to bully and browbeat the platforms here to try and tilt them towards President Trump's behaviour. \"The timing seems inexplicable.\" His colleague Brian Schatz, refusing to ask any questions of the three chief executives, \"because this is nonsense\", said: \"What is happening here is a scar on this committee and the United States Senate. \"We have to call this hearing what it is. \"It's a sham.\"", "summary": "对于Facebook、谷歌和Twitter来说，本周三又是压力重重的一天。 这三家公司的首席执行官将接受美国参议员的质询，关于社交媒体公司是否滥用权力。"}

What's going to happen next? Dr Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, says analysing a new disease is like looking at a pixelated image - when you've only rendered 30%, it's impossible to tell what the photo is. Once you load 70%, the picture gets clearer, and so on. \"We're in that 30 to 50%,\" Dr Poland says of Covid-19. \"There's a lot we genetically know about coronaviruses [and] a huge amount we don't know, clinically, epidemiologically and seasonally with regards to this virus.\" Worst case, Dr Poland says, based on early models, between 40 to 70% of the US will be infected. That's between 132 and 231 million people. One factor to consider is how Covid-19 is mutating - at a rate about once every other week. Dr Poland says it could be turning less virulent, as happens with other similar viruses. \"With 40% infected and if there was a 1.6% case fatality rate, that would be about 2.2 million people who would die, but in a real-world case scenario the fatality rate is likely to be lower than that,\" Dr Poland explains, as we don't know how many people are infected but asymptomatic, for example. \"It's a really foggy crystal ball and really difficult to make predictions.\" Dr Poland says the next best-case scenario is that doctors figure out an existing antiviral can be used to treat Covid-19. Otherwise, hopefully within the next year, scientists can develop a vaccine or other treatment therapy. \"Worst case, none of those happen in a timely manner,\" he says. \"If we don't do anything? That's tens of thousands of deaths. Hundreds of thousands possible hospitalisations.\" Even if Covid-19 drops to the level of the seasonal flu, if 40-70% people are infected, it will still cause a high number of deaths and hospital stays, especially among those 60 and older. \"These next couple of weeks are really going to be critical. Are we going to start seeing a tip over into widespread community transmission or is it going to be relatively slow? I think these next few weeks are critical and all of us in this field are holding our breath to see what happens.\" Dr Poland says based on the history of similar diseases, Covid-19 may dampen or entirely disappear in the heat of summer, like SARS did in 2003. If not, it will probably circulate until it exhausts most susceptible people. \"It really is speculation,\" he emphasises. \"What happens in China is not necessarily generalisable to the US culture, and you make your best case and try to add data point-by-point to the pixelation.\" How prepared is the overall health system? Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, warns the US healthcare system stands to be \"completely overwhelmed\" by a serious outbreak in its current state. Dr Wen, who previously served as the city of Baltimore's Public Health Commissioner, says the US is \"critically short\" of key supplies, like ventilators, protective equipment for healthcare workers and even hospital space. In a moderate outbreak as predicted by the US health agency, some 200,000 hospital intensive care beds would be required, she explains. \"There are currently less than 100,000 beds right now and most of them are occupied. If there were a need for 200,000 beds and they came within a short period of each other, then we would be in a situation like Italy and Wuhan, China, where they had to ration care...Where healthcare workers had to make difficult decisions about who will get lifesaving care and who will go without.\" Dr Wen says that without any intervention, there will be a sharp escalation in the number of infected individuals - about 5% of whom will require intensive care. How to flatten the curve? It will be essential to spread the rate of infections over a longer period of time - flattening the curve, as it were - to reduce the number of Americans who need hospital care at one time and thus keep the system from becoming overburdened. Keeping the spike of serious infections manageable is possible, Dr Wen says, depending on the actions people - and governments - take today. \"Individual and collective actions are what will make a difference in the trajectory of this illness right now,\" she says. \"Every single action that is part of social distancing is helpful. Everything is helpful. This is not a time to let perfect be the enemy of the good.\" She adds that the US \"absolutely\" needs a national response. \"This is a disease that knows no boundaries between local and state.\" And ideally, officials should ensure everyone can get tested so we know how much the coronavirus has spread in our communities, Dr Wen says. One US pathologist told the BBC that hospital laboratories across the country were ready to develop test assays five weeks ago but were unable to move forward due to existing FDA regulations. Now, as these rules have been walked back in recent weeks, labs are able to work on developing tests, a month and a half later. What about at the state level? Many of the issues in responding to the coronavirus in the US are tied to states' rights. Each state has its own specific health policies. All 50 have the capacity to declare a public health emergency and free up resources, though it may be done through different authorities in each state. Most states have now done so. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, describes the situation as a partnership at the local, state and federal levels, but one that can have gaps based on funding or differing political views about how involved the government should be. \"We are not as prepared as we should be,\" Dr Benjamin told the BBC. \"We have not had a year without a public health emergency since 2011. But this is the big one we have been predicting.\" Among the issues at play are an \"underfunded public health system, a just-in-time healthcare delivery system and an under-practiced preparedness system,\" according to Dr Benjamin. A 2020 report by the Trust for America's Health put 25 states and the nation's capital in the high health preparedness tier. Twelve were middle and 13 were deemed low. The study found public health funding, hospital safety and flu vaccination rates had improved overall, but other measures, including clean water supply and paid sick leave had \"stalled or lost ground\" in the last year. Only 30% of hospitals on average earned top patient safety grades; only 55% of workers reported access to paid leave; only 49% of Americans get a flu jab. \"The lesson from this must be to improve the infrastructure of the US public health system and sustain it; use innovation to scale up the health care delivery system and recognise preparedness as a national infrastructure that must be supported,\" Dr Benjamin says. So far, 12 states - including Florida, New York, California, and Washington state - have shut or enacted restrictions on bars and restaurants. Thirty-eight have closed public schools, along with a number of districts in other states. As the country enters mitigation mode, Dr Benjamin says he expects to see all kinds of these social distancing measures used at the state-level. \"No state is yet adequately prepared to completely respond to this pandemic,\" he adds. \"We are getting better at responding, but it remains a challenge.\" What about Canada? Last week, the Canadian government ramped up its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau advised Canadians to postpone or cancel all non-essential international travel outside of Canada. Canada announced a C$10bn ($7.1bn; £5.7bn) programme to help businesses with a \"significant\" stimulus programme coming next week. Additionally, the Bank of Canada slashed the central bank's key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.75%, the second cut this month. All cruise ships carrying over 500 passengers will not be able to dock in Canada until 1 July and the number of airports where international flights can land will be limited to enhance screening. A number of provincial governments have taken their own steps in recent days to limit contagion amid some complaints that federal counterparts had not taken an aggressive enough stance. Ontario and Quebec have closed all public schools for the next two weeks. British Columbia and Quebec have banned all public gatherings of over 250 people.", "summary": "新冠病毒的传播在美国呈稳定上升趋势，峰值还未到来。未来几周会发生什么？"}

Using physical violence the men grabbed the camera, smashed it on the road, and then escaped with it in a getaway car. During the scuffle the BBC cameraman was knocked to the ground and beaten. The team is now safe and back in Moscow. Following the attack, the team spent more than four hours being questioned at a local police station. During that time, the recording equipment left behind in the car was tampered with, our correspondent says. The hard drive of the main computer as well as several memory cards with video material had been wiped clean. Interfax quoted the head of the Astrakhan Region interior ministry's press office Petr Rusanov as saying \"a criminal case\" had been launched after police had received a report of an attack on a cameraman who had been \"beaten and robbed by unidentified persons\". The BBC said it deplored the act of violence, which it described as \"part of a co-ordinated attempt to stop accredited news journalists reporting a legitimate news story\". It has called on the Russian authorities to condemn the assault and launch a \"thorough investigation\". An official with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the attack was \"utterly and totally unacceptable\". \"What we are witnessing is a clear sign of harassment of free media in Russia,\" added the OSCE's representative on media freedom, Dunja Mijatovic.", "summary": "英国广播公司（BBC）的一个报道小组在俄罗斯南部城市阿斯特拉坎受到攻击。"}

Fortunately on this occasion, camera operator Rafa Herrero Massieu managed to release the turtle, and it swam away unharmed. \"Some scientists think that entanglement in marine plastic is the most significant welfare threat of human origin in the ocean,\" says executive producer, James Honeyborne. \"In some cases it can also be a conservation threat to entire populations.\" Episode seven looks at how tiny plastic particles (microplastics) may play a role in the uptake of industrial pollution in marine life. \"This could be contributing to high levels of chemical contamination in large predators, as in pilot whales,\" says James Honeyborne. \"It's now thought that plastics may play a role in increasing the uptake of pollutants into the body.\" There's also a problem with glitter in the sea as well... James Honeyborne told Newsbeat that it's \"critical\" for scientists to do more research into the microplastics. \"Microplastics are now so pervasive in the ocean and are consumed by a vast number of sea creatures. \"They have even been found in samples from the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of our planet.\" During filming, the team behind Blue Planet recorded all the plastic they found. \"Strangely it's often the remotest islands that have the most plastics' pollution,\" says James Honeyborne. \"That's also because there are swirling currents, known as gyres, that concentrate plastics in vast 'garbage patches' towards the centre of every ocean. \"This really is a global issue, which needs a global solution.\" The crew sometimes had to intervene when they saw how plastic was affecting wildlife. \"I have seen dead birds with their legs entangled in plastic bags, so they could have died from not being able to feed or fly,\" says Sarah Conner. \"I saw a dead leatherback turtle that died from entanglement in fishing rope.\" It's also widely reported that ingestion of plastics has lead to the deaths of many sea creatures, from turtles to albatrosses. On one occasion, the crew had to rescue an entangled humpback whale off British Columbia, which was trailing almost a kilometre of ropes from fishing pots, and was struggling to swim. \"The crew stayed with the whale for nine hours, until all the rope was removed by the rescue team and the whale was free once more,\" says James Honeyborne. Cameraman Rafa Herrero Massieu said: \"The most difficult thing was to deal with our emotions, because we could feel the great sadness that the pilot whales transmitted.\" The team also saw plastic in the regurgitated pellets of Albatross chicks on South Georgia. \"Their parents must have picked up plastic backs at sea, thinking they were edible, and have fed them to their young,\" says James Honeyborne. \"One chick had died from a plastic toothpick that had pierced its stomach.\" Watch Blue Planet 2 on BBC One on Sunday at 8pm.

Going in for treatment would be like going into battle. \"I didn't want to quietly go down as yet another cancer patient,\" says the 48-year-old, originally from Switzerland. \"I wanted to fight it. I always felt that I had an inner strength from somewhere else, from another dimension, and I feel connected to a warrior tribe.\" Two days later, Mrs Barber, who had already battled breast cancer, was introduced to Rankin. The photographer has captured glossy celebrities and models for 20 years but, struggling to deal with the deaths of his parents, was mulling a project about mortality. Mrs Barber told him about her face paint idea. \"He said, 'Fabulous, fabulous, I want to shoot you, let's do it next week,'\" she recalls. For the photo shoot, as well as paint around her eyes, she wore an impressive ruff of black and red plumage that cast her as a well-groomed warrior princess. \"I had all the feathers around my neck. Red symbolises hope and black means war. I'm battling this with everything I have. But there's always hope.\" Mrs Barber's enlarged portrait now looks down from the front of the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, which is hosting Rankin's exhibition Alive: In the Face of Death. That photo shoot led Rankin to set about photographing other people with terminal illnesses or who have had a close brush with death. This was not his usual celebrity or fashion assignment. \"My approach is always the same, which is to try and create an image that, in your gut, you feel something for,\" he says. \"This is a little bit different, in that you're collaborating and going into their lives a lot deeper than you possibly would with other projects. But it's been brilliant. If anything, it's been the most inspiring thing I've done.\" Other participants include Sam and Dan Lloyd, who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The 17-year-old twins are pictured mid-cheer, their faces daubed in the red and white of their beloved Liverpool Football Club. There is Martine Wright, the 2005 London bombings survivor turned Paralympian; Sergeant Johnson Beharry, who was wounded while serving in Iraq; and Doctor Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who has pancreatic cancer. Louise Page, who has had bone cancer for almost a decade, is photographed with fists defiantly clenched and make-up streaming down her face. \"The crying shot is very much how it feels internally for me,\" says the 42-year-old. \"That's what it's like inside my head. \"I've hidden that part of myself from everybody all these years so people have felt quite shocked by that image. \"But at the same time, they know I'm protecting and hiding things from them, and they've come to understand that's what it's like for me in reality.\" The defiance, strength and vitality on show are striking - perhaps because we are more used to the stereotypical image of the cancer 'victim'. \"That was a surprise to me,\" says Rankin. \"So many people look really healthy who are really, really ill. \"I remember when I went to Africa to do something for Oxfam, people wanted to see the victims. I don't want to show victims. \"I don't think that's what photography should be about. I think people are bored of it as well. I think they're anesthetised to it. \"I think what's interesting is trying to chip away and make people re-address or reconsider it.\" Getting to know his subjects has, Rankin says, helped him come to terms with his own fear of death. He has come to the conclusion, too, that most people in Britain are not very good at dealing with the concepts of mortality and serious illness. \"It is important that you start discussing it,\" he says. \"And if you start discussing it, you're not as scared of it and it opens it up. \"What I've learned from the project is that so many societies deal with it in different ways. We're definitely not top five. We're probably not top 100. We deal with it really badly. \"I think we do, as a society, tread on eggshells around certain subjects because we don't want confrontational conflict or pain or sadness, and I think you can definitely learn that this is not necessarily a pessimistic or sad subject. \"It can be quite empowering for you and the person you're talking to.\" Alive: In the Face of Death is at the Walker Gallery until 15 September. The exhibition has been documented by BBC Two's The Culture Show for an episode to be broadcast later in the year and is part of Liverpool's Look/13 photography festival.", "summary": "在给包括名模摩斯、麦当娜、布莱尔甚至英国女王等等世界名人拍摄肖像后，著名摄影师蓝金(Rankin)目前将自己的镜头转向了身患绝症的普通人。"}

And President Hassan Rouhani said the \"historic\" deal opened a \"new chapter\" in Iran's relations with the world. Negotiations between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - began in 2006. The so-called P5+1 want Iran to scale back its sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it cannot build a nuclear weapon. Iran, which wants crippling international sanctions lifted, has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful. Follow our live updates A good deal, for now? Deal shakes Middle East media Good or bad for Middle East? There has been stiff resistance to a deal from conservatives both in Iran and the US. The US Congress has 60 days in which to consider the deal, though Mr Obama said he would veto any attempt to block it. The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, John Boehner, said the deal would only only \"embolden\" Tehran. \"Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, this deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world,\" he added. Israel's government has also warned against an agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a \"stunning historic mistake\" that would provide Iran with \"hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe\". He said he did not regard Israel as being bound by this agreement. \"We will always defend ourselves,\" he added. In a televised address, Mr Obama insisted the deal would make the world \"safer and more secure\", and provided for a rigorous verification regime. \"This deal is not built on trust - it is built on verification,\" he said. Immediately afterwards, Mr Rouhani gave his own televised address, in which he said the prayers of Iranians had \"come true\". He said the deal would lead to the removal of all sanctions, adding: \"The sanctions regime was never successful, but at the same time it affected people's lives.'' After 12 years, world powers had finally \"recognised the nuclear activities of Iran\", he said. Analysis: Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor The agreement will change the Middle East, perhaps a lot, but at the moment no-one knows exactly how. The biggest question is whether it will reduce or increase the turmoil in the Middle East. Iran and the world's big powers, most significantly the US, now have a habit of working together - but don't assume that will help automatically to resolve the crises and wars that Iran, the US and their allies are involved with in the region. There is a danger that mutual suspicion will heat up the Middle East's fault lines, especially the cold war between Iran and Saudi Arabia - and with it sectarian conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims. But the agreement in Vienna removes Iran's nuclear programme from the danger list. Two years ago, as Israel threatened to bomb Iran, it looked likely to lead to a major Middle East war. That in itself is a major diplomatic achievement. Both Mr Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referred to the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme as an \"unnecessary crisis\". Mr Zarif said the deal was \"not perfect for anybody'', but that it was the \"best achievement possible that could be reached\". Mr Obama, who is trying to persuade a sceptical US Congress of the benefits, said it would oblige Iran to: Sanctions relief would be gradual, Mr Obama said, with an arms embargo remaining in place for five years and an embargo on missiles for eight years. Separately, the IAEA and Iran said they had signed a roadmap to resolve outstanding issues. IAEA head Yukiya Amano told reporters in Vienna, Austria, that his organisation had signed a roadmap \"for the clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme\". He called the agreement a \"significant step forward\", saying it would allow the agency to \"make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme by the end of 2015\".", "summary": "在伊朗为换取放宽国际制裁而同意签署限制自身核活动的协议之后，全球原油价格随之下跌。"}

He takes over from Steve Ballmer who announced plans to step down last year. Company founder Bill Gates said there was \"no better person to lead Microsoft\". Mr Gates is stepping down as chairman, it was also announced, but will take up a new role as a technology adviser and will also retain a seat on Microsoft's board. Microsoft's lead independent director John Thompson will take over as chairman. 'Proven leader' \"Microsoft is one of those rare companies to have truly revolutionised the world through technology, and I couldn't be more honoured to have been chosen to lead the company,\" said Mr Nadella. \"The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster and continue to transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to bring innovative products to our customers more quickly.\" Mr Nadella, 46, is Microsoft's third chief executive. The Hyderabad-born executive joined the company in 1992 and has degrees in electronics, computer science and business administration. He previously led its server and tools business before being put in charge of the unit that built Microsoft's Cloud OS service, which powers products such as Bing, Skype and Xbox Live. \"During this time of transformation, there is no better person to lead Microsoft than Satya Nadella,\" said Mr Gates. \"Satya is a proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together. His vision for how technology will be used and experienced around the world is exactly what Microsoft needs as the company enters its next chapter of expanded product innovation and growth.\" Mr Gates' appointment as a technology adviser is seen as significant, suggesting he may again take a more hands-on role in the company he founded nearly 40 years ago. In a video statement, he said the job would mean \"substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company\", working with product development teams. Experience concerns Mr Nadella's appointment ends months of speculation over who would succeed Mr Ballmer, who announced his intention to stand down in August last year. At one stage incoming chairman John Thompson said more than 100 possible candidates had been identified. Rumoured to be among them were the boss of car giant Ford, Alan Mulally, and Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop. Investors have been calling for new leadership at the Microsoft, saying it needs a significant shakeup in order to become more innovative and profitable.

He has no experience of running a company, let alone one as big as Microsoft. There are also concerns that Mr Gates and Mr Ballmer will continue to exert influence over the direction of the company. \"We do not want to see a continuation of the existing direction for the business, so it will be important that Mr Nadella be free to make changes,'' said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund.

Today he is the Chinese billionaire who holds the fate of 17,500 House of Fraser workers in his hands. Mr Yuan's Sanpower Group, a firm he founded in 1993, snapped up 89% of a struggling House of Fraser in 2014. The self-made Chinese tycoon had grand plans to save the struggling 169-year-old retail chain and turn it into a global entity. Instead, the 54-year-old is now watching his famous department chain go into administration, while 31 stores have already been earmarked for closure. So what's gone wrong? Based in eastern Nanjing in China's Jiangsu province, Sanpower Group is Mr Yuan's private multi-national conglomerate with interests ranging from pharmaceuticals to real estate and retail. Like so many big opaque Chinese conglomerates, though, it owns or has large shareholdings in several public firms at home and abroad, including Shenzhen-listed Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store - one of the oldest department store businesses on mainland China. When Mr Yuan acquired a cash-strapped House of Fraser in 2014 he thought the deal would help him expand his existing retail interests. He admired its long history, its staunchly British background, and its high-street retail reputation. He promised to help revive the firm with investments, and wanted to see it get on top of its debt. The tycoon also had grand plans for the House of Fraser brand in China, envisaging about 50 \"Oriental Fraser\" stores across the country. And he thought he could push the UK chain out as far afield as Russia. In February this year, as House of Fraser's financial worries in the UK continued, Mr Yuan seemed confident, telling the BBC's Robin Brant he still had big expansion plans for the chain in China. But to-date, as old-fashioned bricks and mortar stores continue to struggle against the global boom in online shopping, just two Oriental Fraser stores have been launched, and there's no word on Russia. Meanwhile, Nanjing Xinjiekou, the Sanpower-controlled entity that actually owns House of Fraser, has seen its shares lose almost 70% in the year-to-date. More complicated still is that earlier this month, a Beijing court froze for three years the 27% of Nanjing Xinjiekou shares that are owned by Sanpower. There's also Mr Yuan's investment in Brookstone - a US novelty mall chain in the US - which has gone belly up. Earlier this year, the chain announced it was filing for bankruptcy and closing its more than 100 stores. And finally, there's a question around the overall health of Sanpower's finances. On 23 July, the Chinese giant asked the Shanghai Stock Exchange to put a halt on trading some of its bonds, citing worries over some trades. But rumours abound it's in much deeper trouble than that after a recent debt-fuelled buying spree. Just like the Chinese giants HNA and Anbang, Mr Yuan's Sanpower has in recent years scooped up (and, in some cases, spat out) international businesses with a vengeance - including Natali, the largest private healthcare firm in Israel, and US biotech firm Dendreon. So there's no money at all? Make no mistake, Mr Yuan is rich. His real time net worth is valued by Forbes at $1b. And it seems he spreads that money around. He's received lots of awards locally, including China's Charity Person of the Year and Brand China's Man of the Year, and his relationship with Prince William through a wildlife foundation is reasonably well documented. But with House of Fraser's debts mounting, would it be so surprising if the billionaire decided to just walk away? The most recent plan to try and save House of Fraser was for Nanjing Xinjiekou (the firm that's seen its stock slide nearly 70% this year), to sell up a 51% stake in the UK retail giant. But advanced talks to sell to tourist firm Wuji Wenhua fell through earlier this year. Then just last week, a deal to sell to C.banner, which owns the toy store Hamley's, fell over too. The very latest gossip on the street is that there may be three new prospective buyers for the famous High Street chain - and that if one comes through, House of Fraser and some staff might just be saved. What Mr Yuan might think about that, though, is anybody's guess.", "summary": "他被形容为一位嗜烟如命而又头脑精明的商业谈判高手，最初是在一个卫生间旁卖电脑。"}

The scientists said the \"bimaternal\" (two mammas) animals were healthy and went on to have pups of their own. But there was bad news on the all-male front. Mice with double-dads were attempted, but died within days of being born. Why even try? The researchers were trying to answer fundamental questions about why we have sex. Mammals, including us, can make babies only through sexual reproduction - aka you need an egg from mum and a sperm from dad. But the rest of the natural world doesn't play by the same rules; some female fish, reptiles, amphibians and birds can go it alone. Welcome to the bizarre world of virgin births known officially as parthenogenesis. The aim of the Chinese researchers was to work out which rules of reproduction they needed to break to make baby mice from same-sex parents. That in turn helps understand why the rules are so important. \"It's an interesting paper... they're trying to work out what you would have to do to turn us into turkeys,\" said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge at the Francis Crick Institute. (Yes, your Christmas dinner can reproduce without having sex too.) Go on then, how did they do it? In short, with a lot of cutting-edge science. It was easier with double mums. The researchers took an egg from one mouse and a special type of cell - a haploid embryonic stem cell - from another. Both contained only half the required genetic instructions or DNA, but just bringing them together wasn't enough. The researchers had to use a technology called gene editing to delete three sets of genetic instructions to make them compatible (more on that later). The double-dad approach was slightly more complicated. It took a sperm, a male haploid embryonic stem cell, an egg that had all of its own genetic information removed and the deletion of seven genes to make it all work. So they broke the rules, what did they learn? The reason we need to have sex is because our DNA - our genetic code - behaves differently depending on whether it comes from mum or dad, the study in Cell Stem Cell suggests. And without a female copy and a male copy our whole development gets thrown out of whack. It's called genomic imprinting with parts of the DNA in sperm and parts of the DNA in eggs getting different \"stamps\" that alter how they work. Errors in genomic imprinting have been implicated in some diseases such as Angelman syndrome. The bits of DNA carrying these stamps were the ones the researchers had to delete in order to make the baby mice viable. Dr Wei Li, who conducted the experiments, said: \"This research shows us what's possible. \"We saw that the defects in bimaternal mice can be eliminated and that bipaternal reproduction barriers in mammals can also be crossed.\" So can I have a baby with my same-sex partner? Unless you're a mouse reading this, and a female one at that, then the answer is not any time soon. Dr Teresa Holm, from the University of Auckland, thinks there is a chance in the long run. \"[The research] may even lead to the development of ways for same-sex couples to reproduce healthy children of their own,\" she says. But she points out there are \"significant ethical and safety concerns that would need to be overcome\". It would not be allowed to happen until scientists could be sure any resultant children would grow up mentally and physically normal. Some people have doubts that the mice were completely OK. Dr Lovell-Badge told the BBC: \"Even with two mothers I'm not convinced they're normal and the success rate is pretty low. \"It is not something I'd hope anyone would contemplate.\" So is sex about to disappear? \"Not yet, no,\" he says.

I thought it was a spoof. It was so crass. What was going through his head? \"You can't just say sorry and then carry on like it's business as usual.

Linda Bellos, former chairwoman of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Professionals, echoed those remarks. saying: \"A lot of black players are complaining about noises being made to them. He knows this stuff,\" she told Radio 4. His tweet was \"foolish\", she said, adding: \"Never mind that it's royalty. \"The things that are happening to black children up and down the country are not enhanced by his words and I'm glad that prompt action has been taken, and let's hope we have come thoughtful dialogue and learning from this.\" Baker's Saturday Morning show on BBC Radio 5 Live won him a Sony Gold award for Speech Radio Personality of the Year in 2011, 2012 and 2014 and a Gold Award for entertainment show of the year in 2013. His irrepressible style made him one of the most popular radio presenters of his generation and saw him described by one writer as the \"ultimate geezer\". Baker was also a successful magazine journalist, scriptwriter and TV documentary maker. He wrote a number of TV shows including Pets Win Prizes and Win, Lose or Draw and, in 1990, The Game, a series about an amateur soccer team in east London. A stint at BBC London station GLR in the late '80s saw him strike up an enduring friendship with fellow broadcaster Chris Evans, and Baker would later write scripts for the Channel 4 show TFI Friday, which Evans hosted. Controversial comments It's the second time Baker has been axed by 5 Live and is the third time he has left the BBC. In 1997, he was fired for encouraging football fans to make a referee's life hell after the official had awarded a controversial penalty in an FA Cup tie. He later claimed he had never incited fans to attack the referee, only that he would have understood if they had. In 2012, two weeks before he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, he was was back in the news after an on-air rant in which he resigned and branded his bosses at BBC London \"pinheaded weasels\". The outburst came after Baker had been asked to move from a weekday programme to a weekend. In 2016, Baker took part on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here but was the first person to be voted off in the series. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Research has shown Australia is already overtaking the UK as the second biggest destination for overseas students. The government has said there is no cap on legitimate overseas student numbers. This month, the Migration Advisory Committee, which gives the government independent advice on immigration, is to report on the impact of international students - currently counted as those from outside the UK and the European Union. The government has previously rejected calls to take international students out of migration targets. 'More welcoming' The university group is arguing for a more \"welcoming\" message, by giving international students the right to stay and work in the UK when they complete their courses - as they could before the rules were changed in 2012. The US, Australia and Canada allow international students to work after graduation - and Universities UK says that their research in countries such as India has shown this to be an important attraction. It is possible for students to stay after graduating in the UK. But there are thresholds on how much graduates must be earning, time limits for moving into work and requirements for sponsorship - and the universities want a less restricted approach. Prof Sir Steve Smith, of Universities UK, said the UK was \"missing out\" on the global growth in overseas students. The UK removed the right to work after claims that overseas students were over-staying and using student visas as a back-door route for migration. But Sir Steve said such claims had proved to be \"factually incorrect\" and the latest data showed that 98% of overseas students complied with their visa requirements. As well as the financial loss from deterring overseas students, he said, there was a risk of \"extraordinary long-term damage\" in terms of losing international influence and failing to recruit international talent for UK research. After Brexit, Sir Steve said there would be even greater demand for skilled workers and the UK needed to show it was \"open for business\". 'No limit' Overall international student numbers to the UK have increased by only 3% in the past decade - while the US has increased by 40%, Australia by 45% and Canada 57%. A study from University College London in July showed that the UK's longstanding position as the second biggest recruiter, behind the US, was being lost to Australia. China is the biggest source of international students for the UK, with about 95,000 students. There are about 17,000 students from India - but Universities UK says this number has halved over the past five years. Universities UK says the spending of overseas students supports more than 200,000 jobs - with an economic impact, across fees, travel and living costs worth £25.8bn, including £1bn in tax revenues. Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said that almost a third of their students were from overseas. \"We support the call to give more international graduates the opportunity to work in the UK for a set period, once they finish their studies. This move would help preserve the UK's status as a magnet for global talent,\" said Mr Bradshaw. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK. \"We recognise the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK, which is why we have developed an excellent post-study offer. \"Graduates can stay if they get a graduate level job, get an internship or apply to set up a business in the UK. \"Completing PhD students are also able to stay for an additional year to gain work experience or set up as an entrepreneur.\"", "summary": "英国大学校长们集体呼吁政府改变现行的签证制度，恢复深受海外学生欢迎的PSW（Post study work）签证，允许来英国留学的海外学生在毕业后能滞留两年寻找工作机会。"}

It will be marked by a public holiday across the UK. The Royal Family and the Middletons will pay for the wedding itself, but the taxpayer will meet the cost of extra security and transport. The couple, both 28, got engaged while on holiday in Kenya in October. Westminster Abbey has hosted the weddings of the Queen and Queen Mother and was the venue for Princess Diana's funeral in 1997. The prince's private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, said the couple chose the Abbey for its \"staggering beauty\", 1,000-year royal history and its feeling of intimacy despite its size. He said William and Kate were \"calling the shots\" on the wedding plans, but had a \"rather large supporting cast\" to help them. \"We know that the world will be watching on April 29, and the couple are very, very keen indeed that the spectacle should be a classic example of what Britain does best,\" Mr Lowther-Pinkerton said. \"Prince William and Catherine have made it very clear that they wish everybody to be able to enjoy the day with them. \"Consequently, the day will be a proper celebration for the nation and the realms. \"Having said that, the couple are very mindful of the current situation, and for example, Prince William has already expressed a clear wish that any involvement by the armed forces should rely in great part on those servicemen and women already committed to public and ceremonial duties.\" 'National celebration' The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, welcomed the couple's choice of venue. \"We are very pleased they have chosen Westminster Abbey for their marriage and look forward to the detailed planning for what will be a great and happy occasion for the couple themselves, for their families and friends, for the country and Commonwealth and for well-wishers across the globe,\" he said. The BBC's Daniela Relph said William and Kate wanted to marry on a Friday in spring and 29 April was chosen because it fell after Easter and Lent and before a busy political programme in May and June. The extra holiday will fall in the same week as Easter Monday, giving millions of workers a three-day week. Mr Cameron said: \"We want to mark the day as one of national celebration, a public holiday will ensure the most people possible will have a chance to celebrate on the day.\" The Scottish government followed suit in declaring a public holiday. The wedding date falls six days before the Holyrood elections on 5 May. As 28 working days are needed between dissolving parliament and polling day, parliament could be dissolved a day earlier than expected. Elections to the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, some English council polls and the UK-wide referendum on voting reform are due to take place the same day. But Mr Cameron dismissed concerns that the public holiday would come too close to polling day. 'A party' \"The timing of the wedding is entirely a matter for the Royal Family. People are perfectly capable of seeing the difference... a day of celebration and a referendum and local election campaign,\" he said. Earlier, there was prolonged applause at the Church of England's general synod when the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams expressed \"delight\" at the forthcoming marriage on behalf of those present. Addressing the Queen, he said: \"Prince William and Miss Middleton will be very much in our thoughts and prayers in the months to come and we know that you and the rest of the family will be supporting them with prayer and wisdom and love as we shall all be trying to do.\" Anti-monarchy group Republic said creating a bank holiday for something \"most people are not interested in\" was \"absurd\" and that an extra day off should only be for something everyone could relate to. Prince William proposed to Kate with his mother Diana's diamond and sapphire engagement ring. Asked why he had done so, he said: \"It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well. It is only right the two are put together.\" Mr Lowther-Pinkerton said the couple were \"completely over the moon\" about their engagement. \"I've never seen two happier people,\" he added. The Press Association reported that a concert in Hyde Park had been proposed to coincide with William and Kate's wedding. It said a senior royal aide had refused to confirm the suggestion but had added: \"Their view on it would be, 'Let's have a party.'\" Meanwhile, the Bishop of Willesden, the Right Reverend Pete Broadbent, has been asked to withdraw from public ministry \"until further notice\" after he wrote on Facebook that the couple's marriage would only last for about seven years. Your comments I'm throwing a big party for my ladies and me. We are going to wear tiaras and drink champs. I'm not a massive fan of the royals but it's nice when London has something fun to celebrate. Life is so dull, it'll make a nice change. Georgina, London What a wonderful spectacle it will be celebrating the nation's treasured Royal Family in a traditional manner. Rightly the cost of the wedding is borne by the family, with the cost of security being borne by the country. The contribution this small group of people make to this country is under-recognised and such events will no doubt bring considerable numbers of tourists to this country, increasing the revenues considerably. Andrew Dodd, Wallasey My fiancee and I must be trendsetters as we booked our wedding for 29 April 2011 in Dunkeld ages ago. Only the coolest couples are getting married that day. You never know, a letter from the Queen may be on the way to all us couples getting married the same day. Hope it is nice weather and an amazing day for both weddings. Martin Farrelly, Larbert, Scotland Fantastic news about the royal wedding, but poor decision in these economic times to give everyone another day off. Especially as that time of year is littered with bank holidays that could have been used. Chris, Woking I'm wondering if any thought has been given to people such as me who are self-employed. Not only do we not get paid for the Easter Monday and, because of the institution I work at, have to take the Tuesday off also without pay. Find ourselves losing out again on the Friday, in this current climate a two-day week is the last thing I need.

He had reportedly lived in the UK for 10 years with his wife and family and disappeared from his home in west London several weeks ago. Neither the Foreign Office nor the embassy has commented.

The paper said that in this context \"a third country\" means one that is neither North nor South Korea. Analysis By the BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans North Korea has an embassy in west London. The diplomats there can be charming, particularly over curry at their favourite curry house. Their children are in nearby state schools and one is a stalwart of the local tennis club. The other side of their lives, though, involves keeping tabs on North Korean defectors who often settle in New Malden in south-west London. Two of the officials were probably the men who turned up at a barber shop in London to object to a picture in the window of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with the caption \"bad hair day\". They are also thought to have escorted Kim Jong-un's brother to an Eric Clapton concert in the Albert Hall. My friend the North Korean defector Mr Thae's main mission in London had been to spread the message that North Korea and its leadership under Kim Jong-un had been misreported and misunderstood. In one speech, he argued that it was the British who had been brainwashed by their ruling class. \"If the people in this country, or in America, knew that there is a country in the world, where there is a free education, free housing, free medical care, then they'd have second thoughts,\" he said, to laughter from his audience. \"That is the reason why the mass media creates all those shocking, terrifying stories about my country.\" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says it now looks as if Mr Thae's heart may not have been in the task of defending North Korea - one of the poorest and most authoritarian countries in the world. 'Prove valuable' \"A high-level defection, if confirmed, will be deeply embarrassing for the regime,\" said John Nilsson-Wright, an expert on Asian affairs at the London-based Chatham House think tank. \"London has always been an important diplomatic priority for the DPRK given the amount of personnel stationed there and the considerable resources devoted by the regime to maintaining its presence there,\" he added. \"The intelligence benefits to the UK and its allies from such a defection are likely to prove valuable.\"", "summary": "BBC获悉，一位在英国伦敦工作的朝鲜外交官本月初带着家人叛逃，到第三国申请避难。"}

His manager, Michael Lippman, said he had died of heart failure. Former Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley said he was \"heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend\". Writing on Twitter and referring to Michael by his family nickname of \"Yog\", he added: \"Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx\" On Instagram, Sir Elton John posted a photograph of himself with Michael, writing: \"I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans.\" Obituary: George Michael George Michael: A life in pictures How the world reacted George Michael: Six songs that defined his life Michael's family announced news of his death in a statement issued through the singer's publicist. \"It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\" it said. \"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\" South Central Ambulance Service were called to Michael's property at 13:42 GMT. Thames Valley Police also attended and Michael was confirmed dead at the scene. They added: \"At this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. A post-mortem will be undertaken in due course. \" Home village mourns George Michael A small heart wreath and a rose are among the tributes left outside the front door of Michael's home, a detached property by the River Thames. Court battle Michael, who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in north London, sold more than 100 million albums throughout a career spanning almost four decades. He first found fame with schoolfriend Ridgeley in duo Wham! - reaching number one in the UK singles charts on four occasions. One of the band's most enduring songs Last Christmas, is currently number 16 in the UK singles chart. The song was originally released in 1984 and is the biggest selling single not to reach number one. It was kept off the chart's top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas, which actually featured Michael. Solo albums followed, including the multi-million selling Faith in 1987. The follow-up Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 outsold Faith in the UK but led to Michael losing a court case with record label Sony over his frustration at how the album has been marketed. From teen idol to long-term stardom His talents as a singer, songwriter and music producer made George Michael one of the world's biggest-selling artists. Blessed with good looks and a fine singing voice, his stage presence made him a favourite on the live concert circuit as he matured from teen idol to long term stardom. But there were times when his battle with drugs and encounters with the police made lurid headlines that threatened to eclipse his musical talents. Read more in George Michael's obituary As a solo artist, Michael scored a further seven number one singles in the UK with songs including Careless Whisper and Fastlove, collaborated with the likes of Aretha Franklin and Elton John, and won three Brit Awards and two Grammys. The Grammy organisers said Michael's \"extraordinary talent had a profound impact on countless entertainers worldwide, and his creative contributions will live on forever\". Troubled artist Michael later began facing headlines for reasons other than his music. After years of refusing to be drawn on speculation about his sexuality, Michael disclosed he was gay in 1998 after being arrested in a public toilet in Beverly Hills, California, for engaging in a lewd act. The music video for the single that followed, Outside, featured a men's bathroom transformed into a disco and policemen kissing. In October 2006 he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs, and in 2008 was cautioned for possession of class A drugs, including crack cocaine. In September 2010, Michael received an eight-week prison sentence following an incident in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London. He admitted driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis. Pop stars from Michael's heyday were joined by contemporary names in paying tribute on Twitter. ABC's Martin Fry said: \"Absolutely devastated to hear of the loss of @GeorgeMichael Truly brilliant talent #sad #sad #sad.\" Duran Duran referred to the the so-called curse of 2016 - following the deaths of David Bowie, Prince and Rick Parfitt - posting on their official Twitter account: \"2016 - loss of another talented soul. All our love and sympathy to @GeorgeMichael's family.\" The band included a picture of Michael with its frontman Simon Le Bon, Sting and Bob Geldof. Madonna posted a video from 1989 on Twitter and Instagram of herself presenting Michael with an award, and wrote: \"Another Great Artist leaves us\". Robbie Williams, whose first solo single was a cover of Michael's song Freedom, wrote: \"Oh God no …I love you George …Rest In Peace x\". DJ Tony Blackburn said: \"Unbelievable, George Michael has died at the age of 53. RIP. This dreadful year goes on and on. So sad, a real talent.\" Speaking to the BBC, Paul Young recalled an impromptu duet with Michael at a Prince's Trust event in 1986. He said his voice \"cuts straight through your heart\". Boy George wrote: \"He was so loved and I hope he knew it because the sadness today is beyond words. Devastating. \"What a beautiful voice he had and his music will live on as a testament to his talent. I can't believe he is gone. I hope the Buddha will hold him in his arms.\" See more reaction to Michael's death How I featured on a George Michael song George Michael's UK number one singles In 2011, Michael postponed a series of concerts after being taken to hospital for treatment for pneumonia. After treatment in a Vienna hospital, he made a tearful appearance outside his London home and said it had been \"touch and go\" whether he lived. The experience inspired the single White Light which was his last Top 40 hit in 2012 and which he performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London. Earlier this month it was announced that producer and songwriter Naughty Boy was working with Michael on a new album. Michael had also recently been working on a documentary chronicling his rise to fame with Wham! and made a direct appeal on Twitter to his fans, asking them to send in their own videos and photographs dating from 1988 to 1996. The documentary film entitled Freedom was originally expected to be released this year but was recently delayed until next March. How George Michael inspired Carpool Karaoke phenomenon In 2011, George Michael joined James Corden for a Comic Relief sketch on BBC One which went on to inspire the hugely successful Carpool Karaoke segments on Corden's Late Late Show on CBS. The feature is now a staple of the American chat show, with stars such as Madonna and Michelle Obama having appeared, and attracts huge online audiences. The original sketch began with Corden poking fun at Michael and ended with the pair singing along to Wham!'s I'm Your Man. Corden said: \"I've loved George Michael for as long as I can remember.

Cancel order!\" The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. \"Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The new planes would enter service around 2024. Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest $50bn (£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. \"Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!\" he tweeted. In other developments: 'Could cost more' - Zoe Thomas, BBC New York business correspondent As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes. But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for $170m (£134m; €158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes. The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be $3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates. Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay. Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was \"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way\". \"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said at the time. The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was \"doing a little bit of a number\" and the cost was \"ridiculous\". \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,\" he added. A flying Oval Office Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. \"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be $3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. The US Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7bn for the project, \"but expects this number to change\". Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: \"We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. \"We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"", "summary": "美国候任总统特朗普（台湾称川普）表示，应该取消空军一号的新飞机订单，以减少政府开支。"}

The draft leaves the definition of \"undesirable\" open to interpretation. Under an existing 2012 law, foreign-funded Russian NGOs linked to politics must register as \"foreign agents\". The label has connotations of spying. A party loyal to President Vladimir Putin drafted the new law. His supporters dominate both houses of parliament. The text going through the Duma - Russia's lower house - says it will be up to Russian prosecutors and the foreign ministry to decide if a foreign organisation or firm is \"undesirable\". A foreigner declared \"undesirable\" could face a fine of up to 500,000 roubles (£6,343; $10,000) and up to six years in jail. The bill passed a second reading in the Duma on Friday. It still requires a third reading, then approval by the upper house (Federation Council) and President Putin to become law. In most cases that is a formality.

It doesn't give any criteria to define \"undesirable\", so it is not clear which organisations could be affected - the language is not precise. In theory they can punish whoever they like - businesses, media organisations. Or it could be an oil firm, or someone in the financial sphere. Non-governmental organisations are not clearly defined in Russian law. The text has been finished - there won't be more amendments now. But there might be a procedural delay before the Duma's third and final reading. Pavel Chikov, head of a human rights umbrella group called Agora, said: \"Simply declaring someone 'undesirable, we don't want to see him on our territory' will be a violation of international law and general legal principles, and of the civil legal code.\" He predicted \"a mass of disputes over interpretation of the law\". In a commentary on the draft law, the popular Russian daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said the \"undesirable\" label could be applied to any foreign organisation, \"commercial and non-profit alike\". It said NGOs such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International \"are certainly under threat\". It described the new law as a \"weapon\" that could be used \"next time relations with the West escalate, or under the influence of paranoid 'anti-Maidan' nightmares\" - referring to Russian fears of a Ukraine-style popular revolt against the government.", "summary": "俄罗斯计划实施新的规定，以国家安全为由起诉那些被视为“不受欢迎的”外国人。"}

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said the results would be \"devastating\". Mr Trump has denied making the suggestion. Hurricanes typically affect the US east coast, often causing serious damage. It's not the first time the idea has been considered. Following reports of Mr Trump's suggestion, the hashtag #ThatsHowTheApocalyseStarted has been trending on Twitter. What effect would nuking a hurricane have? Mr Trump asked why the US couldn't drop a bomb into the eye of the storm to stop it from making landfall, news site Axios said. The NOAA says that using nuclear weapons on a hurricane \"might not even alter the storm\" and the \"radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas\". The difficulty with using explosives to change hurricanes, it says, is the amount of energy needed. The heat release of a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Even though the mechanical energy of a bomb is closer to that of the storm, \"the task of focusing even half of the energy on a spot in the middle of a remote ocean would be formidable\", it adds. \"Attacking weak tropical waves or depressions before they have a chance to grow into hurricanes isn't promising either,\" says the NOAA. \"About 80 of these disturbances form every year in the Atlantic basin but only about five become hurricanes in a typical year. There is no way to tell in advance which ones will develop.\" How long has this idea been around? The idea of bombing a hurricane has been around since the 1950s when the suggestion was originally made by a government scientist. During a speech at the National Press Club in 1961, Francis Riechelderfer, head of the US Weather Bureau, said he could \"imagine the possibility of someday exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea\". The Weather Bureau would only begin acquiring nuclear weapons when \"we know what we're doing\", he added, according to National Geographic. The NOAA says the idea is often suggested during hurricane season. George Washington University Professor Sharon Squassoni says the idea stems from the Plowshares Program of the 1950s when a \"laundry list of different weird... fantastical, slightly crazy\" uses for nuclear weapons was devised by government researchers. In nearly 20 years, the US exploded 31 warheads in 27 tests in order to test whether America's nuclear arsenal could be used to excavate canals or mines, or create a harbour for ships. As the dangers of radiation became more clear, the notion was dropped, Prof Squassoni tells BBC News, adding that current international treaties would ban the US from exploding a nuclear weapon in a hurricane. Several other outlandish ideas have been floated in recent years, including one Facebook event calling for US gun owners to \"shoot down\" Hurricane Irma in 2017 with bullets and flamethrowers. The event attracted 55,000 people to sign up and was taken seriously enough by one Florida sheriff that he issued a stern warning on Twitter saying: \"You won't make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effects.\" When is the US hurricane season? The Atlantic Hurricane season runs from 1 June until the end of November. The peak of the season comes in September when sea temperatures are at their highest. Tropical Storm Dorian is currently swirling towards the Caribbean islands and is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday, and will threaten the US island territory of Puerto Rico in the coming days. When asked for a comment by BBC News, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the agency is focused on Dorian and deferred questions on the \"topic of hurricanes and nukes\" to the NOAA guidelines. The NOAA warned earlier this month that conditions were now more favourable for above-normal hurricane activity. It is predicting between 10 and 17 named storms, of which 5-9 will become hurricanes, including 2-4 major hurricanes. Four named storms have formed so far this year. They were Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dorian.", "summary": "有报道指，美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）想要尝试使用核武器消灭飓风，美国科学机构随即回应，这种想法并不可行。"}

But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \"This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. \"In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better.\" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification Dr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was \"not a terribly accurate classification system\". She told the BBC: \"This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease.\" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: \"There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. \"Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow.\" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: \"Clearly this is only the first step. \"We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes.\" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help \"personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future\". She added: \"This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "瑞典和芬兰的科研人员说，人们常说的糖尿病实际是一种非常复杂的疾病，它可以分成5种不同的疾病。"}

What is a mochi? The cakes, known as mochi, are cute round buns made of soft and chewy rice. The rice is first steamed and then pounded and mashed. The resulting sticky rice mass is then formed into the final mochi shape and baked or boiled. Families traditionally celebrate New Year by cooking a vegetable broth in which they heat the mochi. How do they kill? The buns are chewy and sticky. Given they are far bigger than bite-sized, they need to be laboriously chewed before swallowing. Anyone who can't chew properly - like children, or the elderly - will be likely to find them hard to eat. If not chewed but simply swallowed, the sticky mochi gets stuck in the throat - and can lead to suffocation. According to Japanese media, 90% of those rushed to hospital from choking on their new year's dish are people aged 65 or older. What's a safe way to eat them? Chew, chew, chew. If that's not possible, the rice cakes need to be cut into smaller pieces. Each year, authorities issue public warnings in the run-up to the new year festivities advising that people - especially the very young and elderly - should only eat mochi cut down to smaller little chunks. Yet despite the warnings, each year there continue to be deaths linked to the dish. At the turn of 2014 to 2015, the number of casualties peaked at nine. In 2016 it was one, while last year two people died. Each year, many more end up in critical condition in hospitals across the country. You may also like: Picture perfect?

Russia said Capt Murakhtin was rescued from rebel-held territory in Syria in a 12-hour operation involving special forces. Turkey says the pilots were warned 10 times before the plane was shot down. It is not clear what happened to the body of his co-pilot, who was killed by gunfire as he parachuted from the burning plane. Capt Murakhtin was speaking from the Hmeymim airbase, where Russia's aircraft have been based in its Syrian campaign, and where he was taken after being rescued. He said he knew the region he had been flying in \"very well\" and that the jet had not been in Turkish airspace \"even for a second\". He added he wanted to go back to duty and stay at the airbase, saying \"someone has to pay\" for the death of the other pilot, Lt Col Oleg Peshkov. Russia has been carrying out air strikes against opponents of President Bashar al-Assad since late September. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Lt Col Peshkov would be posthumously awarded the Star of the Hero of Russia. There are also to be state awards too for Capt Murakhtin and the marine who died during his rescue, Alexander Pozynich. Analysis: Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow Clearly furious, President Putin has threatened \"serious consequences\" after Turkey hit the Russian jet. But so far concrete measures have been limited. Russia's foreign minister spent a fraught hour on the phone to his Turkish counterpart today, but his conclusion was critical: \"We do not intend to go to war with Turkey,\" Sergei Lavrov assured the world. Instead, ministries have been ordered to report back to the Kremlin on any projects involving Turkey, for a decision on possible sanctions. The future of a pipeline project could be in doubt and there have been calls for flights to Turkey to be suspended. Meanwhile, tourists have been warned against travelling there for \"security reasons\". Last year, Turkey was the destination of choice for over three million Russian holidaymakers. On the ground inside Syria the changes have been more immediate. A cruiser has been despatched to help bolster air defences around the Russian base. The sophisticated S400 anti-aircraft system is also being deployed and Russian planes will now be protected on bombing raids by fighter jets. The message to Turkey and its allies is clear: Don't dare try it again. Tensions have escalated between the two countries over the incident, and Russia has broken off military contacts with Turkey. The US, the EU and the UN have all appealed for calm. President Putin has described the downing of the plane as a \"stab in the back\", and warned of serious consequences. His Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the incident was a \"planned provocation\" but Russia did not want to wage war over the shooting, Reuters reports. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended the action, saying \"everyone must respect the right of Turkey to protect its borders\". He has said he does not want to escalate tensions further. Turkey is a member of Nato. The alliance has backed Turkey's version of events, although it, too, is calling for \"diplomacy and de-escalation\" to resolve the situation. Russian defence officials say the plane never entered Turkish territory, and that Turkish pilots made no attempt to communicate with the Russians before they fired. The Turkish military has released an audio recording of what it says is a series of warnings to the Russian jet to change its course. The Turkish General Staff put out a statement saying it had been in touch with Russian military attaches to explain the rules of engagement that led to the downing of the jet and that it had tried to rescue the pilots. Russia has announced fighter jets will now escort its bombers during air strikes over Syria, and Moscow is sending out its most advanced anti-aircraft missile system, the S-400. Russia and Turkey have found themselves on opposing sides in Syria's conflict, with Russia supporting President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey is a staunch critic. Turkey is part of the US-led coalition against the so-called Islamic State (IS) group. US President Barack Obama says the coalition has carried out 8,000 strikes against IS since it began. Heated Turkey-Russia rhetoric While they talk of not wanting to escalate tensions, both Russia and Turkey had some harsh words for each other on Wednesday: \"We have serious doubts about this being an unpremeditated act, it really looks like a planned provocation\" - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Turkey's downing of the jet. \"We should be honest here. Supporting someone who is practising state terror... if you confirm, if you approve violence or oppression you are [an] oppressor,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an apparent reference to Russia's support for Syria's President Assad. \"The problem is not the tragedy we witnessed yesterday. The problem is much deeper. We observe... that the current Turkish leadership over a significant number of years has been pursuing a deliberate policy of supporting the Islamicisation of their country,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin on Turkey. \"No-one can legitimise attacks on Turkmen in Syria using the pretext of fighting the Islamic State,\" Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu suggesting Russia is not being honest about its targets in Syria.", "summary": "被土耳其击落的俄罗斯战机的一名生存机员说，土耳其在发动攻击前没有发出警告，而且他的飞机也没有进入土耳其领空。"}

The UK would work with its allies to take appropriate action, he insisted. China's UK ambassador said talk of concentration camps was \"fake\". Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country. Shown drone footage that appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains, and which has been authenticated by Australian security services, he said he \"did not know\" what the video was showing and \"sometimes you have a transfer of prisoners, in any country\". \"There is no such concentration camps in Xinjiang,\" he added. \"There's a lot of fake accusations against China.\" It is believed that up to a million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what the Chinese state defines as \"re-education camps\". China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. The authorities have recently been accused of forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the population, prompting calls for the UN to investigate. 'Deeply troubling' Asked whether the treatment of the Uighurs met the legal definition of genocide, Mr Raab said the international community had to be \"careful\" before making such claims. But he said: \"Whatever the legal label, it is clear that gross, egregious human rights abuses are going on. According to recent research by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, the rate of population growth in the two largest Uighur prefectures in Xinjiang fell by more than 80% between 2013 and 2018. China does not accept the findings and pressed on the figures, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said that the Uighur population in Xinjiang stood at four to five million 40 years ago and had now grown to 11 million. ''People say we have ethnic cleansing, but the population has doubled,'' he added. Demographic research, which draws on Chinese official data and media reports, doesn't go back as far as 40 years. But it suggests there was a rapid rise in the growth rate of the population in Xinjiang between 2005 and 2015, followed by a sharp fall over subsequent years. \"It is deeply, deeply troubling and the reports on the human aspect of this - from forced sterilisation to the education camps - are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time. \"We want a positive relationship with China but we can't see behaviour like that and not call it out.\" There are growing calls for the UK to impose sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans, on Chinese officials responsible for the persecution of the Uighurs. A petition backing the move has amassed more than 100,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament. Coverage of China's hidden camps The UK recently took action against senior generals in Myanmar who orchestrated the campaign of violence against the Rohingya and against North Korean bodies behind forced labour camps. Mr Raab said this showed that the UK was prepared to take action unilaterally, as well as through bodies like the UN, but it was \"not as simple as deciding you can willy nilly sanction X or Y\". \"You have to, as we have done with the Rohingya and North Korea, build up an evidence base and that takes a long time to do because you have got to identify accurately and responsibly those involved,\" he said. BBC News diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: \"The risk for Britain is that it gets caught in the crossfire between Washington and Beijing. \"The price for defending human rights could be less trade with China - and that could prove costly in a post-Covid economic downturn.\" Conservative MPs are also pressing for action against senior officials in the Hong Kong government following the imposition of a new security law which the UK says violates international agreements protecting freedoms. The foreign secretary is due to update Parliament on Monday on the UK's response, amid speculation it will scrap the UK's existing extradition treaty with the former British colony. 'Tit-for-tat' Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the Chinese ambassador said if the UK - which has also offered residency rights to three million Hong Kongers eligible for British passports - targeted its officials, his country could retaliate. \"If the UK goes that far to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, China will certainly make a resolute response to it,\" he said. He dismissed claims of \"ethnic cleansing\" of the Uighurs as baseless, saying they \"enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people\". He said figures suggesting population growth in Uighur areas had fallen by 84% between 2015 and 2018 were \"not correct\", claiming the number of Uighurs in the whole of Xinjiang had \"doubled\" over the past four decades. \"There is no so-called pervasive, massive forced sterilisation among Uighur people in China,\" he added. \"Government policy is strongly opposed to this kind of practice.\" While he \"cannot rule out single cases\" of sterilisation, he insisted \"we treat every ethnic group as equal\".", "summary": "英国外交大臣拉布（Dominic Raab）在伦敦时间7月19日（周日）表示，中国侵犯维吾尔族人口人权，行为“严重且极其恶劣”，不排除英国会因此制裁中国。"}

A sequel was in the works and due to come out in 2022, with Boseman set to return. The news of his death came as a shock to many as Boseman never discussed his diagnosis publicly.

On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat. 'National security' fear \"ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,\" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying. Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were \"dangerous political distractions\". \"Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.\" While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies. \"China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. \"Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.\" The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement. Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations. \"We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,\" Mr Rogers said on Monday. On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS. \"If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" he said. Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming \"more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations\". China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to \"set aside prejudices\" regarding the two firms. \"Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,\" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. \"Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.\" Espionage fears Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987. As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced. There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied. Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel. Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China. Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September. ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal. Political distraction? This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms. Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon. It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years. The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority.", "summary": "美国众议院情报委员会经过近一年的调查后认定中国通讯企业华为和中兴对美国的国家安全构成威胁。"}

Many mass shooting suspects in the US have three things in common: They are young, white and male. The suspect behind the El Paso shooting that killed 22 people in Texas is believed to have posted a racist manifesto online. Police investigating a deadly attack in Dayton the following day said the gunman was influenced by a \"violent ideology\", although no motive has been disclosed. The dangers of the internet are not a novel talking point for parents and teachers, but these most recent tragedies have sparked renewed debate over what families can - and should - do when it comes to raising white boys in America. \"The red flags started going up for us when, a year or so ago, [our kids] started asking questions that felt like they came directly from alt-right talking points,\" says Joanna Schroeder, a Los Angeles-based writer, media critic and mother of three. She tells the BBC one of her two sons began to argue \"'jokey'-toned alt right positions\", asking questions like why black people could \"copy white culture but white people can't copy black culture\". She began learning about how other boys their age were sharing sexist and racist memes - likely spreading from online forums. Last week, Ms Schroeder's Twitter thread about parenting white boys in a world rife with easy access to extremist viewpoints by monitoring their social media and teaching empathy became a widespread talking point, amassing nearly 180,000 likes, 8,500 comments and shares across social platforms. \"Not all jokes indicate your kid is buying into dangerous ideology,\" she says. \"The bigger question for parents to ask themselves when their kids make racist, sexist or homophobic jokes is whether their kids understand the deeper implications of what they're saying.\" But some derided her suggestions to track social media as an infringement on a child's privacy and an overreaction. Others said the arguments did not apply just to white boys, and focusing on one race made the issue problematically less inclusive. They also pointed the finger at mainstream media for conflating conservative or non-liberal views and values with bigotry and white supremacy. Some experts say social media algorithms are fuelling a worldwide rise in extremist views or conspiracies by creating echo-chambers online. And while it's certainly not just boys who are affected by internet propaganda, in the US at least, it seems that it is driving young men in particular to lash out most violently. One teenager who replied to Ms Schroeder's tweet said: \"I've seen this happen to people that I was surrounded by in high school. Watched how the divide formed between those that were heavily affected and those that weren't.\" A gaming video on YouTube could include a suggestion to something political, for example. \"And that is likely to be content carefully curated to attract young men,\" Ms Schroeder says. \"After they watch one of those, the next videos in the series may grow more and more extreme.\" Earlier this month, the New York Times published an investigation into the ways YouTube helped empower Brazil's far-right by systematically recommending conspiracy channels and far-right content to its users. The Times reported that the effects of directing viewers to this content have been seen in Brazilian schools, its public health system, and of course, politics. Ahead of his election, President Jair Bolsonaro was a star in Brazil's far-right YouTube community. Tom Rademacher, an eighth grade teacher in Minnesota, says schools can do more to step in and \"interrupt some of this radicalisation\" without knocking down any particular political or ideological groups. \"We should be teaching critical thinking and empathy. We shouldn't be teaching kids what to think, but we can teach kids how to listen to people who think differently from them.\" 'Domestic terrorism' The motivation behind mass shootings can vary enormously, and sometimes the police are unable to find a reason at all. But the FBI is increasingly ready to class such attacks as \"domestic terror\" when appropriate - as it did recently with El Paso and the garlic festival tragedy in California - which means it believes there is a connection to a US-based group espousing a violent ideology. In July, FBI director Christopher Wray told the Senate that the majority of domestic terrorism cases were \"motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence\". Sociology Prof Margaret Hagerman at Mississippi State University spent two years studying a group of affluent white families and the way they discussed and taught about race. Prof Hagerman says she was surprised to learn that many of these parents believed their children had no ideas about race and were \"colourblind\". \"When I spent time one-on-one with the kids or when they were with friends it was very apparent they had all kinds of ideas about race, racism and inequality,\" she says. \"Children are learning about race in America through all different aspects of their everyday lives.\" She says parents should think about how they construct their child's upbringing, and how living in a primarily white neighbourhood and going to a primarily white school, for example, might \"convey particular messages\" that leave children unprepared to deal with encountering things like white supremacist ideologies online. \"I often hear parents tell me they feel uncomfortable talking about racism with other adults. I'm struck by that, because if white adults can't have conversations about racism in America with other white adults, I don't understand how they think they're prepared to have those conversations with children.\" Mr Rademacher described one group of white boys in his classroom who repeatedly mocked race, gender and sexuality in a way he believes came from online forums. Scolding did nothing to curb the behaviour, so Mr Rademacher invited them for a discussion over lunch instead. One student told him that \"as white boys, they were so consistently worried about being called racist that they made jokes to each other within their private group chat almost as a form of gallows humour - to toy with the thing that they were most scared of, felt the most attacked for.\" Mr Rademacher says that after a conversation about how to share their feelings, some of the boys even joined the school's anti-racist leadership group. \"They're still young boys,\" Mr Rademacher emphasises. \"They're trying to figure out where the line is. Why things are funny and why things are offensive.\" And white teenagers are \"ripe for radicalisation\" now amid broader cultural changes that make them \"feel like they're under attack\" from mainstream society, he says. Meme-culture, gamer-culture and white nationalist culture can overlap and inform each other, he adds, and it's all too easy for them to start with one and travel to the other without knowing it. What can be done? Ms Schroeder says parents need to intervene because children will not often stop to critically examine the arguments they hear online. Ask where they heard the remark and say you want to understand the context, she suggests. \"I always try to start with, 'I know you never want to hurt anyone, so I want to explain to you why that joke isn't appropriate and why it's hurtful. That way you'll know why we don't want you to say that again.'\" Mr Rademacher says it's important teachers keep in mind that parents can get defensive too if their children are shamed. \"Emailing a parent and saying I think your kid is going to be a white nationalist - that's irresponsible.\" But many parents are worried about what their children have access to online. \"The dumb mistakes we used to make are now the dumb mistakes that make you national news for a week. So if you can have parents be partners in that situation it's a lot better.\" Mr Rademacher says that implementing some of these ideas into a yearlong curriculum would be an easy way to tackle internet radicalisation. But parents who fear it would be \"anti-white\" are mistaken. \"What I mean is the classroom can be a place where kids can explore without being shamed. When we apply shame to a group we are pushing them down a much more negative path.\" In Ms Schroeder's words: \"Our kids need to know that we expect them to be kind, respectful and honest - not because we think they aren't those things already - but because we know that they have innate goodness inside of them.\"", "summary": "最近，一名母亲发布的一个帖子在网上传开。她认为男孩们在使用互联网的时候受到极端主义的思想毒害，表示相当担忧。她认为这对于家长来说是一个警讯。"}

But while there was a pick-up in new orders, March output was also boosted by clearing backlogs of existing work. Markit saidthat conditions in the sector remained tough, with firms facing high oil and metal prices. But it said that both domestic and overseas demand had improved. \"UK manufacturing has made a brighter than expected start to 2012, with PMI data pointing to output growth of around 0.3% in the first quarter,\" Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said. \"This is obviously nowhere near a strong pace, but it is at least sufficient to prevent the sector from remaining a drag on broader GDP growth. \"Inflows of domestic and export orders also showed some improvement in March, but exporters are having to tap markets further afield as conditions in the eurozone remain lethargic.\" 'Break the cycle' New orders rose at their quickest pace for a year in March, the data showed. In another encouraging sign, the PMI for February was also revised upwards to 51.5 from a previously-stated 51.2. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said the figures indicated that the manufacturing sector performed reasonably strongly in the first quarter, \"which interestingly is not being confirmed so far by the ONS's official numbers\". \"We'll wait and see what the services figures look like later in the week, but I still suspect that these are consistent with a GDP growth rate of somewhere in the region of 0.2%,\" he said. \"It would therefore break the cycle that was represented by the sharp decline in Q4.\" The service sector PMI figures will be released on Wednesday. The manufacturing survey indicated output growth of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2012 after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of last year.

She voiced fears that it was impossible to say if the object may be a weapon. Russia has dismissed the comments as \"unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions\". The satellite in question was launched in October last year. \"[The satellite's] behaviour on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before from on-orbit inspection or space situational awareness capabilities, including other Russian inspection satellite activities,\" Ms Poblete told the conference on disarmament in Switzerland. \"Russian intentions with respect to this satellite are unclear and are obviously a very troubling development,\" she added, citing recent comments made by the commander of Russia's Space Forces, who said adopting \"new prototypes of weapons\" was a key objective for the force. Ms Poblete said that the US had \"serious concerns\" that Russia was developing anti-satellite weapons. Alexander Deyneko, a senior Russian diplomat, told the Reuters news agency that the comments were \"the same unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions, on suppositions and so on\". He called on the US to contribute to a Russian-Chinese treaty that seeks to prevent an arms race in space. 'Lasers or microwaves' Space weapons may be designed to cause damage in more subtle ways than traditional weapons like guns, which could cause a lot of debris in orbit, explained Alexandra Stickings, a space security expert at the Royal United Services Institute. \"[Such weapons may include] lasers or microwave frequencies that could just stop [a satellite] working for a time, either disable it permanently without destroying it or disrupt it via jamming,\" she said. But it was difficult to know what technology is available because so much information on space-based capabilities is classified, she added. She also said it would be very difficult to prove that any event causing interference in space was an intentional, hostile action by a specific nation state. Ms Poblete's comments were particularly interesting in light of President Donald Trump's decision to launch a sixth branch of the US armed forces named Space Force, added Ms Stickings. \"The narrative coming from the US is, 'space was really peaceful, now look at what the Russians and Chinese are doing' - ignoring the fact that the US has developed its own capabilities.\" A spokesman for the UK's Ministry of Defence said he could neither confirm nor deny any tracking of Russian satellites. \"There are a range of threats and hazards to all space capabilities in what is an increasingly contested domain,\" he said. \"These include the development of counter-space weapons by a number of nations. \"The UK is working closely with international allies, including the US, to re-enforce responsible and safe behaviours in space and to build knowledge, understanding and resilience.\"", "summary": "一个神秘的俄罗斯卫星\"举止反常\"引起美国关注，美国就这个绕地卫星轨道的\"反常行为\"向俄罗斯提出质询。"}

Apple's lawyers in Sydney claimed that Samsung's Galaxy Tab infringed patents relating to its touchscreen interface. In the Hague, Samsung launched a counter attack, seeking an embargo on iPads and iPhones over 3G patents. To date, Apple has been more successful in using the courts to hamper its rival's commercial ambitions. Samsung has yet to score a significant victory against Apple, although it has filed suits in a number of countries, including France and South Korea. Both companies also have actions pending in the United States. Look and feel In Monday's Australian hearing, Apple attorney Steven Burley told the court that the rival tablet resembled the iPad 2 in \"form, factor and shape\" according to the AFP news agency. \"It must have been as plain as the (Sydney) Opera House to Samsung that the Apple patents were right in front of its eyes, and they were wide open,\" he added. The discussion of both products' look and feel was similar to arguments laid out in earlier European cases, although Apple is also claiming that specific patents have been infringed. These relate to the Galaxy Tab's unlocking, scrolling and zooming features, said the Sydney Morning Herald. Samsung has reportedly filed a counter-claim in Australia, based on 3G mobile telecoms patents it holds. Those pieces of technology also formed the basis of Samsung's claim in the Netherlands. The Korean manufacturer claimed that Apple failed to license patented designs used inside the iPhone and iPad. Apple argued that it should not have to, because it is already making payment to Intel and Infineon which, in turn, license those Samsung patents. A Dutch reporter for Webwereld, Andreas Udo de Haes, tweeted from the court that Samsung said it had offered licensing terms that were rejected by its US rival. As the hearing continued, patent blogger Florian Mueller told BBC News: \"I believe an injunction is rather unlikely. Samsung may be entitled to a royalty payment, which requires some detailed technical analysis, but Apple will most likely continue to be able to sell.\"", "summary": "苹果公司与三星公司的高调产权官司一波三折，双方再次诉诸法庭。"}

Sources suggest the girls entered Syria near the Kilis border crossing. Bethnal Green Academy pupils Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, travelled to Istanbul on 17 February. They flew from Gatwick to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. The Metropolitan Police said it \"now had reason to believe that they are no longer in Turkey and have crossed into Syria\". \"Officers continue to work closely with the Turkish authorities on this investigation,\" the force said in a statement. 'Out of reach' Sources inside Syria suggest three girls who were identified as British - including one said to be wearing glasses - crossed the border with the help of people smugglers. The news comes after the girls' families made a number of emotional appeals for them to return. BBC correspondent James Reynolds said it was \"not clear what - if anything - British or Turkish authorities are now able to do\". He said the fear was that once inside Syria, the missing schoolgirls would be \"out of reach\". Ross Frenett, from the think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said the girls' long-term prospects were concerning. \"It seems likely they're going to get married pretty quickly and then probably settle into some kind of domestic life,\" he said. \"The worry is more what happens in the long term, because as [Islamic State] tends to lose territory, this idea of just settling down and helping it from the back end won't necessarily work any more. Turkish criticism \"We could see women taking a more active role in this conflict and that's a real worry here.\" Earlier, Scotland Yard denied it had taken three days to inform officials in Turkey about the schoolgirls travelling to Syria. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said officials would have taken \"necessary measures\" had they known earlier. But the Met has said it began working with Turkish authorities a day after the girls went missing. Mr Arinc said: \"It is a condemnable act for Britain to let three girls... come to Istanbul and then let us know three days later. \"They haven't taken the necessary measures. The search is ongoing. \"It would be great if we can find them. But if we can't, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British.\" 'Great assistance' Scotland Yard said officers made contact with the foreign liaison officer at the Turkish Embassy in London on 18 February - the day after the girls left the UK. \"Since then we have been working closely with the Turkish authorities who are providing great assistance and support to our investigation,\" a spokesman added. A public appeal for information about the missing girls was launched by police on Friday, three days after the girls boarded their flight to Turkey. UK police officers have also travelled to Turkey - although their role in the country has not been confirmed.

LU said up to 190 of 270 stations were open, but a full service could not resume immediately because of shift patterns. Further industrial action is planned for Friday between 09:30 and 11:30 and 18:30 to 20:30, when the unions are asking members to leave ticket barriers open. They are also urging members not to issue penalty fares. LU's chief operating officer Phil Hufton said the company was \"not obliged to pay employees in full if they refuse to carry out their full range of contractual duties\". Earlier Transport for London (TfL) said nine of the 11 lines were running and nearly 75% of stations were open, more than on Wednesday. For a second day millions of commuters were affected, many to relying on buses instead of the Underground. 'Wiggle room' Ahead of Friday's planned talks, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson told BBC London 94.9, there was \"wiggle room\". He apologised to people who had experienced disruption and repeated that he thought passengers would be safer and better protected with members of staff on concourses, instead of \"behind plate glass\". The mayor said the unions had shown a \"failure to engage\" in talks, adding: \"Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses they should have been talking to TfL this week.\" 'Get serious' RMT leader Bob Crow said it was the first he had heard of \"wiggle room\", adding: \"My negotiators have been told for the last five weeks there is none.\" TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said it was time for the mayor to \"get serious\", saying 70% of the network was at a standstill. He said: \"We want no more stunts or PR baloney from Boris. We want serious and detailed talks on our genuine fears for the safety and security of passengers and staff under these far-reaching plans.\" James, from Harrow, who supervises a small station, told BBC London 94.9 he was worried about his job and the safety implications of the changes. He said he was currently a supervisor at one station and had one other staff member with him. Under the changes, he would have to oversee five stations. He said: \"I don't want to strike. It's the first time I've ever been on strike. \"But there are incidents every day - someone who is blind, or someone who wants guidance. Very rarely do you have one person at a station.\" Police staff Philip, from Croydon, works in a ticket office and said workers still had to handle lots of Oyster-related problems, including visitors from overseas wanting refunds before they return home. TfL has said its proposed changes, which will lead to 960 job losses - but none compulsory - will modernise systems and save £50m a year. The industrial action came as the government said it was considering plans to declare London Underground an essential service, akin to the police, in order to curb the threat of future strikes. Thousands of Metropolitan Police civilian staff are planning to strike for two days in a row over a 1% wage rise. The action will coincide with the next planned 48-hour Tube strike.

In the latest incident about 1,016kg (2,242lb) of cocaine and 6,350kg of marijuana suspected of being transported through the tunnel was seized, officials say. \"This is the largest cocaine seizure ever associated with a tunnel,\" Southern California District Attorney Laura Duffy said, and is the second \"super tunnel\" to be discovered in recent weeks, In March, authorities uncovered a 380m tunnel that ran from a restaurant in Mexico to a house in California. The latest tunnel ran at a depth of 14m (46ft) from the bottom of an elevator shaft built into a house in Tijuana to a hole in the ground on the American side enclosed within a fenced-in lot set up as a pallet business. The hole was hidden under a trailer-sized rubbish bin that smugglers used to move the drugs from the lot, federal officials said. \"They put the drugs in the dumpster and then hauled the dumpster to another location to unload it,\" Ms Duffy said. Federal agents followed a truck that took the bin to a central San Diego location about 40km (25 miles) north of the border and witnessed the cargo being loaded onto a box truck, which drove away. San Diego County sheriff's deputies then stopped the truck and seized the drugs, arresting three men in the process. Ms Duffy said that federal agents searching the pallet lot and the tunnel recovered additional supplies of marijuana and arrested three more suspects. The tunnel used in the operation was sophisticated, The Los Angeles Times reported, and had a ventilation system and lighting. On the Tijuana side, the tunnel was connected to an elevator that ascended into the house. \"I think it fair to say that few would suspect that traffickers were moving multi-ton quantities of cocaine and marijuana in this very unassuming way, in full view of the world around them,\" the paper quoted Ms Duffy as saying. \"It's a rabbit hole,'' she said of the latest tunnel to be found. \"Just the whole way that it comes up right out into the open is a bit ingenious.

He says he became \"gripped by anxiety, and the fear of cancer coming back, or the fear that maybe it hadn't gone\". \"I felt guilty, angry at myself,\" says Mr Trout, now 37 and from Thames Ditton in south-west London. \"At times I was thinking 'am I ungrateful for feeling this way after having survived when so many others don't?'.\" Read more about his story Prof Jane Maher, chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \"We now see fewer of the big side-effects, such as an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, we saw after treatment in the 1970s and 80s. \"But some of the effects doctors consider 'small', such as fatigue and poor bowel control, can have a profound impact on someone's quality of life. \"Sadly there is no cancer treatment available at the moment that does not carry a risk of side-effects.\" The charity said although a growing number of people are surviving long-term with cancer, more needed to be done to make sure they got the right care. The organisation says it has evolved from being a handful of nurses providing end-of-life care in the 1970s to a much bigger network that even includes benefits advisers. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the fact more people were surviving cancer was \"excellent news\" and credited the work of NHS staff carrying out diagnosis, treatment and care to help patients. \"To help, we announced last year that by 2020 people diagnosed with cancer in England will benefit from an individually tailored recovery package,\" he said. 'Increasing pressures' Meanwhile the Welsh government said it welcomed the improvements, but a spokeswoman said \"the numbers of people experiencing cancer in their lifetime are increasing and this is set against a backdrop of increasing pressures on NHS resources\". Nell Barrie, of Cancer Research UK, also stressed it was important to continue focusing on \"world-leading science to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment, especially for the harder-to-treat cancers like lung, brain and pancreatic cancer\".", "summary": "根据英国癌症关怀慈善机构麦克米兰癌症援助的一份报告说，目前英国有17万多癌症患者在被诊断癌症之后，存活了几十年，最多达40年。"}

But in 2018, a year after the world watched the horrific expulsion and mass murder of the Rohingya people - an alleged genocide - Aung San Suu Kyi opted for the phrase \"rather sweet\" to describe the generals in her cabinet. Three years on, as she sits under house arrest once again - the victim of the swiftest of coups - her decision to defend the army, either for personal, political or patriotic reasons, looks a very bad one. Her supporters will tell you she was in an impossible position and that taking a tougher stance would have hastened her incarceration. Her critics insist she still could have shown at least a flicker of compassion for the persecuted Muslim minority. Either way, her prospects and those of a democratic Myanmar look bleak. While her international halo may have slipped and shattered, Aung San Suu Kyi is still adored by tens of millions in Myanmar. This popularity cannot be overstated. The thumping general election victory for her National League for Democracy saw them win more than 80% of the vote. If you wander the crumbling streets of downtown Yangon - with the canopy of tangled power wires overhead and the occasional scurry of cat-sized rats at your feet - and pop your head into any doorway, there's one face you're more than likely to meet. Whether it's on a poster, a painting or a calendar, Mother Suu's image looks backs at you. These are the same streets which now after dark reverberate with the clanging of pots in support of their democratically elected - and now summarily detained - leader. \"We normally make this noise to drive out evil spirits,\" explained Ma Khin in a description to her social media post. \"Now we want to drive the military out so that Aung San Suu Kyi can be free.\" As well as the din of the pans, a much more soothing sound fills the warm night air. The songs of the 1988 Uprising - that upswell of democratic fervour that propelled a young Suu Kyi into the domestic and international limelight, and precipitated her first of many periods under house arrest. Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya human rights activist, captioned her own uploaded street video with the words \"very painful to see\" as she recalled singing the revolutionary verses in jail with fellow political prisoners. In the footage, I was struck by an image which epitomises a defining irony in the violent, twisted and tragically repetitive history of Myanmar. Illuminated by the light of smartphones held aloft, there was a portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi's father - General Aung San: the still-revered leader, assassinated in his prime in 1947 before he could guide Burma into independence from the British. He was also the founder of the modern Burmese army, also known as the Tatmadaw: the very institution now depriving his daughter of her liberty and his country of their leader. Again. The same mobile phones that keep the memory of her father burning brightly could yet lead Aung San Suu Kyi from the darkness. For if previous struggles for freedom - in 1988 and 2007 (the Saffron Revolution) - were played out on the streets, this one will be powered online. On Facebook to be precise, the platform that millions of Burmese use above all others to send and receive their news and views. This, of course, if the army doesn't persist in blocking access to the site and app. Because the military, whose senior command are now banned from Facebook after using it to such devastating effect in the last decade to whip up nationalist sentiment, spread hate speech and fake news, know its power. And fear it, you'd imagine. The Tatmadaw's capacity for murderous brutality - in slaying their own people, students and monks seeking freedom - cannot be beaten. But they are pulverised in any fight for Burmese hearts and minds. The problem for Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters is harnessing this digital power. Many were taken aback by the directness of her purported plea in a letter to \"protest against the coup\". Some feared it may be a military trap, to lure protestors to their arrest - or worse. Flooding the street in the name of \"The Lady\" may provide high quality images and a powerful message for global social media and TV news. But the grainy film of 1988 is a chilling reminder that these very roads were bathed in blood when soldiers cut down a previous generation who were asking for freedom. There's nothing new that I can see that suggests the Tatmadaw would stop short of carrying out a live-streamed massacre in the major cities of Myanmar. There is another paradox in the country's latest traumatic chapter. Aung San Suu Kyi's chances of finding freedom, and possibly even a return to power, are dependent on the action or inaction of the \"international community\". A simplistic label for a disparate grouping of friend and foe, East and West. As far as the privileged society that is the West is concerned, Suu Kyi was Life-President - a beacon of all the values elected leaders will tell you they hold dear. But it's a club she turned her back on following the avalanche of criticism she received for refusing to support or protect the Rohingya. She was seemingly unmoved as titles, awards, prizes were rescinded by horrified universities and charities. One illustration of the souring relationship was with my employer. The BBC World Service was a loyal companion for her during her more than 15 years of house arrest. But following the atrocities of 2017 in Rakhine State, it all changed. Like for other Western media outlets, my frequent letters of request for an interview or audience were not returned. There was apparently no need to engage those who, in her view, could never understand the complexities of her country. In my two years covering Myanmar, the closest I got to a conversation was at the International Court of Justice in The Hague after she chose to personally defend Myanmar's army from the charge of genocide. \"Will you ever say sorry, Ms Suu Kyi?\" I called out as she glided from her executive car into the cold arena where accounts of the worst imaginable crimes are considered. No answer. Not that I was expecting one. Aung San Suu Kyi decided to be the face of the effort to justify the crimes of Myanmar's unaccountable army. Despite the widespread loathing of the military, it boosted her popularity at home and she was praised for protecting the country's honour. But some now believe she should no longer be the ubiquitous face of the nascent struggle to free the country from newfound military dictatorship. \"The response to this situation should not be seen in narrow terms as 'Helping Aung San Suu Kyi',\" Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based political analyst, told me. \"It's about opposing a military coup against a popularly elected government and supporting the vast majority of ordinary Myanmar people and their democratic rights and freedoms.\" Others are more blunt. \"When I heard about the coup I thought she had been outsmarted after making a pact with the devil,\" said Bill Richardson, a former US Ambassador to the UN. He was a friend of Suu Kyi until the pair fell out in 2018 after he says he implored her, wholly unsuccessfully, to do more to protect the Rohingya. \"I was one of her biggest fans until she got elected,\" he said. Mr Richardson believes the National League for Democracy finally needs to develop new leaders, particularly women, especially at a time when their democratic mandate has been crushed. Aung San Suu Kyi faces trumped up charges which could see her jailed, which would bar her from office. The generals claim there will elections at some point once the country emerges from its designated \"state of emergency\". It's clear they want to puncture the tyres of this electoral juggernaut who would smash every army road block on the road to democracy if the rules of the game were fair. What will his former friend of 20 years be thinking now as she faces months, if not years under house arrest or worse, I ask Mr Richardson. \"I think she'll feel that she's been betrayed by the military she provided international cover for. Her position is bleak. But I hope they don't take steps to hurt her or silence her permanently.\" And if Aung San Suu Kyi is allowed a voice once again, what then? \"If she is able to speak out and acknowledges the crimes against the Rohingya people in a way that the international community would think is credible and honest, it's still not too late. That would rally the world into action against this coup,\" he said. \"It would be a risk. But she's taken risks before.\" Nick Beake is the BBC Brussels correspondent and was the BBC's Myanmar correspondent from 2018-2020.", "summary": "你如何形容缅甸的军方领导层？"}

But in 2014 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said its Antarctic hunt was not scientific and should cease. Activists say the programme is inhumane and unsustainable. Japan insists it is trying to prove the whale population is large enough to justify a return to whaling for commercial purposes, and says it has to kills the mammals to carry out its research. In the 2014/2015 season Japan said it would respect the ICJ's decision and did not catch any whales in the Antarctic, although it did go ahead with a smaller hunt in the Pacific. Japan's Fisheries Agency said on Monday that it has taken into account the ICJ's ruling and this year aims to catch only 333 Antarctic minke whales - about one-third of previous targets. Several nations, including Australia, which brought the ICJ case against Japan, have voiced their dismay at the resumption of the hunts, as have environmental activists. \"It's not scientific research, it's straight-up commercial whaling, and it's been declared illegal by the International Court of Justice,\" Nathaniel Pelle from Greenpeace Australia told the AFP news agency. An 8,000 tonne ship - the Nisshin Maru - and three smaller harpoon ships departed from Shimonoseki in south-western Japan. Tomoaki Nakao, the mayor of Shimonoseki, was wholeheartedly behind the resumption. \"There's nothing as happy as this day,\" he said at a ceremony for the fleet's crew before they set sail. The hunt itself will run from late December until March next year, according to Japan's Fisheries Agency. The decision to resume was announced just days before Tuesday's sailing. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) that regulates the industry, agreed a pause - commonly now known as the moratorium - on whaling, to begin from the 1985/6 season. Japan agreed to the moratorium but has since continued whaling under the scientific research exemption. Some other whaling nations, for example Norway, continue having simply lodged formal objections to the moratorium.

Although he mumbles the offending word, the presenter clearly begins by saying the letter \"n\". Responding to the row, the BBC issued a strongly-worded statement. \"Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. We have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the BBC expects on air and off. \"We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.\" Clarkson initially denied using the racist term, telling his 3.3 million Twitter followers: \"I did not use the N-word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time.\" But the newspaper responded by posting a clip of the incident - which was filmed in 2012 and never broadcast. On Thursday night, Clarkson released a video statement \"begging forgiveness\" for the error. This time, he admitted he had appeared to \"mumble\" the offensive word despite attempting not to. \"I was mortified by this, horrified. It was a word I loathe.\" \"I did everything in my power to ensure that that word did not get in the programme that was transmitted.\" Editor of The Voice newspaper George Ruddock said that, if it was clear Clarkson had used the offensive term, \"the BBC should take some action\". \"If you were in a normal workplace and that was used, it would certainly call for disciplinary action,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"How often is he going to keep apologising for these things?\" Labour MP Jim Sheridan, who sits on Parliament's culture, media and sport committee, also noted this was not Clarkson's first offence, and called for him to be sacked. He said: \"Already he's insulted nations, he's insulted disabled persons, he's insulted people with mental illness. Every time he apologises, and every time the BBC say that they've told him to cut it out, and he's not doing it.\" \"His whole career is littered with apologies, and I doubt very much if indeed he is sorry.\" Downing Street condemned any use of the word, saying that David Cameron - a friend of Clarkson's - would \"certainly not\" use it. The prime minister felt it was \"absolutely right that there has been an apology,\" his spokesman said. But he refused to comment on whether Clarkson should lose his job, saying: \"His view is that in terms of actions and the like, that's for the BBC\". Former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland also rebutted calls for Clarkson to be sacked, despite acknowledging \"a serious error of judgment\". \"He shouldn't be sacked. I tell you who should be sacked, and that's the person who released the clip to the Daily Mirror in order to give the whole thing a wider circulation than it deserved\". \"It's a word that wasn't broadcast. He's apologised and, really, that should be the end of the matter\". \"Do you think he's a racist? I suspect not. I think he's sloppy in his use of language.\" Production notes On Friday, Clarkson spoke to The Sun, where he writes a column, and attempted to explain the incident. \"I wish to God my attempts to cover up that word were better,\" he said. \"I was simply mumbling - saying 'ner ner' or something similar. Anything but the n-word. \"It was my mistake and I apologise for not covering it up. But if you look closely at the footage, you can see what I'm trying to do.\" He also showed the newspaper production notes for the Top Gear episode, in which he attempted to have the offensive word removed. The 54-year-old told producers: \"I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. \"Is there another take?\" Although the clip was never broadcast on the BBC Two show, the corporation said it had received more than 300 complaints following recent media coverage. Previous incidents It is not the first time the Top Gear presenter has been accused of racism. The BBC apologised in 2011, after an episode in which co-presenter Richard Hammond called Mexicans \"feckless [and] flatulent\" and Clarkson joked they would not receive complaints because the Mexican ambassador would be asleep. Apologies were also made for an episode broadcast in March, in which Clarkson used the word \"slope\" as an Asian man crossed a newly built bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. The use of the word - which is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - led to complaints and the threat of legal action from Equal Justice, a law firm specialising in discrimination cases.", "summary": "英国广播公司BBC汽车节目Top Gear主持人之一杰罗米·克拉克森（Jeremy Clarkson）否认自己在其中一集节目中使用了种族歧视的字眼。"}

Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on 18 September to decide on their country's future. They will be asked the \"Yes/No\" question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" In her statement, Ms Rowling, who was born in south Gloucestershire, said she had friends on both sides of the debate, adding that the \"Yes\" campaign's \"romantic outlook strikes a chord with me\". But she added: \"My hesitance at embracing independence has nothing to do with lack of belief in Scotland's remarkable people or its achievements. \"The simple truth is that Scotland is subject to the same 21st century pressures as the rest of the world. \"It must compete in the same global markets, defend itself from the same threats and navigate what still feels like a fragile economic recovery. \"The more I listen to the 'Yes' campaign, the more I worry about its minimisation and even denial of risks.

Ms Rowling also said: \"I also know that there is a fringe of nationalists who like to demonise anyone who is not blindly and unquestionably pro-independence and I suspect, notwithstanding the fact that I've lived in Scotland for 21 years and plan to remain here for the rest of my life, that they might judge me 'insufficiently Scottish' to have a valid view.\" Shortly after the author's blog went live, social media was awash with comments. Edinburgh-based charity, Dignity Project, tweeted: \"What a #bitch after we gave her shelter in our city when she was a single mum.\" That remark was condemned by both sides of the debate. Pro-independence supporter Patrick Harvie MSP responded on Twitter: \"A comment like that is a disgrace to the Yes cause, and to the cause of social justice.\" The charity later claimed its account had been hacked. Individual donors According to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, Ms Rowling is estimated to be worth £570m. Both sides of the independence campaign have now received a number of big individual donations. Recent Electoral Commission figures showed that Ayrshire Lottery winners Colin and Chris Weir donated £1m to the SNP earlier this year, taking their total donations to the pro-independence cause to £5.5m. The couple, who have said they are \"lifelong supporters of independence\", added that the donations had led to them being subjected to \"downright nasty\" personal attacks. They won £161m on EuroMillions in 2011 and have also set up a charitable trust to fund good causes. Four facts on JK Rowling Following news of the donation, First Minister Alex Salmond told the BBC: \"JK Rowling's entitled to give money to whatever she pleases and is entitled to express her views. \"When it comes to people in the artistic community, I think the general feeling would be that the substantial majority of them are backing the 'Yes' cause. \"We're now in a period of spending limits and both campaigns are rightly regulated on how much they can spend - I think that's a good thing, because that makes sure we're going to have an equal fight in terms of finance, and it will be then up to the people to decide and make their judgement.\" 'No thanks' Speaking on behalf of the Better Together campaign, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said Ms Rowling's donation would be put to \"good use\". She added: \"This is a significant and welcome intervention from one of this country's most talented and successful women. Separation is failing to win support among women and more and more of us are saying No Thanks to Alex Salmond's plan. \"It doesn't take a wizard to work out that Alex Salmond's case for breaking up the UK simply isn't a risk worth taking. The best way to make sure that we can make our country fairer is by working together across the whole of the UK, not putting a barrier between us.\"", "summary": "英国畅销作家、《哈利·波特》的作者J.K.罗琳（J.K.

He at one time topped the list of most wanted Nazi war crimes suspects and is alleged to have helped deport 15,700 Jews to death camps in World War II. He faced charges relating to his wartime activities in both Hungary and in neighbouring Slovakia. Mr Horvath said his client died on Saturday morning. \"He had been treated for medical issues for some time but contracted pneumonia, from which he died.\" Csatary had denied the allegations against him, saying he was merely an intermediary between Hungarian and German officials and was not involved in war crimes. Art dealer He was charged in June by Hungarian prosecutors in relation to what they said had been his role as chief of an internment camp for Jews in Kosice, a town then part of Hungary but now in Slovakia. Kosice, known at the time as Kassa, was the first camp to be established after Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944. Prosecutors said in a statement that Csatary, a Hungarian police officer at the time, had \"deliberately provided help to the unlawful executions and torture committed against Jews deported to concentration camps... from Kosice\". He was accused of regularly beating prisoners with his bare hands and a dog whip. Csatary, whose full name is Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary, was sentenced to death in his absence in Czechoslovakia in 1948 for war crimes. Slovakia was seeking his extradition from Hungary so it could formally sentence him although, with the abolition of the death penalty, it intended to imprison him. The legal proceedings in Hungary were halted last month on the grounds of double jeopardy. Csatary was named in 2012 by the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center as its most wanted suspect. It claimed he oversaw the deportations of Jews from Kosice to the Auschwitz death camp. He was tracked down in Budapest in July 2012 by reporters from the UK's Sun newspaper, with help from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and was put under house arrest. He had fled to Canada after the war, where he worked as an art dealer in Montreal and Toronto, and disappeared in 1997 after being stripped of his Canadian citizenship. The US-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the news of his death. \"It is a shame that Csatary, a convicted... and totally unrepentant Holocaust perpetrator who was finally indicted in his homeland for his crimes, ultimately eluded justice and punishment at the very last minute,'' Efraim Zuroff, the centre's director, said in a statement. The Simon Wiesenthal Center last month launched its Operation Last Chance II project, offering rewards for information that could help it track down the last surviving Nazi war criminals and bring them to justice. Among its most wanted is Alois Brunner, a key operative of Adolf Eichmann, who was last seen in Syria in 2001, and Aribert Heim, a doctor at three concentration camps, who disappeared in 1962 and was last seen in Egypt in 1992.", "summary": "98岁的匈牙利纳粹犯罪嫌疑人拉斯洛·乔塔里在等待审判期间死去。"}

He had been found guilty of killing 56-year-old Isadore Rozeman, a jeweller for whom Mr Ford occasionally worked. US media reports say that he is one of the longest-serving death row inmates in modern US history to be exonerated. Mr Ford had always denied killing Mr Rozeman. 'Very pleased' Asked by a reporter how he was feeling as he left the high security prison in Angola, Louisiana, Mr Ford said: \"My mind is going in all kinds of directions but it feels good.\" He said that he did harbour some resentment because he had been locked up for almost 30 years \"for something I didn't do\" and had lost years of his life. \"Thirty years, 30 years of my life if not all of it. I can't go back and do anything that I should've been doing when I was 35, 38 and 40 - stuff like that. My son when I left was a baby, now they're grown men with babies.\" State District Judge Ramona Emanuel on Monday overturned Mr Ford's conviction and sentence because of new information that supported his claim that he was not present or involved in Mr Rozeman's death, Mr Ford's lawyers said. He was convicted over the 1983 killing and sentenced to death. \"We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr Ford free,\" a statement by the freed man's lawyers said.

It says the latest virus exploits a flaw in Microsoft Windows identified by, and stolen from, US intelligence. There are fears of more \"ransomware\" attacks as people begin work on Monday, although few have been reported so far. Live reports: Ransomware cyber-attack fallout Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Many firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users' files and demanded $300 (£230) payments to restore access. The spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have said. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far. Read more: BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggests about $38,000 (£29,400) had been paid by Monday morning. However, the ransomware warning said that the cost would double after three days, so the payments may increase. It threatens to delete files within seven days if no payment is made. The effect in Asian nations so far on Monday has been limited. South Korea said just nine cases of ransomware had been found, giving no further details. Australian officials said so far only three small-to-medium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems while New Zealand's ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated. In Japan, both Nissan and Hitachi reported some units had been affected, while in China energy giant PetroChina said that at some petrol stations customers had been unable to use its payment system. 'Like stealing Tomahawks' A statement from Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems. \"We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,\" he wrote. \"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.\" He added: \"The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.\" The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread. Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it. \"As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,\" Mr Smith said. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter There are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn't do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft. The NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed. But then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems. Updating your computer if you're an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain's National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex. For a company like Microsoft to say it won't keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom. Meanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC the ransomware was designed to allow \"infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks\", adding: \"That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.\" Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said. A UK security researcher known as \"MalwareTech\", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted \"another one coming... quite likely on Monday\". MalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an \"accidental hero\" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it. Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or \"copy-cat authors\" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against. \"Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,\" she said. In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected. Other organisations targeted worldwide included Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's Interior Ministry.

In his victory speech, he said that he wanted to \"go down in history as a good president\". We look at the five most pressing issues facing the man who will take over as president on 1 December. 1. Corruption Corruption is an overwhelming and widespread problem in Mexico. According to a 2017 report by anti-corruption pressure group Transparency International, 51% of Mexicans surveyed said they had had to pay a bribe to access public services, the highest rate in Latin America. At least 14 former or current governors are currently under investigation for corruption. While corruption at the highest levels of government is not a recent development in Mexico, revelations that the most vulnerable were defrauded by those in power did stir levels of public anger not seen before. In Veracruz, the administration of then-governor Javier Duarte was accused of purchasing fake medicines, leading to children with cancer being given water instead of chemotherapy. Outgoing President Enrique Peña Nieto himself did not escape criticism after his wife bought a house worth $7m (£5.3m) from a government contractor. Mr López Obrador tapped into public anger about corruption, promising to eradicate it, a promise he repeated in his victory speech. \"Corruption is not a cultural phenomenon, it's the result of a regime in decline,\" he said. He also said that no-one who was guilty of corruption would be spared, \"even brothers-in-arms\". One of the concrete proposals he has put forward is to revise oil contracts awarded by the current administration to companies to check them for signs of corruption. Any contracts showing signs of anomalies will be addressed by Congress, he has said. 2. Security and impunity As well as corruption, Amlo mentioned impunity as one of his twin priorities. Levels of violence reached a record high in Mexico in 2017, with more than 25,000 people killed. But what many Mexicans voters complained about more than the number of killings was the fact that so many crimes go unpunished. The election campaign also saw an unprecedented number of politicians being killed, more than 130 since the registration process started in September, 48 of which were running for office in this election. Many were running in areas where drug gangs wield a lot of influence leading residents to ask if those running for office could be taken out how they could be protected. In his victory speech, Mr López Obrador blamed corruption for the violence in Mexico. However, except for his plan to meet daily at 06:00 with his public security cabinet, which he said would be put under a \"unified command\", he has given little detail about how he aims to tackle the endemic violence in Mexico. His predecessors in office declared a \"war on drugs\" which drove the number of murders even higher as drug cartels splintered and fought for control of disputed areas. Under President Enrique Peña Nieto, high-profile cartel bosses were arrested but the vacuum left again seemed to inflame turf wars. Amlo has said he will take a softer approach, saying that under his administration there would be \"abrazos, no balazos\" (hugs, not shoot-outs). However, when he mooted an amnesty for those involved in the drugs trade, it was met by widespread outrage and aides later said it would be restricted to farmers growing illicit crops. 3. Poverty and inequality Amlo and his advisers have argued that one of the main factors behind Mexico's high levels of violence is extreme poverty. He argues that unless young people have choices, they will be lured into illegality by criminal gangs. In order to prevent them from joining gangs, he has proposed offering scholarships and jobs to young people. Critics, however, have questioned how successful such a scheme could be when drug gangs offer fast money. He has also said he will help the elderly by doubling their pensions \"from my first day in office\". And in his victory speech, he also said he would work for \"all Mexicans\" giving special emphasis to helping indigenous people, who are among the poorest in Mexico. 4. Improving US relations Mr López Obrador was scathing in his criticism of US President Donald Trump during his campaign, something that analysts say won him extra votes from Mexicans angry at the insults Mr Trump had aimed at Mexicans. He said he would make Mr Trump \"see reason\" and \"put him in his place\". But now that he has been elected, Mr López Obrador has struck a much more conciliatory note, saying he would pursue a relationship of friendship and cooperation\" with the US. Not only are the US a key trading partner for Mexico, US law enforcement agencies also cooperate closely with Mexican forces combating crime and drugs trafficking. And while President Trump has slammed Mexico for allegedly not doing enough to stop Central American migrants from crossing over to the US, the two countries have been working together. Along with Canada, they are also in the - currently deadlocked - talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). A tweet by President Trump congratulating Mr López Obrador suggests that former is also keen to start on a friendly footing after months of acrimony. With a massive 81% of Mexican exports going to the United States in 2017, the two countries have a vested interest in making their relationship work. 5. Kickstarting the economy Mexico's economy is the second-largest in Latin America but it has been a lot more sluggish than Mexican and investors had hoped for, and they are looking to Amlo to change that. In his victory speech, Mr López Obrador said his government would be fiscally disciplined and would not raise taxes. But critics have wondered from where he will source the money for the social programmes he has promised to deliver. Amlo has said that a crackdown on corruption will mean that his administration will have more money at its disposal as it will stop millions of pesos being embezzled.", "summary": "年过花甲的长期左翼斗士，原墨西哥城市长奥夫拉多尔（Andrés Manuel López Obrador），历经十数载参选屡败屡战，终于在刚刚结束的墨西哥大选中修成正果，以超过53%的压倒优势胜出。他在支持者们欢呼雀跃中成为这个美国南邻数十年来第一位左翼总统。"}

It alleges that Facebook systematically intercepts messages to mine user data and profits by sharing it with data aggregators, advertisers and marketers.

The lawsuit is claiming the greater of either $100 (£61) a day for each day of alleged violations or $10,000, for each user. 'Profitable opportunity' The lawsuit, filed earlier this week, cites independent research that, it claims, found Facebook reviews the contents of its users' private messages \"for purposes unrelated to the facilitation of message transmission\". \"Representing to users that the content of Facebook messages is \"private\" creates an especially profitable opportunity for Facebook,\" it says. It says this is \"because users who believe they are communicating on a service free from surveillance are likely to reveal facts about themselves that they would not reveal had they known the content was being monitored. \"Thus, Facebook has positioned itself to acquire pieces of the users' profiles that are likely unavailable to other data aggregators.\" However, others have come forward to defend Facebook. Writing on his blog, security expert Graham Cluley said that if the site was not examining links shared privately, Facebook would be failing a \"duty of care\" to its users. \"If you didn't properly scan and check links there's a very real risk that spam, scams, phishing attacks, and malicious URLs designed to infect recipients' computers with malware could run rife,\" he argued. Criticism Facebook has come under attack over its privacy policies in the past. In September last year, it faced criticism over a proposed change to its privacy policy which would have allowed ads to be created using the names and profile pictures of Facebook users. The firm had claimed that its proposal merely clarified the language of its privacy policy, rather than making any material changes to it. Facebook undertook to change the wording in the wake of a legal action launched in 2011 which saw it pay $20m to compensate users who claimed it had used their data without explicit permission.", "summary": "知名社交网站“脸书”（Facebook）因被指扫描用户的私人信息而遭到用户集体诉讼。"}

The US insists this agreement must be in place before it commits to leaving some troops behind for counter-insurgent operations and training. The US has had troops in Afghanistan since 2001 when it toppled the Taliban. Its forces went into the country following the 9/11 attacks on the US. With Afghan and Western allies, they quickly overthrew the Taliban authorities, but have faced insurgent attacks since then. Correspondents say the disagreement over the bilateral security agreement (BSA) is the latest step in the long and deteriorating relationship between Washington and Mr Karzai, who was once seen as a key US ally. The BSA, which offers legal protection for US troops and defines a post-2014 Nato training and anti-insurgent mission, was agreed by the two countries last year after months of negotiation. It was endorsed at a national gathering (Loya Jirga) of Afghan elders in Kabul in November. 'Contingency planning' But Mr Karzai has refused to sign the deal until a peace process is under way with the Taliban, adding that if he were to sign it, he would become responsible if Afghans were killed by US bombs. \"President Obama told President Karzai that because he has demonstrated that it is unlikely that he will sign the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement), the United States is moving forward with additional contingency planning,\" the White House said in a statement. \"Specifically, President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014. \"Furthermore, the longer we go without a BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 US mission will be smaller in scale and ambition.\" While Mr Karzai has refused to sign the BSA, some candidates in April's Afghan presidential elections have indicated they would. Mr Karzai, who has served two terms as Afghanistan's first and only president since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, is obliged by law to stand down after the next election. Analysts say the US statement clearly implies that Mr Karzai's stance will harm his country's security long after he leaves office. The White House statement came as US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel flew to Brussels for a Nato meeting at which Afghanistan is due to be discussed.", "summary": "美国总统奥巴马电话警告阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊说，美军可能在2014年底前全部撤出阿富汗。"}

He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci had earlier warned that the virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was \"entirely conceivable\" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. What did Trump say? Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures \"the way you win\", adding that the US \"will be well on our way to recovery\" by June. Suggesting that the \"peak\" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that \"nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all\". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the \"death rate\", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that \"2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this\", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 \"we all together have done a very good job\". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a \"beautiful time\" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was \"just an aspiration\". \"I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know.\" He said that \"rapid testing\" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a \"ratings hit\". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures \"don't matter to me\". \"What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible\" he said. What's the situation in the US? Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (£200-£400). In California, a \"shelter in place\" order remains. What about the shortage of equipment? Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of \"hoarding\" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. \"We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,\" he said. Hospitals \"can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road\", he said, alleging that some were \"stocked up\". The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. What's the global picture?

The musician shared an image of the window of her car spattered with egg, and thanking two motorcyclists she said rescued her. Windows smashed Uber officials have insisted they will continue their activities until France's highest court rules on the service - an attitude Mr Cazeneuve called \"cynical and arrogant\". Key highways around Paris were blocked and tyres were burned during the day-long strike. Barriers also appeared around Marseille and Aix-en-Provence in southeast France. Some cars were overturned and others had their windows smashed with bats. Aeroports de Paris, the operator of the French capital's Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly airports, warned passengers to travel by train, saying \"access by road is completely blocked\". Some travellers walked along the side of the motorway to reach the airport. Taxi drivers also blocked access to Marseille and Aix train stations and protested on the main access to Marseilles-Provence airport. France's taxi drivers - who have to pay thousands of euros for a licence - say they are being unfairly undercut by UberPOP. \"Many taxis drivers are infuriated,\" Abdelkader Morghad, a representative of the FTI taxi union, told Bloomberg. He said a law that forbids unlicensed drivers to carry paying passengers should be implemented. France's licensed drivers have lost between 30% and 40% of their income over two years because of the growth of UberPOP, Mr Morghad said. UberPOP is a car-sharing service offered by Uber, which brings together customers and private drivers at prices lower than those charged by both traditional taxi firms and even other Uber services. UberPOP differs because it allows non-professional drivers to register their car and transport other passengers. It has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and the service continues to operate, AFP news agency reports. Mr Cazeneuve said on Thursday that he had ordered police in Paris to issue a decree banning UberPOP and said any cars defying the order would be seized. Uber spokesman Thomas Meister said the firm had contested the law under which UberPOP has been ruled illegal, and accused the interior minister of overriding the normal legal process. \"The way things work in a state of law is that it's for the justice to judge whether something is legal or illegal,\" he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. San Francisco-based Uber says it has a million users in France, including 250,000 for UberPOP. Uber also operates a luxury service which is not banned. Uber has faced similar teething problems in cities all over the world, with traditional taxi drivers protesting against being undercut by the unlicensed company.

The surrender of one unit of 60 soldiers, who had taken control of one of the Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul, was shown live on TV on Saturday morning. Istanbul's main Ataturk airport is now under army control, and flights - which had been interrupted for some hours - were due to resume from 06:00 (03:00 GMT). In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said the coup attempt \"was foiled by the Turkish people in unity and solidarity. Our president and government are in charge\". \"Turkish Armed Forces was not involved in the coup attempt in its entirety. It was conducted by a clique within the armed forces and received a well-deserved response from our nation.\" It is unclear who is leading the coup faction or how much support it enjoys. The group earlier declared that a \"peace council\" now ran the country and there was a curfew and martial law. Soldiers were seen at strategic points in Istanbul, with jets flying low in Ankara. Two large explosion were also heard near Istanbul's central Taksim Square. There were also reports of blasts at parliament building in Ankara. MPs were believed to be hiding in shelters. Broadcaster CNN Turk was reportedly taken over by soldiers, and its live broadcast was cut. In Washington, US President Barack Obama urged all parties in Turkey to support the \"democratically elected government\". Nato called for \"full respect\" for Turkey's democratic institutions. European Council President Donald Tusk said the country was \"a key partner for the European Union\". \"We call for a swift return to Turkey's constitutional order,\" he added. 'Parallel structure' Speaking in Istanbul in the early hours on Saturday, President Erdogan promised to clean up the army. \"Those who drive around in tanks will have to go back to where they came from,\" he said. He also dismissed the coup leaders as \"terrorists\". Mr Erdogan earlier told CNN Turk by mobile phone the action was by a \"parallel structure\" that would bring the necessary response. He has used this term in the past to refer to Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Muslim cleric he accuses of fomenting unrest. Fethullah Gulen: Powerful but reclusive Turkish cleric However, in a statement, Mr Gulen rejected any suggestion he had links to the events. \"I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,\" he said. Mr Erdogan had called on people to take to the streets to oppose the uprising. He said: \"I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports. I never believed in a power higher than the power of the people.\" The president said he had returned to Istanbul from the holiday resort of Marmaris in the south-west of the country. He said the town was later bombed. Defying the announced curfew, a number of Erdogan supporters turned out on Taksim Square in Istanbul late on Friday. There were reports of clashes there, with some on Twitter saying that gunfire had been heard near the square. After the military takeover was announced, a statement from the group was read out on national broadcaster TRT. It said that the democratic and secular rule of law had been eroded by the current government. There would be new constitution, it said. Mr Yildirim told NTV by telephone: \"There was an illegal act by a group within the military that was acting out of the chain of military command. Our people should know that we will not allow any activity that would harm democracy.\" Traffic was stopped from crossing both the Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges in Istanbul.

He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Inexhaustible Churchill quotes Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. A writer's flair He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Solidly conservative rulings Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case. Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about \"executive overreach\", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock. He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state. In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that \"executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\". In a 2013 case, he upheld a lower court's ruling that a police officer was protected under qualified-immunity law after he used a stun gun on a 22-year-old student, who died from the incident.", "summary": "美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）提名的最高法院大法官尼尔·戈萨奇（Judge Neil Gorsuch），是近四分之一世纪以来的提名者当中最年轻的一个。"}

A group of Chinese activists and writers also signed a letter urging Liu's release from inciting subversion. Meanwhile, Liu's wife has given her first interview since she was placed under house arrest two years ago. Activist Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 despite the Chinese government's fierce opposition. He was sentenced in 2009 for helping to draft a manifesto - Charter '08 - calling for political change. He is serving 11 years in jail for inciting the subversion of state power. His wife, Liu Xia, told the Associated Press news agency her house arrest had been a painful experience. \"I felt I was a person emotionally prepared to respond to the consequences of Liu Xiaobo winning the [Nobel] prize. But after he won the prize, I really never imagined that after he won, I would not be able to leave my home,\" she said. Her Beijing apartment has no internet or phone access. She is allowed out twice a week to buy groceries and visit her parents, and can see her husband once a month, she says. \"I think Kafka could not have written anything more absurd and unbelievable than this,\" she said. 'Ending political imprisonment' The letters come four years after the Charter '08 manifesto and Liu's subsequent jailing. The Nobel laureates, who include the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, South African Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and US writer Toni Morrison, made public the letter to Mr Xi on Tuesday. \"As you have taken the first step towards assuming the presidency of the People's Republic of China, we write to welcome the prospect of fresh leadership and new ideas,\" they wrote. \"To that end, we respectfully urge you to release Dr Liu Xiaobo, the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and his wife, Liu Xia.\" Mr Xi, China's leader in waiting, was made Communist Party leader during its once-in-a-decade power transition last month. The Chinese writers, rights activists and lawyers also sent a letter echoing the laureates' sentiment, calling Liu's prison term \"a brazen violation of citizens' basic rights\". \"We believe that the existence of political prisoners does not help China to build its image of a responsible world power,\" they said. \"Ending political imprisonment is an important benchmark for China to move toward a civilised political system.\" At least 40 signed the letter when it was released on Tuesday, with the number reaching close to 300 on Thursday. Among those who signed the letter were legal scholar He Weifang, human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and AIDS activist Hu Jia. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, responded to the letter sent by the Nobel laureates on Wednesday. \"China is a law-abiding country. Liu Xiaobo was lawfully sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment by the judicial organ because he committed an offence against Chinese law,\" he said. \"The Chinese government opposes outsiders handling matters in any way that would interfere in its judicial sovereignty and internal matters.\" On the other hand, he congratulated Mo Yan, who he said \"loves his country and people\". The letters come as Chinese writer Mo Yan prepares to receive his Nobel Prize for Literature in Sweden on Monday. While he has been criticised for not speaking out much on rights issues in China, he has previously called out for Liu Xiaobo to be freed \"as soon as possible\".", "summary": "世界各国134位诺贝尔奖得主联名致信中共最高领导人习近平，敦促中国释放世界上唯一受监禁的诺贝尔和平奖得主刘晓波并解除对刘晓波妻子刘霞的软禁。"}

Many of the migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat in recent months. 'Work together' The plan to use quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy among several EU countries, including France and Spain. Ms Greening told the BBC: \"We don't accept having mandatory quotas or mandatory resettlement programmes. \"Our concern is that approach simply ends up acting as a pull for more migrants to make, what for many of them is a life and death decision to get on a boat that may not be sea worthy and over the past year 5,000 migrants have died at sea.\" She said looking at why people were making the journeys was key. \"If you look at what is driving people to start these journeys in the first place, it's the hope of a better life,\" she said. \"And that's why the only real answer in the long term is to work together, as the international community, to tackle what is an international problem and to work together to deliver development and to level up the world so that we don't leave anyone behind, or leave anyone living in poverty in the future, as is happened in the past.\" The issue was catapulted to the top of the EU agenda after hundreds of people were believed to have drowned when a boat carrying up to 700 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea in April.

Swedish prosecutor Ingrid Isgren listened as an Ecuadorean prosecutor put the questions to Mr Assange. He took refuge in the embassy four years ago, fearing extradition. He says the sex was consensual and believes the allegations are politically motivated. The accusations relate to a visit Mr Assange made to Stockholm in August 2010 to give a lecture. Ms Isgren and Swedish police inspector Cecilia Redell left the embassy at 13:30 local time (13:30 GMT) without making any statement to the media. They may continue questioning Mr Assange for several days. Q&A: Julian Assange and the law Mr Assange has refused to travel to Sweden for questioning citing concerns he would be extradited to the US over Wikileaks' release of 500,000 secret military files on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. However, lawyers argue that his extradition from Sweden would be even less likely than from the UK. Mr Assange is accused of raping a woman, named in legal papers as SW, at her home in August 2010. Swedish prosecutors dropped part of their investigation last year because of a statute of limitations. Mr Assange is \"not hiding\" at the embassy, but he will not go to Sweden because he would thereby risk losing his Ecuadorean asylum status, his lawyer Jennifer Robinson told the BBC on Monday. \"Sweden refused to provide assurances against onward extradition to the United States,\" she said, accusing the Swedish authorities of \"dragging their feet\" over the case. Deadlock broken - by Caroline Hawley, BBC News It's taken many months of tortuous diplomatic and legal exchanges just to get the Swedish prosecutor in the door. Under the agreement worked out with Ecuador, the Swedes were not allowed to question Julian Assange directly. Instead questions were to be submitted in Spanish and put to the Wikileaks founder by an Ecuadorean prosecutor. No follow-up questions were allowed. This may explain why the Swedish prosecutor had been reluctant to question Julian Assange in London, insisting it would \"lower the quality of the interview\". She changed her mind in March 2015, a few months before lesser allegations made against Julian Assange had to be dropped because of a time limitation. At the embassy Mr Assange is beyond the reach of the UK authorities. Sweden has issued an arrest warrant for him, which he has appealed against. Shortly after Ms Isgren entered the embassy, a cat - said to belong to Mr Assange - appeared at one of the windows and began watching the journalists and Assange supporters gathered outside. The cat has its own Twitter feed, which says it lives with Mr Assange and is \"interested in counter-purrveillance\". Confidentiality A statement on behalf of the Swedish prosecutors, quoted by the Press Association, said the investigation would remain confidential. \"Therefore, the prosecutors cannot provide information concerning details of the investigation after the interview,\" it said. One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Per Samuelson, said his client \"is very happy that he finally will be given the opportunity to give his statement to the Swedish prosecution. \"He has been waiting for this for over six years. He has prepared himself very carefully and will give a statement and will co-operate to the full extent.\"", "summary": "瑞典检察官周五（13日），表示将亲赴伦敦厄瓜多尔大使馆询问“维基解密”创始人阿桑奇（Julian Assange）。"}

One of them, Zaman, once one of Turkey's biggest newspapers, was put under state control in March. Arrest warrants have been issued for 47 staff. Many of the media outlets are linked to the US-based cleric Fetullah Gulen The government says Mr Gulen was behind the army-led attempted coup, a claim he denies. Separately, the government announced on Wednesday that nearly 1,700 members of the armed forces, including 149 generals and admirals had been discharged. At least 246 people died during the coup, and more than 2,000 people were injured. Both the closure of the media outlets and the soldiers' dismissal were announced in Turkey's official Resmi Gazete. While most are relatively small provincial outlets, several with a national audience have also been targeted. Zaman's readers were mostly Gulen supporters, who stopped reading it after the state takeover in March, rendering it unprofitable. In addition to the warrants issued for the 47 Zaman staff, authorities had sought the arrest of 42 other journalists earlier in the week. Some of the media outlets closed A purge too far? Analysis from Mark Lowen, BBC News, Istanbul The numbers are staggering: 131 media outlets - newspapers, TV channels, radio stations, magazines, news agencies and publishing houses - will be closed, accused of spreading the ideology of Fethullah Gulen or backing the failed coup. A legitimate clampdown - or a purge too far? The debate rages. It has long been known that the exiled cleric has controlled or been close to a wide array of media organisations. Months ago, the main Gulenist press organs - Zaman and Cihan news agency - were taken over, amidst a chorus of dissent. Turkey's ranking in the press-freedom index of Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog, was relegated to 151st. After the attempted coup, the government feels vindicated in its suspicions - and the state of emergency has given it the power to act. But the accusations are growing that it is not just Gulenists but also critical journalists with no proven links to the movement who are being targeted. Among those discharged from the armed forces are 87 army generals, 30 air force generals and 32 admirals. The Turkish army also revealed that 8,651 members, or 1.5%, of the nation's armed forces had taken part in the failed coup. President Erdogan has vowed to purge state bodies of the \"virus\" he says caused the revolt. Last week, Turkey declared a three-month state of emergency, allowing the president and the government to bypass parliament when drafting new laws and to restrict or suspend rights and freedoms.", "summary": "土耳其7月15日政变流产后，当局继续进行镇压，关闭了数十家媒体机构。"}

Located in an industrial area built on one of the rolling green hills surrounding the city, it was set up in line with the Rwandan government's strategy of boosting the country's clothing manufacturing sector. \"We've trained 130 youngsters, of whom 97% are female, since the factory launched,\" says the firm's director general and co-founder Jerome Mugabo. Behind him on the main factory floor, employees, who all seem to be in their teens or 20s, are producing chino trousers. Rwanda's efforts to boost its domestic garment industry have seen it fight a lonely, and continuing, trade battle with the US that dates back to 2015. Back then the six members of the East Africa Community (EAC) block of countries - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South-Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda - announced that they would all put in place high tariffs on the import of second-hand clothing or \"chagua\". The idea behind the de-facto ban was to stop the importation of large quantities of cheap used clothing, mostly from the US and the UK, which the African nations said were stifling the growth of their nascent garment industries. The extent of the issue for the six countries was shown by widely reported 2015 figures from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The USAID said that in that year, the EAC states accounted for almost 13% ($274m; £213m) of the global imports of used clothing. The study also found that almost two thirds of the combined populations purchased some second-hand clothes. Keen to hang on to its share of these exports, the US responded that the proposed ban would violate free-trade agreements, and it threatened to remove the EAC countries from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). Enacted back in 2000, this allows 39 sub-Saharan African nations to export thousands of goods duty-free to the US. After the US's announcement, all EAC members except for Rwanda backed out. It went on to introduce a tariff of $4 per kilogram on imports of used clothing in 2018. The US responded by putting tariffs of 30% on Rwandan clothing, where there had previously been none. While Rwanda was only exporting about $1.5m of clothing per year to the US at the time, this stopped that overnight, and meant that the African nation could not hope to increase it. However, Jerome Mugabo say he remains pleased by Rwanda's decision to go it alone. \"It helped us to set up our business, as we get more customers since the ban,\" he says. Ritesh Patel, managing director of Rwanda's oldest garment factory - Utexrwa, which was founded in 1984 - agrees. \"Rwanda needs to do this to be able to grow its economy,\" he says. \"As people were able to buy a second-hand men's shirt for 800 Rwandan francs [84 US cents; 64p], they were not interested in a new men's shirts of 4,000 Rwandan francs that we could produce.\" For years Utexrwa had focused solely on the production of uniforms, for the police, companies and schools. But since the ban on second-hand clothing imports, it has expanded into ordinary clothes, like men's shirts. \"It really helps that we no longer have to compete with cheap chagua, while we simultaneously witness a quickly growing middle class that will be able to afford \"Made in Rwanda\" products,\" adds Mr Patel. Yet where there are winners, there are also losers. \"Life has become very difficult,\" says Rajabu Nzeyimana, who stands behind a wooden market table piled high with second-hand boxer shorts, and a basket full of second-hand socks. The 42-year old father has sold used clothing for seven years, but since 2018 has been forced to start buying it at a much higher price from traders who smuggle it from the Congolese border town Goma into Rwanda. \"My sales plumped because I had to increase my prices fivefold to be able to make a living,\" he says. Mr Nzeyimana adds that he now struggles to pay his children's school fees. The withdrawal of the Agoa trade benefits for apparel also makes Rwanda less attractive as a manufacturing base for international garment producers. Chinese firm C&H Garment closed its factory in Kigali a few months after the US retaliated. It had exported more than half of its production to the US. Another Chinese clothing firm with an operation in Rwanda - Hong Kong's C&D Products - agrees that the stand off with the US is an issue. \"It is obviously a problem,\" says Maryse Mbonyumutwa, co-owner of its Rwandan subsidiary. Such Chinese firms are increasingly interested in opening factories in Africa, as the labour costs are much lower than in China. What C&D is now doing is exporting to Europe from its Rwandan factory, while planning to build two manufacturing sites in Tanzania to focus on the US market. To help the country's clothing manufacturers, the Rwandan government has removed import taxes on raw materials such as cotton. And new factories get grants and loans. Some experts, however, doubt if Rwanda will be able to build a competitive clothing industry. While Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Burundi are major cotton producing countries, Rwanda needs to import this raw material, as the tiny state isn't suitable for major cotton production, being a mountainous and extremely densely populated country. Water and electricity are also costly, and road transport is extremely bureaucratic and expensive as Rwanda is a landlocked country. The ban on used clothes also seems to have a totally different - unintended - effect as it pushes Rwandans to start buying cheap, imported new Chinese clothes. \"The government should have waited until the country had build a mature textile industry before banning chagua,\" says clothes seller Felicien Maniraguha. He has switched from selling imported used clothes to imported new Chinese ones. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Maniraguha says that local clothing production is still on too small a scale, and that the garments are not fashionable enough. \"Local garment factories currently only ensemble boring clothes that look like uniforms,\" says the 30-year-old. He contrasts this with the fashionable Chinese-made jeans and floral pint T-shirts that he is currently selling. \"Rwandans prefer clothes that look modern,\" he says. \"I doubt if the local textile industry will ever be able to produce nice, fashionable clothes that will become more popular than cheap Chinese imports.\"", "summary": "在东非国家卢旺达首都基加利（Kigali）郊区，一家工厂的100多台缝纫机正嘎嘎作响。"}

But curator Vyki Sparkes says the fatberg caused a \"marked increase\" in visitors to the museum and they are now thinking of preserving it, when it finishes its public display this week. There has been an \"incredible reaction\" from visitors, she says. It has become one the museum's most popular exhibits, says the curator. The piece of fatberg was taken from a \"monster fatberg\", over 250m (820ft) long and weighing 130 tonnes, which had become something of a sewer celebrity, when it was found under the streets of Whitechapel. Fatbergs are an accumulation of materials flushed into the sewers that form huge solid blocks - with the Whitechapel fatberg taking nine weeks to break up with drills. Fascinating fatberg In the first such exhibition of its kind, the Museum of London put this slice of urban history on public view in February, as an example of the challenges of getting rid of waste in the capital. The display ends at the weekend, but Ms Sparkes says they have been taken aback by its appeal, with people making special trips to see the fatberg and boosting visitor numbers. There has been a mixture of fascination and revulsion, she says, not least to see how the item has changed, under its glass case. \"We've never worked on anything like it,\" she says. There is an element of \"mystery\" about it, says the curator. \"It's under our feet, it grows. We're all responsible for creating it.\" The museum is now considering whether to keep it in its archive, rather than throwing it away. The rest of the monster fatberg has already been chopped up and converted into bio-diesel. In the short term, the fatberg will go into \"quarantine\", where it will be treated with the type of health and safety regulations surrounding sewage. Next month the collections committee at the museum will decide whether the fatberg will be kept forever as an artefact, either in storage or on display, rather than being returned to the rubbish. Ms Sparkes says she now has a \"big soft spot\" for the fatberg and says there is a \"strong case for keeping it\". Even if people have thought it was revolting, she says they have engaged with the ideas behind it - such as the consumer behaviour and type of consumption that creates fatbergs. The museum's curator says there have even been artistic responses to the fatberg - with children's stories having been written.

That gas is phosphine - a molecule made up of one phosphorus atom and three hydrogen atoms. On Earth, phosphine is associated with life, with microbes living in the guts of animals like penguins, or in oxygen-poor environments such as swamps. For sure, you can make it industrially, but there are no factories on Venus; and there are certainly no penguins. So why is this gas there, 50km up from the planet's surface? Prof Jane Greaves, from Cardiff University, UK and colleagues are asking just this question. They've published a paper in the journal Nature Astronomy detailing their observations of phosphine at Venus, as well as the investigations they've made to try to show this molecule could have a natural, non-biological origin. But for the moment, they're stumped - as they tell the BBC's Sky At Night programme, which has talked at length to the team. You can see the show on BBC Four tonight (Monday) at 22:30 BST. Given everything we know about Venus and the conditions that exist there, no-one has yet been able to describe an abiotic pathway to phosphine, not in the quantities that have been detected. This means a life source deserves consideration. \"Through my whole career I have been interested in the search for life elsewhere in the Universe, so I'm just blown away that this is even possible,\" Prof Greaves said. \"But, yes, we are genuinely encouraging other people to tell us what we might have missed. Our paper and data are open access; this is how science works.\" What exactly has the team detected? Prof Greaves' team first identified phosphine at Venus using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii, and then confirmed its presence using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile. Phosphine has a distinctive \"absorption line\" that these radio telescopes discern at a wavelength of about 1mm. The gas is observed at mid-latitudes on the planet at roughly 50-60km in altitude. The concentration is small - making up only 10-20 parts in every billion atmospheric molecules - but in this context, that's a lot. Why is this so interesting? Venus is not at the top of the list when thinking of life elsewhere in our Solar System. Compared to Earth, it's a hellhole. With 96% of the atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide, it has experienced a runaway greenhouse effect. Surface temperatures are like those in a pizza oven - over 400C. Space probes that have landed on the planet have survived just minutes before breaking down. And yet, go 50km up and it's actually \"shirtsleeves conditions\". So, if there really is life on Venus, this is exactly where we might expect to find it. Why should we be sceptical? The clouds. They're thick and they're mainly composed (75-95%) of sulphuric acid, which is catastrophic for the cellular structures that make up living organisms on Earth. Dr William Bains, who's affiliated to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, is a biochemist on the team. He's studied various combinations of different compounds expected to be on Venus; he's examined whether volcanoes, lightning and even meteorites could play a role in making PH3 - and all of the chemical reactions he's investigated, he says, are 10,000 times too weak to produce the amount of phosphine that's been observed. To survive the sulphuric acid, Dr Bains believes, airborne Venusian microbes would either have to use some unknown, radically different biochemistry, or evolve a kind of armour. \"In principle, a more water-loving life could hide itself away inside a protective shell of some sorts inside the sulphuric acid droplets,\" he told Sky At Night. \"We're talking bacteria surrounding themselves by something tougher than Teflon and completely sealing themselves in. But then how do they eat? How do they exchange gases? It's a real paradox.\" What's been the reaction? Cautious and intrigued. The team emphatically is not claiming to have found life on Venus, only that the idea needs to be further explored as scientists also hunt down any overlooked geological or abiotic chemical pathways to phosphine. Oxford University's Dr Colin Wilson worked on the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe (2006-2014), and is a leading figure in the development of a new mission concept called EnVision. He said Prof Greaves' observations would spur a new wave of research at the planet. \"It's really exciting and will lead to new discoveries - even if the original phosphine detection were to turn out to be a spectroscopic misinterpretation, which I don't think it will. I think that life in Venus' clouds today is so unlikely that we'll find other chemical pathways of creating phosphine in the atmosphere - but we'll discover lots of interesting things about Venus in this search,\" he told BBC News. Prof Lewis Dartnell from the University of Westminster is similarly cautious. He's an astrobiologist - someone who studies the possibilities of life beyond Earth. He thinks Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are a better bet to find life. \"If life can survive in the upper cloud-decks of Venus - that's very illuminating, because it means maybe life is very common in our galaxy as a whole. Maybe life doesn't need very Earth-like planets and could survive on other, hellishly-hot, Venus-like planets across the Milky Way.\" How can the question be resolved? By sending a probe to investigate specifically the atmosphere of Venus. The US space agency (Nasa) asked scientists recently to sketch the design for a potential flagship mission in the 2030s. Flagships are the most capable - and most expensive - ventures undertaken by Nasa. This particular concept proposed an aerobot, or instrumented balloon, to travel through the clouds of Venus. \"The Russians did this with their Vega balloon (in 1985),\" said team-member Prof Sara Seager from MIT. \"It was coated with Teflon to protect it from sulphuric acid and floated around for a couple of days, making measurements. \"We could definitely go make some in-situ measurements. We could concentrate the droplets and measure their properties. We could even bring a microscope along and try to look for life itself.\" The Sky At Night special on this story can be seen at 22:30 on BBC Four, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

At a summit in Malta, EU Council President Donald Tusk said that saving the EU's Schengen rules on free movement was a \"race against time\". The EU has agreed to a €1.8bn (£1.3bn) fund to help Africa tackle \"the root causes of irregular migration\". But some African leaders have already criticised the sum being offered as insufficient. Some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have crossed the Mediterranean from Africa this year, but this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. Tensions in the EU have been rising because of the pressures faced by those countries where most migrants initially arrive, particularly Greece, Italy and Hungary. Many then head to Germany or Sweden - the two nations regarded as the most welcoming to refugees - to claim asylum. Mr Tusk said recent developments in Sweden, Germany, Slovenia and elsewhere had shown \"with utmost clarity the huge pressure member states are facing\". 'Another system' needed Sweden said the temporary controls came into effect at midday local time on Thursday and will last initially for 10 days. Checks began on trains crossing the Oresund Bridge between Sweden and Denmark and at terminals for ferries arriving from Denmark and Germany. Police indicated not all vehicles crossing the bridge would be checked. Nearly 200,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Sweden this year, more per head of population than any other EU nation. \"This is not an issue for one or two or three countries - this is an issue for the whole European Union,\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said at the Malta talks. \"We need another system - that is obvious.\" More on the migrant crisis Katya Adler - How Sweden's far-right has gained from the crisis Crisis in graphics - Migrant countries of origin, routes and destinations Impact of arrivals - How one German city is coping Swedish Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said the centre-left government had acted \"in order to obtain security and stability... not to limit the number of asylum seekers, but to get better control of the flow of asylum seekers to Sweden\". Swedish immigration officials say the introduction of temporary border controls will help them register new arrivals and prevent people from staying in the country illegally. Fredrik Bengtsson, spokesman for the Swedish Migration Agency, said it was currently picking up people by bus at the border and driving them to its offices, but \"once they get there quite a lot don't enter and get registered but disappear\". Cash for help The summit of EU and African leaders in the Maltese capital Valletta was planned after about 800 people died in a migrant boat sinking off Libya in April. It has been looking at ways to reduce the flow of migrants by helping tackle economic and security problems in African states, and at accelerating repatriation of failed asylum-seekers. African leaders are insisting on a much clearer path for smaller numbers of their citizens to migrate officially to Europe. Also on Thursday, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked EU member states to donate a total of €2.5bn to a fund to support Turkey's efforts to tackle the migration crisis. Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC News, Valletta It is almost always a good idea to get together, shake hands and smile - the importance of political engagement at the very highest level should not be under-estimated. But there are still some fairly fundamental differences of emphasis between Europe and Africa when it comes to how best to tackle the migration crisis. That is hardly surprising because it is a one-way street - an unequal partnership. And efforts to balance things up involve policies such as conflict resolution and poverty reduction that will take decades to bear fruit. The trust fund established today is new money and it will fund new projects. African leaders would like it to be bigger, but overall this deal can have a positive impact. One practical example is a European promise to reduce the cost to migrant workers of sending money back to Africa. Remittances remain a backbone of many national economies. Nevertheless there remains deep scepticism in Africa about European demands to accept the return of far more of the people that EU countries want to expel. That will remain a serious point of contention. Despite a series of high-level meetings over the migration crisis, the EU remains deeply divided on how to deal with the issue. Hungary has criticised Germany's announcement that it planned to send more Syrian refugees back to the first EU country they had entered - excluding Greece - and Croatia has condemned its neighbour Slovenia for building a razor-wire fence along their mutual border. EU leaders have agreed a controversial programme to redistribute thousands of migrants - but so far only about 130 have been successfully moved from Greece and Italy. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "瑞典决定实施临时边境检查措施，以控制进入瑞典的移民潮。"}

On Thursday, the government had said it wanted to assess how many students would be successfully reallocated to alternative institutions before the UKBA sent out the 60-day notices. It said a task force had been set up to help affected students and provide advice via an LMU helpline on 020 7133 4141. 'Rewriting' guidelines The UKBA said London Metropolitan University had \"failed to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago. It said many foreign students at the university had no right to be in the UK. Professor Malcolm Gillies, the university's vice chancellor, described the claims made against the institution as \"not particularly cogent\" and said it would be disputing them. \"I would go so far as to say that UKBA has been rewriting its own guidelines on this issue and this is something which should cause concern to all universities in the UK,\" he said. Although there have been other suspensions, no other UK university has been fully stripped of its ability to recruit overseas students.", "summary": "英国边境署(UK Border Agency)将期限放宽到至少2012年12月1日，以便利受到影响的大约2600名伦敦都会大学(London Metropolitan University)的海外学生重新择校。"}

The licence was suspended, but with only weeks before term, the university does not know if it will be reinstated. The university's head, Malcolm Gillies, says the delay is \"hugely worrying\". The UK Border Agency (UKBA) has said that no decision has been reached. 'Urgent' If the university's right to sponsor overseas students is withdrawn, it is also expected to affect existing overseas students, who might have to find places at other universities, with this year's admissions already closed for many courses. Mr Vaz has written to Immigration Minister Damian Green asking for clarification over whether the university is going to lose its \"highly trusted sponsor\" status. While supporting efforts to \"clamp down on the abuse of student visas\", Mr Vaz said: \"For the sake of this university and others, especially at this time of year, I hope the minister will urgently clarify the situation.\" London Metropolitan had its highly trusted sponsor status suspended in July - which prevented it from being allowed to recruit overseas students. The UKBA says it will not comment on why the licence was suspended - but a newspaper report says that the university had been accused of being a \"threat to immigration control\", a claim denied by the university. But with the new term approaching, there has been no decision on whether the licence will be revoked or reinstated. The university's vice chancellor Malcolm Gillies said the continuing doubt was \"hugely worrying\" for the university students and staff. Professor Gillies also warned of the damage to the wider UK higher education sector as it competed with other countries to recruit overseas students. \"What message will it send abroad?\" he said. Anxiety Although there have been other suspensions, so far no UK university has been fully stripped of its ability to recruit overseas students. As well as stopping the university from accepting new applications, losing the licence could also affect thousands of existing overseas students at the university, who might be in their second or third years. According to the information published by the UKBA, if a university has its licence withdrawn, overseas students would only have permission to stay in the UK for 60 days. During this time, students would have to find another university or college to sponsor them. In the case of London Metropolitan this would affect about 2,700 current overseas students, who will have already paid for one or more years of a degree course. Overseas students have become an important income for universities - and blocking their recruitment will have considerable financial implications. The university has warned of a \"growing £10m-plus hole\" from the delay, which is continuing through the peak of the clearing process, when empty places are allocated. Threat to courses Professor Gillies says that the viability of many courses - both at London Metropolitan and other universities - depended on overseas students. The withdrawal of overseas students would mean a considerable \"re-configuring\" of courses, he said. There have been newspaper reports claiming that the licence was going to be withdrawn - but the UKBA says a final decision has not been made. In response, Prof Gillies had said: \"To learn that we might have our highly trusted sponsor status revoked via a newspaper, with the panic that this can cause for thousands of students, is outrageous.\" A statement for the university said its priority was to provide advice to students and applicants \"who have put their faith in our institution\". \"They will need clear information on their options for future study and timelines for securing those options,\" it said. The students' union at the university says it has received \"hundreds of phone calls\" from worried students and their families. \"They are really scared about their future. These genuine students, coming from different parts of the world, are in a miserable situation,\" said Adnan Pavel, vice president of the students' union at London Metropolitan. The National Union of Students called for immediate clarification about the consequences for students \"plunged into disarray\" by reports the licence would be withdrawn. \"This situation is already costing real students, real money and real distress,\" said NUS president Liam Burns. A statement from the UKBA said: \"Any education provider has to meet strict standards, ensuring they provide high quality education, and take their immigration responsibilities seriously. We will not tolerate any abuse of the immigration system.\" There has been a long-standing balancing act between financial pressures to recruit more overseas students and concerns student visas were being misused as a way of entering the UK. University leaders have called for overseas students not to be included in the target to reduce migration figures, but this was rejected by ministers.", "summary": "英国一名主要议员呼吁内政部紧急澄清伦敦都会大学是否将被允许教授和招收海外学生。"}

Labour's Stephen Twigg attacked \"shallow\" changes lacking in evidence. Mr Twigg accused Mr Gove of \"cutting back on re-sits, while affording himself a fourth attempt at GCSE reform\". Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, said the constant change in exams was turning pupils into \"Mr Gove's guinea pigs\". 'Merit' Head teachers' leader Russell Hobby said the plans for a \"more rigorous exam to the existing GCSE contain merit\" but warned against an over-hasty implementation. \"We need to take time to get any new assessment system right.\" Wales and Northern Ireland are keeping GCSEs, but so far are not adopting the changes proposed for England. Ofqual head Glenys Stacey says: \"We want to see qualifications that are more stretching for the most able students, using assessments that really test knowledge, understanding and skills.\" There is no sign of a change in name to I-level for the English exams - as had been rumoured. Key changes from autumn 2015 The reforms will initially apply to a group of core subjects - English language and literature, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, combined science, history and geography. 'Whole book' Hundreds of thousands of pupils will begin studying these revised GCSEs from autumn 2015 and the first candidates to take the exams will be in summer 2017. Apart from exceptions such as practical experiments in science, there will be a shift towards results depending fully on exams taken at the end of two years. It will mean removing the 25% of marks in history, English literature and geography that are currently allowed for controlled assessments. Grading will be by numbers rather than letters - with 8 at the top and 1 at the bottom. The pass mark will be pushed higher, with claims it will compare with the highest-performing school systems, such as Finland and Shanghai. But the National Union of Teachers said Finland used a high level of the type of student assessment being removed from exams in England. The new GCSEs will push for a more stretching, essay-based exam system, reminiscent of O-levels, taken by pupils until the late 1980s. Mr Gove told MPs that previous course specifications \"were too vague\" and had caused \"suspicion and speculation that some exam boards were 'harder' than others\". History will require more study of British history. Pupils will have to write an in-depth study of a 25-to-50-year period within a range of eras stretching from 500AD to the present day. There will be a less prominent world history section and pupils will be asked to study a theme such as changes in politics, religion or culture across the medieval, early modern and modern eras. In English literature, exam questions will be designed to ensure that pupils have read the whole book. The course content will include at least one play by Shakespeare, a selection of work by the Romantic poets, a 19th Century novel, a selection of poetry since 1850 and a 20th Century novel or drama. For both English language and literature, digital texts are excluded. Maths will promote the idea of developing independent problem-solving skills, rather than setting types of questions that can be rehearsed. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: \"We do need to start competing against those top performing countries in the world, because for too long we've pretended that students' results are getting better, when all that's been happening is the exams have been getting easier.\" Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said his greatest concern was about the proposed syllabus changes. \"Simply making exams harder does not guarantee higher standards or mean that students will be prepared for a job. The curriculum should stretch and challenge the highest achieving students but it must also engage and motivate those who struggle at the other end.\" 'Rushed' This is the latest stage in Mr Gove's drive to reconfigure the exam system. Last year, Mr Gove announced plans for the scrapping of GCSEs and their replacement with English Baccalaureate Certificates, with each subject to be set by a single exam board. This re-branding was scrapped, with GCSEs to be retained but reformed instead. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said the the government's approach was \"rushed\". \"If you did this by consensus, by actually talking to the profession and understanding how best to examine things, we would be in a much better position.\" Chris Keates, leader of the Nasuwt teachers' union, attacked the government's claim that the GCSE was a \"broken qualification\" and said it had \"proved itself to be a robust and reliable qualification\". She accused the government of driving an \"inaccurate and ideologically-driven media attack on the qualification\". The latest plans will be put out to consultation over the summer, with a timetable that will see exam boards producing courses to be accredited by Ofqual for teaching in autumn 2015. The prospect of different forms of GCSEs in England, and Wales and Northern Ireland has raised the question of how they will be distinguished from each other. The CBI said employers would want to be \"crystal clear about the differences to eliminate any confusion\".", "summary": "英国教育大臣迈克·高夫星期日（10日）宣布修改英国教学大纲，包括汉语在内的外语，将成为英国小学生从三年级开始的必修课。"}

Mr Schmidt now chairs the Pentagon's Defence Innovation Board. The UK is currently reviewing whether to continue letting Huawei help build its 5G mobile networks amid growing pressure to exclude the Chinese firm. \"There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security,\" Mr Schmidt told a BBC Radio 4 documentary. He said it was possible to think of the company as a means of \"signals intelligence\" - a reference to spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. \"There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,\" Mr Schmidt added. \"However that happened, we're sure it happened.\" Huawei has consistently denied accusations that it is an arm of the Chinese state, or passes on customer data to the authorities. \"The allegations made by Eric Schmidt, who now works for the US government, are simply not true and as with similar assertions in the past, are not backed by evidence,\" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief told the BBC. \"Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government. \"Where we do agree, and something we've always said, is that applying standards globally ensures innovation, fosters competition and benefits everyone.\" Anti-China prejudices Eric Schmidt says the real issue with Huawei lies in the challenge to US leadership it represents: a Chinese company operating on a global stage that is building a better product than its competitors. \"It's extremely important that we have choices,\" he told the BBC. \"The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good.\" Eric Schmidt spent a decade and a half as chief executive and then executive chairman of Google and its parent company Alphabet. He acknowledges that over a long career in Silicon Valley, he had underestimated China's ability to innovate. \"I have carried the prejudices about China in my years working with them,\" he said. \"That they're very good at copying things, that they're very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they're not going to do anything new. They're very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff. Those prejudices need to be thrown out. \"The Chinese are just as good, and maybe better, in key areas of research and innovation as the West. \"They're putting more money into it. They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete.\" He denies the Chinese model of state-directed investment in technology is intrinsically more successful than a free-market model. However, he believes the West needs to make the most of its strengths by: \"Most people would prefer to live and work in the West than work in China,\" he says. Catching up One of the problems in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley, Mr Schmidt believes, is a historical blindness to the role of the government in supporting research. \"Everything you see in Silicon Valley to the first order came from initial federal science grants of one kind or another.\" Last year he chaired a US National Security Commission looking at artificial intelligence. China's advances in this field are a major concern. \"I would say they are a few years behind,\" he says. \"Not five years, and not 10 years. And there's evidence of China closing the gap in the next few years. \"So the question is: what happens then? Well obviously, artificial intelligence has military and national security applications.\" China's work on quantum computing, he adds, is on a par with that of the West, and could even be ahead. Mr Schmidt views the decoupling of the technology sectors in China and the US as \"undesirable\", believing it will lead to two distinct systems. \"Once you diverge these global platforms, you don't get them back,\" he says. \"We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less. \"China's going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. \"The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is. \"It is in the West's interest that every technology platform has Western values in them.\" Rough rivalry Mr Schmidt is cautious about picking national champions and supporting them. But he says there are weaknesses in the West's own capacity, particularly in not having foundries that manufacture semiconductor chips. He says it would be better for China to use chips from Western companies rather than build its own. The rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world is of \"great concern\", he concludes, pointing to the fact that more than half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have been founded by foreign-born nationals. Faced with a challenge from China, he draws on his own Silicon Valley experience. \"The best strategy is to think of it as a competition not unlike the tech companies, where there's brutal competition,\" he said. \"[It will be] as rough as it could be - largely unregulated between the various players - where we seek to win.\" The New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00 BST.", "summary": "美国高科技巨头谷歌前总裁、现任五角大楼国防创新委员会主任的埃里克·施密特（Eric Schmidt）在接受BBC广播四台专题节目《新科技冷战》访问时指称，华为从事了“令人无法接受的行为”，对西方国家构成“国家安全挑战”。"}

But it was clear Vladimir Putin, 67, had change in mind. With four years to go before he leaves office, and 20 years already served, it was clear he was planning ahead. A new government, led by Mikhail Mishustin, a technocrat who turned Russia's hated tax service into an efficient operation, and the end of a man who has worked hand in glove with Mr Putin since he became president. Dmitry Medvedev even filled in as president for four years, because under the constitution Mr Putin could not. Mr Medvedev, the unpopular head of the United Russia party, is not going away, but his new role as deputy head of Russia's security council is far more behind the scenes. \"It's a golden parachute. It means he is in reserve, as the security council is Putin's closest inner circle - his own mini-government,\" says Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Center. Mr Putin is coming to the same point he reached after his second term, when Dmitry Medvedev deputised for him. But this time the president will not take a false backseat as prime minister. It now appears that Mr Putin's fourth term as president will be his last. So what does he want instead? On the face of it, it means more powers for parliament - selecting the prime minister and approving the cabinet, for a start. But that won't happen yet. Mr Putin has chosen Mr Medvedev's successor and parliament will have to ratify him. As for any further powers for parliament, that is still unclear. \"They'll be the same MPs, not much will change,\" says Sergei Goryashko of BBC Russian. What President Putin is suggesting is a public vote on changing the constitution - the first such vote since 1993. One of the standout proposals is making the State Council a formal government agency enshrined in the constitution. At the moment it is an advisory body packed with 85 regional governors and other officials including political party leaders. It is so large that when it meets it fills a hall in the Kremlin. But Mr Putin clearly has designs on its future. One theory is that he could become a new, powerful leader of the State Council. \"The very fact he's started a discussion on the State Council is that he's maybe trying to create another place where power resides, where he can step above the presidential post,\" Mr Baunov suggests. Mr Putin wants to remain in power, the question is how, says Sergei Goryashko. We are now almost sure he will not remain president after 2024, it is which role he chooses to fill. It could even be in his existing role as head of the security council. Sam Greene, head of the Russia Institute at King's College London, believes that elites looking to secure their future after 2024 will \"now have to play on at least three chess boards simultaneously\" - defining the roles of the Duma (parliament), the State Council and Mr Putin himself. Using a similar analogy, commentator Konstantin Eggert said it was the \"same meaningless chess designed to imitate novelty\" while ultimately preserving the status quo. What reaction has there been? For Alexei Navalny, the biggest opposition threat to President Putin, this marks a return to Soviet-style politics and any vote on changes to the constitution would be a fraud. Fellow activist Lyubov Sobol was equally scathing: \"Swapping some thieving guys for other thieving guys is neither reform nor regeneration.\" Others compared the resignation of the widely unpopular Mr Medvedev to the fall of Mr Putin's earlier prime minister, Mikhail Fradkov, a year before the president's second term ended. Although the new candidate is a respected technocrat who has reformed the tax service, he is little known. Mr Fradkov was also replaced by an unknown, Viktor Zubkov, who lasted only a few months in the job.", "summary": "它毫无先兆地就发生了。看起来，事前就连俄罗斯政府内的各部长都不知道自己即将要离职。"}

The NYPD did not provide further details. The US academy, which has handed out 81 Oscars to films produced by Weinstein's Miramax studio and the Weinstein Company, said it would meet on Saturday to \"discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the academy\". A statement has also been issued by Cannes Film Festival, which Weinstein has attended many times. President Pierre Lescure said they have been \"dismayed to learn of the accusations\". \"These actions point to a pattern of behaviour that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation. \"Our thoughts go out to the victims, to those who have had the courage to testify and to all the others. May this case help us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.\" Meanwhile, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told CNN she felt \"sick\" about the allegations surrounding Weinstein, pledging to donate money he had raised for her campaigns to charity. Weinstein reportedly raised more than $1.4m (£1.05m) for Democratic groups, and Republicans have accused Democrats of not doing enough to distance themselves from him. 'Powerless and scared' A string of high-profile actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have come forward to accuse the movie producer of sexual harassment or assault. British actress and model Cara Delevingne is one of the latest to accuse him of inappropriate behaviour. In a statement, she said he tried to kiss her as she tried to leave a hotel room. \"I felt very powerless and scared,\" she said. The French actress Léa Seydoux has written an article detailing her experience with Weinstein who she met at a fashion show. She wrote in The Guardian about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. \"We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. \"I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.\" On Tuesday, Weinstein denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine. On the same day, his wife Georgina Chapman said she was leaving him. Oscar-nominated actress Annette Bening said Weinstein was well known in Hollywood for being \"boorish\", but that she had not known the extent of his alleged behaviour. \"I certainly didn't know that this was going on to the degree that it was,\" she told BBC News. \"It's terrible. And it's great that these women have come forward. I really respect them. Maybe it's a tipping point. Maybe culturally this means that things will change.\" On Wednesday, US prosecutors defended their decision not to take action against Weinstein after a woman complained about his behaviour in 2015. The Manhattan district attorney's office said undercover audio of the complainant and Weinstein was \"insufficient to prove a crime\". Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 22, had gone to police to accuse Weinstein of touching her inappropriately. She then agreed to meet the producer again while wearing a hidden microphone. The district attorney's office said police arranged the meeting without informing them. \"Prosecutors were not afforded the opportunity before the meeting to counsel investigators on what was necessary to capture in order to prove a misdemeanour sex crime,\" they said. They said the \"horrifying\" audio \"was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law\" which left prosecutors with \"no choice but to conclude the criminal investigation without charges\". In the recording, Weinstein can be heard asking Ms Gutierrez to come into his hotel room.

The US wants China to cease building coal-fired power stations and to stop financing coal ventures abroad. China wants the US to give more cash to developing countries to obtain clean technology and adapt to climate change. It also wants Washington to announce deep cuts in emissions. Speaking to CNN, Mr Kerry said China's co-operation was \"absolutely critical\" to battle the climate crisis. \"Yes, we have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone.\" He is hoping to salvage the superpower relationship to allow progress at President Biden’s virtual summit on 22 and 23 April. Scientists warn that without an agreement between the world’s great polluters there’s little chance of averting dangerous climate change. Bernice Lee, a China expert at the UK think tank Chatham House, said: “This is good news. At least they’re talking in the run-up to the summit. There will be big issues for both sides to resolve. But they must be resolved.\" Neither party has formally declared its climate masterplan to the UN, and each is struggling to coax more concessions from the other. The US was absent from climate negotiations during President Donald Trump’s term of office and it is now being urged to cut emissions to between 57%-63% below 2005 levels this decade. President Biden is expected to declare the formal US offer before, or at, next week’s summit. China, meanwhile, has pledged to peak its emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (that means cutting out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels but still allowing farm emissions of methane – another planet-heating gas). It will be pressed to explain the policies that will achieve those targets. Byford Tsang from the think tank E3G told BBC News: “The US has been pushing Japan and South Korea to end overseas coal finance. It will also be pressing the Chinese to stop constructing coal plants in their Belt and Road initiative. \"It will also want action on China’s domestic coal use. China is operating half the world’s coal capacity – and it’s still been expanding despite the pandemic.” The Belt and Road initiative is a sweeping Chinese infrastructure project aimed at expanding global trade links. The US will also hope to persuade President Xi to attend next week’s virtual summit. Forty world leaders have been invited, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The summit is a key milestone ahead of the UN climate Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow this November. Climate scientists warn that global heating needs to be kept well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aim for an increasingly ambitious 1.5C goal, to avoid the worst of climate breakdown.

The study analysed 69 capital projects at the group's 24 member institutions. The group's director general, Wendy Piatt, said investment would help keep UK universities among the world's best. The study looked at building plans for the four years to March 2017. Projects range from new student accommodation to medical research facilities, science labs, office space and facilities to help start-up businesses and universities work better together. Campus masterplan They include Sheffield University's £81m engineering building, expected to open in 2016. The university says the building will: Sheffield has already built a new student union and a management school. At Manchester University a new engineering campus and redeveloped business school are part of a £1bn plan for the next 10 years. In London, Imperial College is building a new campus at White City, part of it on the site of former BBC offices. The University of Cambridge plans to spend £1bn on \"the largest single capital development project in its 800-year history\" on farmland to the north-west of the city. Birmingham University is building a £55m sports centre for students, staff and the wider community, which will include the city's first 50m (165ft) swimming pool, a state-of-the-art library and a cultural centre.

Mr Doria has previously touted Sinovac's experimental vaccine, announcing plans to use it to inoculate residents of São Paulo.

The sentence angered many officers, who believe it was unjust and too harsh. About 33,000 people attended Wednesday night's gathering at a police recreation ground, according to police associations which organised the event. Organisers said they would help the jailed officers appeal against their convictions and clear their names, reported RTHK. Many were heard yelling \"Fight for justice\" at the two-hour rally, one of the largest of its kind and a rare sign of police dissent. Shocking incident The seven officers were sentenced to jail last week for assaulting social worker and activist Ken Tsang in 2014. TV cameras had caught the officers removing Mr Tsang from the protest area to a nearby park and kicking and punching him as he lay on the ground. It came at the height of the massive street protests calling for greater political freedom, which shut down central areas of the territory for weeks. The incident shocked Hong Kong, where police are generally well regarded. Mr Tsang was himself found guilty of assaulting and resisting officers on the same evening. In sentencing the policemen, Judge David Dufton noted they had been working under \"immense stress\" but that there was \"no justification\" for their actions.

In a speech, US President Barack Obama sought to reassure Asia-Pacific allies of the US' commitment to the region. Vladimir Putin is expected to face a hostile reception from some Western leaders concerned about Russia's increasing military assertiveness. Speaking ahead of the G20 summit, the Russian president said US and EU sanctions imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine would harm not just Russia but the global economy. Meanwhile, President Obama said the US believed that security in the Asia-Pacific region must depend on international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes. \"We believe... that any effective security order for Asia must be based not on spheres of influence, or coercion or intimidation where big nations bully the small, but on alliances for mutual security, international law and norms that are upheld, and the peaceful resolution of disputes,\" he said. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott previously said world leaders would use the summit to discuss job creation, identifying tax cheats and strengthening the global economy. Leaders are expected to expand on plans agreed in February at the G20 finance ministers' meeting to boost global economic growth by 2% in five years. However the crisis in Ukraine and the threat of Ebola are also expected to be discussed at the summit, while campaigners want climate change on the agenda. \"Obviously I would like this discussion to focus on the politics of economic reform,\" Mr Abbott said as he opened the session on Saturday. \"In the end, though, this is your retreat, it is open to any of you to raise any subject that you wish.\" The BBC's Linda Yueh in Brisbane says that while the global economy is the official focus of the summit, the agenda is likely to reflect what the people around the table are concerned about - including Ukraine, the spread of Ebola and climate change. Our correspondent says the question will be how much can be achieved by leaders of the G20 nations with so much to discuss in just two days. In early developments: Brisbane, in the state of Queensland, is said to be taking unprecedented security measures for the summit, with some 6,000 police deployed. Twenty-seven different groups have been given permits to protest at designated areas near the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, the venue hosting the meeting, and thousands of people are expected over the weekend. More than 200 protesters buried their heads in the sands of Bondi Beach on Thursday in a demonstration over climate change inaction. Earlier in the week, the US and China made what US President Barack Obama described as \"historic\" pledges on emissions, with the US promising greater cuts and China for the first time setting a date by which emissions would peak. Australia has, however, stood firm on keeping climate change off the agenda of the G20 summit. The government is facing criticism over its climate policies. Since coming to power, Mr Abbott has axed a carbon tax and overseen a 70% fall in investment in renewable energy. Eyes will also be on President Putin, amid tensions over Russia's role in Ukraine. Some Australians had called for Mr Putin to be blocked from the summit over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Thirty-eight Australians were among the 298 people who died when the plane was brought down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, by a missile that the West believes was supplied by Russia. Russia rejects the claim. Mr Abbott, who discussed the issue with Mr Putin in Beijing earlier this week, described Russia's actions in Ukraine as part of a \"regrettable pattern\" by a nation that was being \"much more assertive\". He said he told Mr Putin that Russia should aspire to be a superpower \"for peace and freedom and prosperity\" instead of \"trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union\".

The videos showed her performing sex acts with a number of unidentified men. \"She was beautiful but fragile,\" remembers Teresa Petrosino, a friend for 15 years. \"She was with the wrong people at the wrong time.\" The videos were soon shared and uploaded to several adult websites. The physical actions on the tapes did not stand out. But a single sentence from Tiziana Cantone did. \"You're making a video?\" she asked the man holding the camera. \"Bravo!\" The words suggested an uninhibited young woman, who enjoyed being filmed during sex. By accident, the phrase gave viewers licence to watch the video without reservations: if she was so happy to be filmed, she wouldn't mind them watching. But Italians did more than watch. Users soon turned her comment into a meme-worthy punchline. Her image appeared on t-shirts and parody websites. No-one seemed to worry what the subject herself might think as she seemed so pleased about it. But this was a profound misunderstanding. \"People confuse being an uninhibited person with wanting to go viral,\" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. \"You can film a video, share it with some people but there's a tacit agreement that you won't share it further.\" Legal battle Tiziana Cantone, a fragile woman, was horrified. \"She and I never actually spoke about the details of the video,\" says her friend Teresa. \"I never saw them, and I never want to see them. You could tell she was suffering a lot. But she was strong.\" Read more here: How Italians reacted to Tiziana's death Ms Cantone decided to fight back. But there was no immediate way to get the videos taken down. She took the case to court, arguing the tapes were uploaded to public sites without her consent. By this time, she was no longer able to live a normal life. \"She didn't want to go out as people would recognise her. She realised that the virtual world and the real world were the same thing,\" Teresa explains. \"She understood at some point that the situation would never be resolved; that a potential husband, her potential children could find those videos; that they would never disappear.\" Tiziana Cantone retreated to her family home in a quiet street in Mugnano, a working-class suburb of Naples. It took her mother, Maria Teresa Giglio, weeks to find the strength to tell reporters about her daughter's life. \"My daughter was a good girl but she was also vulnerable,\" she told the BBC. \"She lacked a paternal figure, from birth. She never met her father. This affected her entire life.\" Mother and daughter lived together. In happier times, Tiziana listened to Italian singers, read novels and played the piano. But after the intimate videos were shared online, she withdrew. \"Her life was ruined, in front of everyone,\" says her mother. \"People made fun of her, parodies ended up on pornographic websites. She was called shameful names.\" In September, a court in Naples ordered the intimate videos to be removed from several websites and search engines. But the court also ordered her to pay €20,000 (£17,200, $21,600) in legal costs. It was all too much. On 13 September 2016, Maria Teresa Giglio went to work at the local town hall. Her daughter stayed at home. Ms Giglio received a phone call at work. \"My sister-in-law called me, and in a calm voice told me to come home; when I got here I saw the police, the ambulance, and I quickly understood,\" she says, breaking down. \"My sister-in-law tried to pick her up and save her. My neighbours didn't allow me to get out of my car. I almost fainted. They didn't want to let me into this house. I wasn't even able to see her for a last time. \"The day she died, my life ended.\" One day later, Maria Teresa Giglio buried her daughter in a white coffin. The notice outside the funeral described her as a \"sweet, beautiful, fragile angel\". Who posted the videos? There is a sad paradox at the heart of Tiziana Cantone's death. By taking her own life, she drew even more attention to the videos she hoped everyone might forget. Her mother has forced herself to watch the tapes. \"You can only imagine what it is like. I wanted to see details that would allow me to understand the truth. That was not my Tiziana,\" she says, convinced that her daughter was under the effect of drugs. She believes that the distribution of the videos didn't happen by chance. \"It's as if this was a premeditated, criminal plan. They just wanted to show the face of this poor girl, with the intention of exposing her on the internet.\" Read more here: In particular, Ms Giglio wants her daughter's former boyfriend, Mr Di Palo, to explain exactly what role he had in the sharing of the videos. \"He didn't help me to save her life. But maybe he can help me get to the truth. I'm desperate.\" In November 2016, prosecutors questioned Mr Di Palo for 10 hours. They wanted to know whether anyone was guilty of inciting Tiziana's suicide. Mr Di Palo declined our request for an interview. \"We refrain from making comments, out of respect for poor Tiziana who suffered so much due to the enormous publicity that her case received,\" says Bruno Larosa, Mr Di Palo's lawyer. \"We trust the courts and it should be noted that my client is not accused of anything.\" Legacy of Tiziana's death In the aftermath of Tiziana Cantone's suicide, the tone of Italy's debate about pornography and privacy has changed. \"I think this case did make a difference, quite drastically, to the way that Italian journalists talk about these cases of revenge porn,\" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. \"They used to have a very carefree approach, and her death changed it. In subsequent cases, one of them involving a celebrity, they were a lot more cautious.\" But there is also a lesson for anyone who chooses to share intimate videos online. \"People think that their virtual life and their real life are parallel realities,\" warns Ms Lucarelli. \"They're not. They coincide. The web is our life. So anything that you don't do in real life you shouldn't do online.\" Tiziana's videos can no longer be found on the main search engines but they still exist. Her mother wants Italy and the rest of the EU to agree a much faster way to get private material removed from the internet and make the big internet firms act responsibly. \"I speak on behalf of other mothers who may be suffering like me,\" she says. Italy's privacy tsar, Antonello Soro, agrees things have to change but does not specify what the government might do. \"We need a quicker response mechanism from different online platforms, but it is also necessary to increase respect online,\" he said in a statement. \"We need strong investment in digital education to promote a culture and sensibility that are adequate to the new online world.\" For Tiziana's mother, life is now a fight to defend her daughter's name, and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. \"I hope that the name Tiziana Cantone, instead of standing for mockery, becomes a name that could save the lives of other women. I would like this to happen. To save other people.\" Are you affected by this?

The US has traditionally sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not abide by the vote. Israel announced its ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal had been ordered to return for consultations. Israel has no diplomatic ties with Malaysia and Venezuela. The Palestinian leadership welcomed the UN resolution, which was passed by 14 votes to zero, with one abstention. President-elect Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, tweeted after the vote: \"As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians, who see them as an obstacle to peace. About 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay US policy reverse: By Barbara Plett Usher The resolution reflects an international consensus that the growth of Israeli settlement-building has come to threaten the viability of a Palestinian state in any future peace deal. It is a view strongly shared by the Obama administration, and for that reason the US reversed its policy of vetoing any UN Security Council criticism of Israel. It is a decision that was taken after months of debate within the administration about whether and how President Obama might be able to define his position on a two-state solution before leaving office. But his successor Donald Trump has made clear he intends to strongly support Israeli government positions, even making a highly unorthodox intervention before the vote by publicly urging Mr Obama to veto the resolution. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said: \"Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms. \"At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall 'occupied territory'. \"The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes. Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\" The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said the resolution reflected the \"facts on the ground\" that settlement growth had been accelerating. \"The settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is threatening the two-state solution,\" she said. She criticised Mr Netanyahu's support for settlement expansion, saying: \"One cannot simultaneously champion expanding settlements and champion a two-state solution that would end the conflict.\" However, Ms Power added that the US had not voted in favour of the resolution because it was \"too narrowly focused\" on settlements. She added that even if all settlements were dismantled, both sides would still have to acknowledge \"uncomfortable truths\" and make \"difficult choices\" to reach peace. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said: \"The Security Council resolution is a big blow to Israeli policy, a unanimous international condemnation of settlements and a strong support for the two-state solution.\" On Thursday, Mr Trump had urged the Security Council to defeat the motion. \"Peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" he said in a statement. \"This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\"", "summary": "联合国安理会通过一项决议，敦促结束以色列非法定居点，在这之前美国没有否决这项决议。"}

The vast majority of her 110 million-strong Instagram following are young and female, fitting firmly within the brand's target market. Her success can be viewed squarely within larger trends in the global beauty industry, which has undergone a huge shift as social media influencers and vloggers become more important to a brand's success. Kylie launched her first set of own-brand lip kits in November 2015. The product choice was not incidental, as the internet had spent much of the previous two years speculating on the teen's noticeably larger lips. At first the reality star alleged the change was achieved using clever make-up tricks (over-lining the lips and filling in with a natural-looking matte base). Some mocked and sparked a viral, and painful, challenge to plump their own lips, but beauty bloggers avidly recreated her look. The products she was rumoured to use sold out at MAC outlets across the world. Kylie and \"momager\" Kris saw an opportunity to go it alone. She spent months trailing an initial three-shade launch of lip kits - a combination of nude lip liner and matte lip cream combos - on Instagram and Snapchat. The initial stock launch sold out in less than a minute, crashing the website. Bloggers offered suggestions of \"dupe\" options for those not lucky enough to grab their own, and the $29 (£22) dollar sets were bootlegged online for hundreds of dollars. After launching the debut kits, she relabelled her business Kylie Cosmetics and sales continue to soar, making a reported $19m in one day in late 2016. In just a couple of years she has amassed a reported $630m (£470m) in sales, diversifying from lip kit duos to other products such as glosses, highlighters and eye-shadows. The brand has kept people hooked by maintaining the initial FOMO (fear of missing out) exclusivity - using countdowns to reveal products and selling them on limited release, often in collaboration with her famous siblings. Kylie Cosmetics is not alone; a host of grassroots brands such as Huda beauty and Anastasia Beverley Hills have soared in popularity in recent years. YouTube endorsements in particular have the power to make a product a \"must have\". A seismic change Stephanie Saltzman, beauty editor at Fashionista, says it cannot be overstated how significant influencers and online marketing have been. She describes the recent change as a \"democratisation\" within an industry that she believed had gone stale in its approach. \"Maybe historically consumers would use what their Mom used, or would go explore a beauty counter in a department store. Now it's in the palm of their hands through social media,\" she says. \"It feels more authentic coming from a person and Kylie Jenner is a person as opposed to a blanket, faceless corporation.\" Traditional make-up brands are adjusting, though. Some have collaborated with influencers and beauty vloggers on limited-edition lines or have enlisted to use Generation Z celebrities such as Lily-Rose Depp to be their public face. Charlotte Libby, a colour cosmetics expert at analyst group Mintel, says young consumers are rejecting traditional advertising, instead being drawn to brand transparency, and especially \"personality, belief and ethics\". \"Crowdfunding campaigns and social media have brought down some of the barriers for new brands and levelled the playing field,\" she tells the BBC. \"Social media and the success of influencers has proved that personality sells, and partnering with real people, rather than traditional media, offers brand the opportunity to show more personality.\" The Forbes cover profile points out that the overhead size of Kylie's company is exceptionally small. It has only 12 employees, and only seven are full-time. Most of the company's operations and production needs are outsourced to specialist firms. \"As ultra light start ups go, Jenner's operation is essentially air. And because of those miniscule overhead and marketing costs, the profits are outsize and go right into Jenner's pocket,\" journalist Natalie Robehmed writes. Kylie's self-driven success and huge profits haven't been lost on sister Kim, who has followed suit by launching a new beauty line of her own and a range of new fragrances. After a social-media-heavy marketing campaign that involved sending elaborately packaged perfumes to celebrities and influencers, Kim's initial fragrance offering sold out rapidly, raking in $10m (£7.5m) before a single paying customer had even smelt the products. \"I think that was definitely a wake-up call for a lot of others in the industry, and the same can be said with Kylie and everything she has accomplished,\" says Fashionista editor Saltzman. \"I think they feel threatened and also feel inspired. I interviewed Kim right after that fragrance launch and she was saying some big corporations had come to her for advice.\" In the beauty industry in particular then, it seems that the Kardashians might actually be the ones to keep up with.", "summary": "被中国网民称作金小妹的凯莉·詹娜（Kylie Jenner）是美国卡戴珊-詹娜家族（the Kardashian-Jenner family）最年轻的继承人。"}

Mr Trump's plan leaves large welfare programmes untouched, despite Republican calls for reform. The president has consulted government agencies about his plans and will present his budget to Congress in May. Between now and then, he needs to identify where the agencies can make savings and work out what he does with tax reform. Republican John McCain said the $603bn defence budget - which was outlined by White House officials - would be insufficient. Speaking at the White House during a meeting with state governors on Monday morning, Mr Trump said: \"We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable.\" The president, who vowed to increase military spending and preserve welfare programmes during his campaign, said the budget will focus on \"military, safety, economic development\". \"It will include an historic increase in defence spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it,\" he said. Military spending has declined in recent years due to budgetary battles in Congress that led to a spending freeze on defence. However, it is still not uncommon for Congress to approve procurement of tanks, aircraft and ships that the Pentagon says it doesn't even need. Mr Trump's proposal would return the US closer to wartime spending. He also said he would spend \"big\" on infrastructure like roads and rails, but he has not yet revealed his tax plans. Mr Trump pledged to cut taxes during his presidential campaign, which would probably add to the national debt, a figure that could hit $20 trillion on his watch. Analysis - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America Reporter Keeping both of his campaign promises - boosting the military and protecting welfare - will put the president in a tough bind. If he wants to boost the defence budget by $54bn without adding to the deficit, that money will have to come from somewhere - and mandatory spending on welfare and debt interest takes nearly 70% of the budget off the table. Early reports are that the Environmental Protection Agency is facing sharp cuts, but its total annual budget is just over $8bn - a drop in the bucket. The State Department has also been singled out as a source for the needed funds, and its $50bn annually (including $22bn in direct aid) makes it a fatter target. The lion's share of humanitarian assistance goes to rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Aids treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, which will be difficult to touch. Also unlikely to get the axe is military support, dominated by $3.1bn annually to Israel. There's a reason the Trump administration announced the military budget number before revealing where the money will come from. Spending is easy; cutting is hard. The White House sent Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint, which begins on 1 October, to federal agencies on Monday. The agencies will then review the plan and propose changes to the cuts as the White House prepares for negotiations with Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending. Mr Trump's plan is expected to face backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over the planned cuts to domestic programmes. Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Mr Trump's plan is harmful to working families. \"We will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to hardworking American families and communities across the country,\" she said.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普提出上任后首份财政预算，计划将2018年的国防预算支出增加10%。"}

Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism for her response to the crisis. She said there had been no \"clearance operations\" for two weeks. In her speech in English to Myanmar's parliament, Aung San Suu Kyi said she felt \"deeply\" for the suffering of \"all people\" in the conflict, and that Myanmar was \"committed to a sustainable solution… for all communities in this state\". Ms Suu Kyi, who has decided not to attend the UN General Assembly in New York later this week, said she nevertheless wanted the international community to know what was being done by her government. Hours after her speech, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva called for full access to the region so it can investigate the situation \"with its own eyes\". What is the crisis about? Rakhine has faced unrest and sporadic violence for years, but the current crisis began in August with an armed attack on police posts which killed 12 people. That was blamed on a newly emerged militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa). The Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority, are denied citizenship and equal opportunities by the Myanmar government, which says they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They are largely despised by the wider Burmese majority-Buddhist population. The attack led to a massive security crackdown by the military, which the UN's human rights chief later said seemed like a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\". Rohingya Muslims started leaving in vast numbers, crossing into Bangladesh with tales of their villages being burned and saying they were facing persecution at the hands of the military. Thousands of Rohingya had already fled to Bangladesh in recent years. Access is restricted to the area, but on a government-controlled trip for journalists the BBC found reason to question the official narrative that Muslims were setting fire to their own villages. What did Suu Kyi say in her speech? The Myanmar government does not use the term Rohingya - calling the group Bengali Muslims instead - and Ms Suu Kyi did not do so in her speech. Delivering her address in a tone of measured defiance, she said she and her government \"condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence\". Among the key points: How was the speech received? Ms Suu Kyi has overwhelming support in her home country, where she was a political prisoner for years before coming to power. But her speech has been criticised internationally for failing to address the allegations of abuse by the military. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in neighbouring Bangladesh, disputed the claim that there had been no clearance operations since 5 September, pointing out that he had seen villages being burned days after that date. Amnesty International said Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was \"burying her head in the sand\" by ignoring the abuses by the army. \"At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming,\" the rights group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific, James Gomes, said in a statement. Blind to the realities? By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Nay Pyi Taw Aung San Suu Kyi is either completely out of touch or wilfully blind to the realities of what her army is up to. It is simply not credible to say we don't know why more than 400,000 Rohingya have fled. The evidence is being gathered every day in the testimony of refugees. There were other moments that raised eyebrows. Like when she presented as good news the fact that more than half the Muslims in Rakhine haven't fled. Or when she said that there had been no clashes in Rakhine for the last two weeks. To say as she did that \"all people in Rakhine state have access to education and healthcare without discrimination\" is simply wrong. The Rohingya, particularly those in camps around Sittwe, have long been denied access to the most basic services, in particular healthcare. What is Myanmar's position? While Ms Suu Kyi is the de facto head of the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, it is the military which holds real power in Rakhine state as it is in charge of internal security. The Burmese military says its operations in the northern Rakhine state are aimed at rooting out militants, and has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Ms Suu Kyi has previously said the narrative was being distorted by a \"huge iceberg of misinformation\" and said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorist.", "summary": "缅甸政府实际领导人、国务资政昂山素季发表讲话，回应外界对缅甸政府处理罗兴亚危机手法的质疑，表示她并不畏惧国际社会的“监督”。"}

India rejected the allegations and accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during the face-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region. Relations between the countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months. India said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had tried to approach a forward Indian position near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and \"fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate [our] own troops\". \"At no stage has the Indian army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,\" the statement from India's military said. The allegations of firing, if true, would be the first time in 45 years that shots had been fired there. A 1996 agreement between both countries bars the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known, although soldiers have clashed there before. According to Chinese state media outlet the Global Times, the Indian troops had \"illegally crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) into the Shenpao mountain region near the south bank of Pangong Tso Lake\", quoting senior colonel Zhang Shuili, a spokesperson of the PLA. India's move \"seriously violated related agreements reached by both sides, stirred up tensions in the region... and is very vile in nature\", said Mr Zhang. But India's statement added that the army was \"committed to maintaining peace\", adding that it was also \"determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs\". The PLA spokesperson also called on the Indian side to \"immediately stop dangerous moves, withdraw personnel who crossed the LAC... and punish the personnel who fired the provocative shot\". The tense confrontation comes just one day after India's military alerted Chinese officials of reports that five Indian civilians had been kidnapped by Chinese troops from an area near the disputed border. Indian cabinet minister KIren Rijiju tweeted on Tuesday that the PLA had responded to India's message. \"They have confirmed that the missing youths from Arunachal Pradesh have been found by their side,\" he said, adding that arrangements were being made to hand them over to Indian authorities. Tensions rose in June when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent skirmish with Chinese forces. Local media outlets said then that the soldiers had been \"beaten to death\". In August, India accused China of provoking military tensions at the border twice within one week. Both charges were denied by China, which said that the border standoff was \"entirely\" India's fault. The Line of Actual Control is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan valley and says China occupies 38,000sq km (14,700sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat.", "summary": "中印边界冲突继续升级，中国指责印度军队非法越过有争议的喜马拉雅山一处边界，并对中方巡逻士兵“鸣枪威胁”，但印度方面予以否认，并反指中国军队先鸣枪。"}

A recent survey from design company Sasaki asked people from six different US cities what they loved and hated about their urban environment. It revealed a passion for old buildings - 57% of those surveyed looked at old buildings when walking down the street, compared with 15% who admired skyscrapers. Only 17% wanted more shiny, iconic buildings. The BBC spoke to a series of architects and technologists about some of the more unusual buildings that might populate our future cities. None are quite what you might expect. The zoo where the humans are enclosed Bjarke Ingels has been commissioned to transform the Givskud Zoo in Denmark. He envisages some radical changes. This zoo, still at the concept stage, was based on a philosophy of having only social animals. A lot of people associate zoos with a lonesome tiger encaged in a small box, going nuts from boredom and claustrophobia., And I think when you have a social zoo, you can actually have a big group of animals living together in a habitat that resembles their normal habitat. That sounded like an interesting starting point because it means that as a visitor you'd find yourself way outnumbered by the animals and not the other way around. Zoos used to be really important for science and education, when people couldn't travel. Now you have film, television and inexpensive air fares that allow a lot of people to actually see animals for themselves. So part of the role of the zoo has disappeared. Hopefully, Zootopia can be a really exciting contribution to the zoo experience - maybe one that makes it more interactive. The zoo's ambition was to try to be a place where visitors don't notice the barriers between them and the animals. 'Pragmatic utopian' So you're at this tipping point between the feeling of intimacy and the need for safety and security. Some of the barriers we can incorporate in the water - for instance, by making sure that the boats stay on the side that is too deep for the animals to cross. There are all kinds of other landscape tricks to make various types of barriers. The main challenge, of course, is to really design the zoo in a way that the enclosure is still there, it's just not visible. We also want to eliminate all traces of man-made architecture - no round African huts or Chinese pagodas. Without this romantic, nostalgic, vernacular architecture, we can integrate the architecture into the landscape so that any blatant evidence of human presence is gone. Like camouflage. As architects, we create the framework for the life we want to live. As life evolves, so should our cities and buildings. And if they don't fit with the way we want to live our lives, it is not only possible but even our responsibility to make sure we change the city and make our physical world a bit more like our dreams. I call it the \"pragmatic utopian\" approach - the contrast between a practical approach to reality as it exists and the utopian idea of trying to achieve a perfect world at the same time. The house that wants to be liked Marc Kushner, co-founder of Architizer, an online catalogue of architectural projects, wants buildings that can be a bit more human. Buildings of the future will be smarter and more efficient. They will be controlled by our smartphones and built by drones and 3D printers - but none of that will matter unless the public falls in love with architecture, because only then will they appreciate and demand better buildings. When my architect firm won the MoMA/PS1 Young Architects Prize in 2012, we tried to create a building that elicited an emotional connection from people. We gave it a personality. We called her Wendy. Wendy, a summer installation, was a cantankerous character that was far from perfect. She leaked water from water misters, she was built from temporary scaffolding, her stairs were steep, and her giant fans blew out gusts of air (disturbing well coifed hipsters). It was in her imperfections that Wendy became loveable. Wendy would shoot out water from a water cannon, and then doused visitors would turn around and say: \"Oh, Wendy!\" They tweeted at her and Instagrammed with her. She was their summer pal. Wendy's massive surface area, over 5,000 sq ft (465 sq m), was coated with titanium nano-particles that essentially sucked pollution out of the air - activated by sunlight, when CO2 adhered to the surface and was washed away as a neutral element by rain water. Wendy's skin took the equivalent of 250 cars off the road. Advancing technology means that buildings can do nearly anything we ask them to do - like proactively create better air in our cities. We will build great cities when architects design sympathetic buildings that treat end-users like friends, rather than inert masses. Architects want the public to love their buildings, perhaps the first step is for their buildings to start loving those same people. Smart materials Michael Trousdell, an associate at consulting firm Arup, thinks the future will bring smarter materials and buildings that users can control. In the 1960s, construction of the Sydney Opera House was made possible by computer-powered structural design. Most buildings today are built out of computer-designed smart combinations of steel, cement and rock. As we make greater technological and socioeconomic advances, however, even smarter things are inevitable. Our recent adoption of smartphones embodies what we can expect - more control and more choice. The latest trends suggest smarter buildings will deliver more sophisticated user-control and \"healthier\" internal environments while also reducing environmental impact. Forward-thinking building owners, such as Google, are driving this next wave of innovation. The company's recently built office in Amsterdam is a great example - combining environmental aspirations (using non-toxic materials and prioritising energy and water saving in the design) with highly filtered fresh air throughout, including in the gym and other health-focused spaces such as a meditation room and restaurants. Material science, meanwhile, which provided the magic that is modern reinforced concrete, is also delivering high-functioning materials such as aerogel - a super-insulation that is translucent. This material is proposed to let light through the roof of the new Warner Stand at Lord's cricket ground, designed by Populous and Arup, while achieving a level of thermal insulation equivalent to an insulated wall, in just one-fifth the thickness. Also, material engineers are poised to deliver affordable and efficient electrical energy storage, the missing component of our renewable future. By combining this storage with internet controls, we can supply buildings with cheap, clean energy, generated outside of cities. This will allow our industry to meet increasingly diverse and expanding needs with less environmental impact. That is more than a smart building - it is a smart future for people and our planet.", "summary": "联合国一份报告称，全球70亿人口中有一半目前生活在城市地区，到2045年城市人口将超过60亿。"}

In the UK, the average age of menopause is 51. So what's behind the change? Hormones, specifically one called oestrogen. It is crucial to the whole monthly reproductive cycle - the development and release of an egg from the ovaries each month for fertilisation and the thickening of the lining of the womb ready to accept the fertilised egg. But as women age and their store of eggs declines, ovulation, periods and pregnancies stop. And the body gradually stops producing oestrogen, which controls the whole process. This doesn't happen overnight though. It can take several years for this crucial hormone to fall to low levels - and then it stays that way. What impact do hormone changes have? Massive ones. The brain, skin, muscles and emotions are all affected by falling levels of oestrogen. The body can start to behave very differently and many women experience symptoms long before their periods actually stop - during what is called the peri-menopause. Hot flushes, night sweats, sleep problems, anxiety, low mood and loss of interest in sex are common. Bladder problems and vaginal dryness are also normal during this time. When oestrogen production stops altogether, there is a long-term effect on the bones and heart. Bones can weaken, making fractures more likely, and women can become more vulnerable to heart disease and stroke. That's why women are offered hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which boosts oestrogen levels and helps to relieve symptoms. But not all women experience symptoms. They can also vary in their severity and how long they last - from a few months to several years. So what causes hot flushes? A lack of oestrogen. It is involved in the workings of the body's thermostat in the brain. Normally, the body copes well with temperature changes, but when oestrogen is lacking, the thermostat goes wonky and the brain thinks the body is overheating when it's not. Does oestrogen affect mood too? Yes, it can do. The hormone interacts with chemicals in brain receptors which control mood, and at low levels it can cause anxiety and low mood. A lack of oestrogen can also affect the skin, making it feel dry or as if insects are crawling under the skin. Are other hormones involved? Yes, progesterone and testosterone - but they don't have the same impact as low levels of oestrogen. Progesterone helps to prepare the body for pregnancy every month, and it declines when periods stop. Testosterone, which women produce in low levels, has been linked to sex drive and energy levels. It declines from the 30s onwards, and small numbers of women need it topped up. So how do you know if you're going through it? It is possible to take a blood test to measure levels of a hormone called FSH (follicle-stimulating hormones) but it's not very accurate, particularly over the age of 45. Experts say hormone levels go up and down all the time, even during the course of a day, so the test can't really pin down what's going on. A better way is to talk to a GP or nurse about the pattern of your periods and any symptoms you are experiencing. Knowing what symptoms to look out for is important - feeling low and irritable needs to be recognised as much as hot flushes and night sweats. A change in periods - becoming more heavy or more irregular - is one of the first signs of the menopause approaching. Until you are period-free for a year, you won't know you've actually gone through the menopause. What then? Well, oestrogen levels in the body don't recover after the menopause. With rising life expectancy, women are now living more than a third of their lives with oestrogen deficiency. But there is no reason to be cowed, says Dr Heather Currie, gynaecologist, menopause expert and past chairwoman of the British Menopause Society. \"Women are continuing to work later in life, they still look amazing - the image of the menopause is changing.\" Her advice: \"If you're affected, go and visit your GP surgery armed with information. \"Women should know what symptoms to look out for.\" She says there is plenty of support and information to help women cope with the physical and emotional changes which the menopause brings. Hormone replacement therapy is seen as the most effective treatment available for menopausal symptoms. There has been debate over its long-term safety, and it can cause some side-effects, but it has been shown that \"the benefits of HRT outweigh the risks\", Dr Currie says. Talking to other women going through the menopause and experiencing the same symptoms is also a real help, she adds. And the menopause is another good reason for women to lead a healthy lifestyle by: Doing these things will help to reduce the effects of the menopause on the body.", "summary": "绝经是指女性的月经停止，她们不能再自然怀孕，但身体的变化还会继续，又是为什么？"}

Meanwhile, Angela Merkel has warned about writing down any more Greek debt. Germany's chancellor said a so-called haircut of Greek debt would be bad for the stability of the eurozone, which has seen a return in investor confidence after years of worrying about the future of the single currency following bailouts of several nations - most recently, Cyprus. \"I am expressly warning against a haircut,\" Mrs Merkel said. \"It could trigger a domino effect of uncertainty with the result that the readiness of private investors to invest in the eurozone again falls to nothing.\" Her comments come after Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said - for the first time - earlier this month that Greece will need another bailout to plug a forthcoming funding gap. The issue of bailouts is a sensitive one in Germany, where Mrs Merkel faces elections for a third term on 22 September. Many Germans feel they have already contributed enough to European bailouts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last month estimated Greece would need around 11bn euros in 2014-15.

The meltdown at the Soviet plant was the worst nuclear disaster in history. An uncontrolled reaction blew the roof off, spewing out a cloud of radioactive material which drifted into other parts of the USSR, including Russia and Belarus, and northern Europe. Relatives of those who died attended candle-lit vigils at several churches, including at Slavutych, a town built to re-house workers who lived near the nuclear plant. A series of events are being held throughout the day. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko laid a wreath and observed a minute's silence in the Ukrainian capital Kiev before heading north for a ceremony at the plant itself, not far from the Belarussian border. \"We honour those who lost their health and require a special attention from the government and society,\" he said in a speech in Chernobyl. \"It's with an everlasting pain in our hearts that we remember those who lost their lives to fight nuclear death.\" He also said the nuclear disaster had been Ukraine's biggest challenge between the Nazi occupation in World War Two and the recent conflict in eastern Ukraine, which he described as \"Russian aggression\". \"At a time when we still need immense resources to tackle the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, when we need funding for social support to fire-fighters and victims, we have to spend almost one-fifth of our budget expenses on defence and security,\" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a message to the 600,000 people who helped in the clear-up - known as liquidators - called the nuclear disaster \"a grave lesson for all of mankind\". Etched in Ukraine's consciousness: analysis by Tom Burridge, Chernobyl Chernobyl is not a historical event in Ukraine but a living reality for an unquantifiable number of people. For the people who were evacuated after the disaster and separated from their families. For the estimated 180 residents who still live inside the 30km exclusion zone. For the army of workers who go there every day to continue work to secure the site, by constructing the giant shield-like structure which will be moved over reactor 4 later this year. Work to remove the radioactive contents of the reactor could take decades. Then there are those who died in the immediate aftermath of the accident. Their loved ones still mourn. And finally there is the highly contentious issue of how many people have died, or suffered illnesses, particularly cancers, because of exposure to high levels of radiation. That debate will probably never be resolved. The attempted cover-up by the Soviet authorities in 1986 further discredited rule by Moscow. And 30 years on, Chernobyl is etched into the consciousness of an independent Ukraine. Vasyl Markin, who had been working in Chernobyl at the time of the disaster, attended the midnight vigil in Slavutych. \"This tragedy will stay with us till the end of our lives,\" he said. \"I won't be able to forget it anyway.\" Some former residents returned to the area, now derelict and overgrown, ahead of the anniversary. Zoya Perevozchenko, 66, had lived in Pripyat, the town inhabited by Chernobyl workers which was abandoned in the wake of the accident. She told Reuters news agency: \"I barely found my apartment, I mean it's a forest now - trees growing through the pavement, on the roofs. All the rooms are empty, the glass is gone from the windows and everything's destroyed.\" Levels of radioactivity remain high in the surrounding area. A charity, Bridges to Belarus, is warning that a number of babies in a region close to Ukraine's border are still being born with serious deformities, while an unusually high rate of people have rare forms of cancer. Donors around the world pledged €87.5m (£68m; $99m) on Monday towards a new underground nuclear waste facility in the region. Ukraine will need to commit a further €10m in order to complete the new storage site. Work began in 2010 on a 25,000-tonne, €2.1bn sarcophagus to seal the uranium left in the damaged reactor, thought to be about 200 tonnes. Experts fear that if parts of the aging reactor collapse, further radioactive material could be spewed into the atmosphere. Ukrainian press remembers Chernobyl Newspapers in Ukraine carry sombre features looking back at the disaster and discussing ways of rehabilitating the exclusion zone. Segodnya carries a picture of the Chernobyl plant on its front page and highlights plans to create a nature reserve around it. Most of the area is \"clean\" now, it quotes the Ukrainian environment ministry as saying. Ukraina Moloda daily also says that the area has become \"safer\" and is now being promoted as a tourist attraction. Its front page headline recalls that \"The nuclear industry brought a lot of sorrow to Ukraine\". KP v Ukraine, a tabloid, calculates the disaster's cost and reaches the conclusion that money alone is not enough to estimate it. Mortality rates jumped by as much as 40% in certain parts of Ukraine, and many families were simply afraid to have children. \"The Chernobyl disaster has resulted in at least 50,000 children not being born,\" the paper says. The number of people killed by the disaster remains disputed. A report in 2005 by the UN-backed Chernobyl Forum concluded that fewer than 50 people had died as a result of exposure to radiation, most of them workers killed immediately after the disaster, but some survived until as late as 2004. The forum estimated up to 9,000 people could eventually die from radiation exposure, although Greenpeace claims the figure could be as high as 93,000.", "summary": "乌克兰周二（4月26日）展开切尔诺贝利核事故（台湾译车诺比）30周年纪念活动。"}

Labour has called for a personal apology from David Cameron. But Labour itself is accused of \"crying wolf\" over privatisation. The government said the report showed its plans for the future were right. The behind-the-scenes changes may not have been immediately apparent to patients in GP surgeries. But they were described by NHS leaders as \"so big you could see them from space\". The changes, which came into force in 2013, abolished large numbers of NHS organisations. Purse strings The aim was to shift the balance of power in the NHS to give GPs more say over the way budgets were spent. It provoked uproar in sections of the medical profession, in part over the role of potential privatisation of some services. King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham told the BBC: \"People in the NHS focused on rearranging the deckchairs rather than the core business of improving patient care. \"That's contributed to the increasing waiting times and declining performance that patients are experiencing.\" He described the reforms as simply \"disastrous\" and said that only in the past two years had the government got its focus right. However Andrew Lansley, who was the health secretary behind the changes, said patient care had been improved, and patients \"will continue to see the results\" of the reforms. 'Bewildering' During the reorganisation, all 151 primary care trusts - which provided services such as hospitals, dentists and opticians - and the 10 regional strategic health authorities were abolished. New bodies called clinical commissioning groups were set up locally. The report says: \"A set of policies designed to streamline and simplify the organisation of the NHS ended up having the opposite effect.\" It adds that the system is \"bewildering in its complexity\" and has left a \"strategic vacuum\" in some areas. The King's Fund says that in the past two years, the focus has rightly shifted to improving patient safety and quality of care as well as treating more people at home rather than in hospital. In a warning ahead of the election campaign the report said: \"If there is one clear message from the experience of the past five years, it is that politicians of all parties should be wary of ever again embarking on top-down restructuring of the NHS.\" There was also criticism of Labour, who, the King's Fund says, is \"crying wolf\" with \"ill-founded\" claims about the NHS being privatised. Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \"So now we know that every time patients wait longer for their test results, longer in A&E, longer to get an operation, the responsibility goes direct to David Cameron's door. \"And today he should personally apologise to the British people for having betrayed their trust, let them down and damaged our National Health Service.\" A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"We welcome the King's Fund's recognition that the government's focus on patient safety and integrated care is right for the NHS's future. \"This independent assessment also puts paid to Ed Miliband's myth that the reforms were about privatisation, and highlights why both the public and the health sector should be wary of Labour's plans for upheaval and reorganisation.\" Chaos Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association (BMA) said the changes were \"opposed by patients, the public and NHS staff, but politicians pushed through the changes regardless\". He added: \"This report highlights the damage that has been done to the health service and the major shortcomings of the Act, which distracted attention from rising pressure on services and cost billions to introduce. \"The damage done to the NHS has been profound and intense, but what is needed now is an honest and frank debate over how we can put right what has gone wrong without the need for another unnecessary and costly top-down reorganisation.\" But Mr Lansley said: \"The report is silent on the question of whether patient care has been improved, on which the evidence is clear. \"The NHS is now judged to be the best health service in the world. The number of administrators has fallen, doctors and nurses have risen, productivity has gone up, and waste has been cut by over £5bn a year. \"Public sector reform has never been a popularity contest, but these reforms will last.\"", "summary": "一项分析得出结论说，对英国国民健康服务NHS的大规模改革重组是“灾难性的”，对治病救人造成了“干扰”。"}

The UK -based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that it happened a month ago. IS took control of Palmyra in May, sparking fears for the site. It is considered one of the ancient world's most important cultural centres. The ancient city, which is a Unesco World Heritage site, is famed for its well-preserved Graeco-Roman ruins, and the Baalshamin temple, built nearly 2,000 years ago, is one of the city's best-known buildings. The Islamic State group has destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq. The militants believe any shrines or statues implying the existence of another deity are sacrilege and idolatry, and should be destroyed. IS \"placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baalshamin today [Sunday] and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple,\" Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdul Karim told AFP news agency. \"The cella (inner area of the temple) was destroyed and the columns around collapsed,\" he said. Emma Loosley, a professor at Exeter University who lived near the ancient city for three years, said the temple's cella was \"pretty much perfect\". \"I can't think of another temple as beautifully preserved as the temple of Baalshamin, and what was special about Palmyra was that it was a unique culture,\" she told the BBC. \"It had its own gods, its own form of art and architecture that you don't get anywhere else.\" Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra The Baalshamin temple is dedicated to the Phoenician god of storms and fertilising rains, and was almost completely intact. The oldest parts of the temple are thought to have dated from the year 17AD. Residents who had fled from Palmyra also said IS had planted explosives at the temple, although they had done it about one month ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last month, IS published photos of militants destroying what it said were artefacts looted at Palmyra. A week ago, it emerged that the archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades, Khaled al-Asaad, had been beheaded by the militant group. Mr Abdul Karim said the 81-year-old had refused to tell IS where some treasures had been hidden, in an effort to save them. The group has also published photos of what they said was the destruction of two Islamic shrines near Palmyra, which they described as \"manifestations of polytheism\". The modern city of Palmyra - known locally as Tadmur - is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the eastern city of Deir al-Zour.

So how does the law work and what are the penalties? What is the Official Secrets Act? The law was first created in 1911 and updated in 1989. A person can be guilty of an offence if they make a \"damaging disclosure of any information or document\" relating to security or intelligence of which they are in possession. The law is strictest for those working for the security and intelligence services, past and present. Any unauthorised disclosure - under any circumstances - is a criminal offence. But the rules are different for Crown servants (for example, civil servants, government ministers, the armed forces or police). In these cases, a person is only guilty of an offence if the leaked information falls into one of the following categories and is deemed \"damaging\". A person does not have to officially \"sign\" the Official Secrets Act to be bound by it. The 1989 Act states that a person can simply be \"notified\" that it applies to them. For example, it might be stated in a government employee's contract that the Act applies to them when they start work. Why aren't the police investigating? Following Mr Williamson's sacking, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, wrote to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, calling for a criminal investigation. Ms Dick says the Met will \"look at any complaint\", but adds the force has not received any referral from the Cabinet Office. The force says it needs a referral and to see material before it can decide whether to carry out an investigation. Whether or not a disclosure is deemed \"damaging\" is a decision for the attorney general. Any prosecution, under the 1989 Act, has to be done with their consent. If the police do decide to investigate, they would aim to determine the nature of the leaked information and who did it. But No 10 appears to want to draw a line under it. A spokesman said it \"considers the matter closed\". How often are people prosecuted? Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act are very rare - about one a year - according to the House of the Commons Library. But over the years, there have been some high-profile cases. In 1983, civil servant Sarah Tisdall gave documents to The Guardian which gave the arrival date of missiles to an RAF base. She was given a six-month sentence. In 2002, MI5 agent David Shayler was jailed for six months for giving information to the Mail on Sunday. In 2007, Scotland Yard civilian police worker Thomas Lund-Lack gave information to a Sunday Times journalist on planned al-Qaeda attacks in Great Britain and the West. His disclosure resulted in an eight-month sentence. The maximum penalty for an unauthorised disclosure under the Act is two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.

Speaking from a refugee camp in Syria, she said she was nine months pregnant and wanted to come home for her baby. She said she'd had two other children who had both died. She also described how one of her two school friends that had left the UK with her had died in a bombing. The fate of the third girl is unclear. 'It was like a normal life' Bethnal Green Academy pupils Ms Begum and Amira Abase were both 15, while Kadiza Sultana was 16, when they left the UK in February 2015. They flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later crossed the border into Syria. After arriving in Raqqa, she stayed at a house with other newly arrived brides-to-be, she told the Times. \"I applied to marry an English-speaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old,\" she said. Ten days later she married a 27-year-old Dutch man who had converted to Islam. She has been with him since then, and the couple escaped from Baghuz - the group's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a refugee camp in northern Syria. Asked by Times journalist Anthony Loyd whether her experiences of living in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her aspirations, Ms Begum said: \"Yes, it did. It was like a normal life. The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. \"Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that...\" She said that seeing her first \"severed head\" in a bin \"didn't faze me at all\". \"It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. \"I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance,\" she said. \"I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,\" she told Mr Loyd. \"I don't regret coming here.\" Will Shamima Begum be allowed to return to UK? Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's \"best interests\" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. Another British jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil, who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. But Ms Begum said the \"oppression\" had come as a \"shock\" and said she felt the IS \"caliphate\" was at an end. \"I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,\" she said. \"And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory.\" She referred to her husband having been held in a prison where men were tortured. A lawyer for the family of Kadiza Sultana said in 2016 that she was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike. Ms Begum told the Times her friend had died in a bombing on a house where there was \"some secret stuff going on\" underground. She added: \"I never thought it would happen. At first I was in denial. Because I always thought if we got killed, we'd get killed together.\" 'Scared this baby is going to get sick' Ms Begum said losing two children \"came as a shock. It just came out of nowhere, it was so hard\". Her first child, a girl, died at the age of one year and nine months, and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child - the first to die - died three months ago at the age of eight months, of an illness that was compounded by malnutrition, the Times reports. She told the paper she took him to a hospital. \"There were no drugs available, and not enough medical staff,\" she said. As a result she said she was \"really overprotective\" of her unborn child. She said this concern also contributed to her decision to leave Baghuz. \"I was weak,\" she said. \"I could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved. \"But I was also frightened that the child I am about to give birth to would die like my other children if I stayed on.\" She said she remained scared her unborn baby would become ill in the refugee camp. \"That's why I really want to get back to Britain because I know it will be taken care of - health-wise, at least,\" she said. She said she should be giving birth \"any day now\". \"I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child.\" Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who was instructed by the Bethnal Green girls' families after they ran away, said the families had told him they now wanted \"time and space to process what's happened\". Security minister Ben Wallace said he could not comment on Ms Begum's case for legal reasons but said any Britons who had gone to Syria to engage or support terrorist activities should be prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted if they came back to the UK. He said there was no consular assistance in Syria so any Briton wanting help would need to find consular services elsewhere in the region. Asked whether the government would be rushing to bring home people such as Ms Begum, he said: \"I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state.\" He added that while the UK had a duty of care to children of Britons in Syria, he also had a duty towards all UK citizens and would do what was \"proportionate and necessary\" to keep people safe. Sir Peter Fahy, a retired senior police chief who led the Prevent terrorism prevention programme at the time the girls ran away, said he could understand why the government was \"not particularly interested\" in facilitating her return. \"If the woman was showing complete remorse, it would be completely different,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It would cost a \"vast amount of money\" and the biggest challenge would be for local police to keep her safe and ensure she did not become a lightning rod for both right-wing extremists and Islamic extremists, he added. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent, said it should be remembered that Ms Begum was groomed as a child to become a radicalised woman and was a \"victim of brainwashing\". IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria.

President Trump campaigned on a pledge to cut taxes, and passing legislation would mark a significant victory. He appeared on Wednesday with several middle-class families he said would benefit from the overhaul in a final push for the tax plan. Mr Trump said he would like Congress to send him a bill by Christmas. Republicans in the the US House of Representatives and Senate agreed at a policy luncheon on a deal to merge their two tax proposals into one bill for Mr Trump to sign into law, according to US media reports. The 21% rate of corporate tax is above the 20% rate President Trump has previously called for. Reports suggest the reduction will come into effect in 2018, rather than in 2019 as the Senate version had proposed. Democrats argue that the tax cuts will favour only the rich, offer little to the middle class and add as much as $1.5 trillion to the $20tn national debt over 10 years. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office have both said wealthier taxpayers would benefit disproportionately from the cuts. Concerns have been raised by both Republicans and Democrats over the impact of the tax cuts on government borrowing. Final passage of the bill could still be difficult, but Republicans hope to hold a vote on the tax bill next week. However, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on Republicans to delay the vote until Alabama's next senator, Democrat Doug Jones, arrives in Washington. Mr Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore for Alabama's senate seat in a special election to replace US Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday. \"It would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote,\" Mr Schumer said. With Mr Jones in the Senate, Republicans will hold a razor thin 51-49 majority. Bringing the bill to a vote this month would allow Alabama Republican Senator Luther Strange, who was appointed to temporarily fill the vacant senate seat, a chance to vote on it.
