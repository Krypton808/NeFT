WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and is popular with people looking to avoid text messaging charges. In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as \"incredibly valuable\". WhatsApp allows users to send messages over internet connections, avoiding text messaging fees. The company claims it is currently registering one million new users a day. It makes money by charging users a subscription fee of $1 per year, although it offers a free model as well. Silicon Valley's newest billionaires The deal to buy it includes $4bn in cash and approximately $12bn-worth of Facebook shares, plus an additional $3bn in stock to WhatsApp's founders and employees at a later date. On a conference call to discuss the deal, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said he planned to operate the firm \"independently and autonomously\". He will also become a member of Facebook's board of directors. \"We're excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world,\" Mr Koum said in a statement. Mr Zuckerberg said the prospect of a deal was first floated just 11 days ago. The Facebook founder said he believed WhatsApp was on track to have a billion users, but insisted he had no plans to place advertising on WhatsApp's interface, saying he did not think ads were the best way to make money from messaging systems. Once the deal is finalised, Mr Koum and co-founder Brian Acton are set to become Silicon Valley's newest billionaires. WhatsApp has about 50 employees in total. Siphoning billions Cathy Boyle, a senior analyst at research firm eMarketer, said WhatsApp was valuable to Facebook for several reasons beyond advertising, including its younger user base and its popularity overseas. \"WhatsApp actually has greater penetration in a lot of international markets than Facebook,\" Ms Boyle told the BBC. She added that it was notable that Facebook's chief financial officer David Ebersman referred to the telecommunications industry when discussing the firm's purchase. \"WhatsApp is trying to siphon the billions that the telecom industry would make from [traditional SMS text messaging]\" she said. Ben Bajarin, from California-based technology consultants Creative Strategies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the deal would allow Facebook to tap into a rapidly growing market. \"WhatsApp is on a path towards a billion users,\" he said. \"They're growing exponentially - much, much faster than Facebook. \"For Facebook this is a key growth area where, even if they don't monetise this product, this is a way that Facebook can get the next billion smartphone consumers into their ecosystem... to touch them and engage with them in other ways than just the Facebook platform.\" Shares in Facebook dropped 5% in after hours trading before recovering slightly. Prior to this acquisition, Facebook's biggest purchase had been Instagram for $1bn in 2012. It had also reportedly offered $3bn to acquire photo messaging service Snapchat.", "summary": "脸书宣布以190亿美元价格购买智能手机社交应用WhatsApp，这是脸书历来最大收购。"}

Covid-19 is a new illness but it is caused by a coronavirus of the type first identified by Dr Almeida in 1964 at her laboratory in St Thomas's Hospital in London. The virologist was born June Hart in 1930 and grew up in a tenement near Alexandra Park in the north east of Glasgow. She left school with little formal education but got a job as a laboratory technician in histopathology at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Later she moved to London to further her career and in 1954 married Enriques Almeida, a Venezuelan artist. Common cold research The couple and their young daughter moved to Toronto in Canada and, according to medical writer George Winter, it was at the Ontario Cancer Institute that Dr Almeida developed her outstanding skills with an electron microscope. She pioneered a method which better visualised viruses by using antibodies to aggregate them. Mr Winter told Drivetime on BBC Radio Scotland her talents were recognised in the UK and she was lured back in 1964 to work at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London, the same hospital that treated Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was suffering from the Covid-19 virus. On her return, she began to collaborate with Dr David Tyrrell, who was running research at the common cold unit in Salisbury in Wiltshire. Mr Winter says Dr Tyrrell had been studying nasal washings from volunteers and his team had found that they were able to grow quite a few common cold-associated viruses but not all of them. One sample in particular, which became known as B814, was from the nasal washings of a pupil at a boarding school in Surrey in 1960. They found that they were able to transmit common cold symptoms to volunteers but they were unable to grow it in routine cell culture. However, volunteer studies demonstrated its growth in organ cultures and Dr Tyrrell wondered if it could be seen by an electron microscope. They sent samples to June Almeida who saw the virus particles in the specimens, which she described as like influenza viruses but not exactly the same. She identified what became known as the first human coronavirus. Mr Winter says that Dr Almeida had actually seen particles like this before while investigating mouse hepatitis and infectious bronchitis of chickens. However, he says her paper to a peer-reviewed journal was rejected \"because the referees said the images she produced were just bad pictures of influenza virus particles\". The new discovery from strain B814 was written up in the British Medical Journal in 1965 and the first photographs of what she had seen were published in the Journal of General Virology two years later. According to Mr Winter, it was Dr Tyrrell and Dr Almeida, along with Prof Tony Waterson, the man in charge at St Thomas's, who named it coronavirus because of the crown or halo surrounding it on the viral image. Dr Almeida later worked at the Postgraduate Medical School in London, where she was awarded a doctorate. She finished her career at the Wellcome Institute, where she was named on several patents in the field of imaging viruses. After leaving Wellcome, Dr Almeida become a yoga teacher but went back into virology in an advisory role in the late 1980s when she helped take novel pictures of the HIV virus. June Almeida died in 2007, at the age of 77. Now 13 years after her death she is finally getting recognition she deserves as a pioneer whose work speeded up understanding of the virus that is currently spreading throughout the world.", "summary": "最早识别出人类冠状病毒的人是一位女性，英国病毒学家、病毒成像专家琼·阿尔梅达（June Almeida）。她出生于苏格兰，父亲是当地一位巴士司机，她16岁中学毕业后即开始打工谋生。"}

Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being. So, how many are you guilty of? Myth 1 - You can cope on less than five hours' sleep This is the myth that just won't go away. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health. \"We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,\" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins. These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? Myth 2 - Alcohol before bed boosts your sleep The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. \"It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,\" said Dr Robbins. It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning. So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Myth 3 - Watching TV in bed helps you relax Have you ever thought \"I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV\"? Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep. Dr Robbins argues: \"Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news… it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax.\" And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Will the light from your phone kill you? Myth 4 - If you're struggling to sleep, stay in bed You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million). So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. \"We start to associate our bed with insomnia,\" said Dr Robbins. \"It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that… make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless.\" Her tip - go fold some socks. Myth 5 - Hitting the snooze button Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference? But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Dr Robbins said: \"Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze. \"Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep.\" Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Myth 6 - Snoring is always harmless Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. One of the warning signs is loud snoring. NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea Dr Robbins concludes: \"Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "谁都知道良好睡眠对健康的重要性。研究人员说，睡不好觉可以损害我们的健康、让我们情绪不佳，甚至还能减寿。"}

Oscar-winning Halle Berry had her second child at 47, three years ago, and John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston gave birth to her third child at 48. Geena Davis - best known for her role in Thelma and Louise - became a mother later in life after falling in love with an Iranian-American neurosurgeon in her 40s. Her first child, a girl, arrived when she was 46, followed two years later by twin boys. Then there was Swiss billionaire Maria Louis-Dreyfus, who gave birth to twin girls in March 2016, aged 53. But these mothers - and Jackson - are all positively young when compared to the world's oldest new mothers. In fact, there are at least three women in India who claimed to have carried their children to term when at least two decades older than the pop singer. Omkari Panwar, said to be 70, gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, in 2008. A few months later, Rajo Devi Lohan - also 70 - gave birth to a little girl, her first, much-longed for child. Daljinder Kaur, who may be as old as 72, although she claimed to be just 70, gave birth to a son in April 2016 after three attempts at IVF. Each time, the births caused a debate over the ethical issues surrounding having a baby so late in life - especially after Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, the Spanish woman who once held the title of the world's oldest mother, died three years after having twin boys.

Jozef Wesolowski is accused of sexually abusing children in the Dominican Republic from 2008 to 2013. He is under house arrest in the Vatican. The trial is to begin on 11 July. Wesolowski, 66, is also charged with possession of child pornography, dating from his return to Rome in 2013. Analysis: David Willey, BBC News, Rome Two years into his papacy Pope Francis is making good on his promise promptly to follow up allegations of sexual abuse and cover-up by his bishops. Two American bishops resigned only days after their diocese was accused by local prosecutors of turning a blind eye to sex crimes against children committed by one of their priests. Months and even years used to elapse between whistle-blowers denouncing paedophile priests and reaction from the Vatican. Now Pope Francis acts within days. Jozef Wesolowski, a former archbishop who used to be a Vatican diplomat, is the highest ranking Vatican official ever to stand accused of sex crimes and keeping child pornography on his computer. Pope Francis has created a special new Vatican tribunal to try bishops accused of covering up sex crimes. But it still remains to be seen how effective this measure will be. The moves are seen as part of a crackdown by Pope Francis on clerics and employees of the Church who exploit minors. Last year, the Pope compared the actions of those who commit such crimes to a \"satanic mass\". He also strengthened the Vatican's laws against child abuse. Wesolowski, who is originally from Poland, was recalled from the Dominican Republic in 2013, after allegations surfaced accusing him of abusing Dominican boys. He had spent five years in the Caribbean country as the papal envoy. He was defrocked in June last year after he was found guilty by a Church tribunal - he is the highest-ranking church official to be defrocked for such abuse. He will now be tried by a Vatican criminal court. A Vatican statement said the IT systems used by Wesolowski would be scrutinised. He has been under house arrest in the Vatican since September. The Vatican said at the time of his arrest that he had not been placed in a police cell because of his poor health. If found guilty, he could face between six and 10 years in prison. US resignations The Vatican also accepted the resignations of an archbishop in the United States and his deputy following accusations that their archdiocese covered up the sexual abuse of children. They are Archbishop John Nienstedt and Auxiliary Bishop Lee Anthony Piche from the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. John Nienstedt said in a statement that his leadership had drawn attention away from the good works of the church but stressed he was leaving \"with a clear conscience\". Their resignation comes after prosecutors charged their archdiocese with \"turning a blind eye\" to repeated reports of inappropriate behaviour by a priest who was later convicted of molesting two boys. Neither man was named in the indictment. Prosecutors accuse the archdiocese of failing to respond to \"numerous and repeated reports of troubling conduct\" by Curtis Wehmeyer, a former priest currently serving a five-year prison sentence for molesting two boys.", "summary": "梵蒂冈将在7月11日开庭审理前驻多米尼加共和国大使约瑟夫·韦索沃夫斯基性侵犯儿童案。"}

But activists claimed on Tuesday that an online campaign had persuaded the state to give her a 10-day reprieve. The human rights group Amnesty International said she was convicted after a deeply flawed investigation. Ms Jabbari was arrested in 2007 for the murder of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence. She was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she reportedly did not have access to a lawyer or her family, and was sentenced to death by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009. Amnesty said that although Ms Jabbari admitted to stabbing Mr Abdolali Sarbandi once in the back, she alleged that there was someone else in the house who actually killed him. Her claim is believed to have never been properly investigated. Protest The authorities appeared to be pressing ahead with the execution on Monday, when they confirmed that Ms Jabbari had been transferred to Rajaishahr prison and would be hanged. A campaign calling for a halt to the execution was launched on Facebook and Twitter, using the hashtag #SaveReyhanehJabbari. Photographs of a protest outside the prison were also posted. On Tuesday, activists and bloggers reported that Ms Jabbari's execution appeared to have been postponed so that Mr Abdolali Sarbandi's family could be consulted. They cited a letter reportedly written by Ms Jabbari's mother, Sholeh Pakravanin, thanking people for their support and efforts to save her daughter's life. The development comes after activists said a former psychologist had been executed for \"corruption on Earth and heresy in religion\" near the city of Karaj on Wednesday. Mohsen Amir Aslani, 37, was arrested nine years ago after giving religious classes in which he provided his own interpretations of the Koran, they said. He was subsequently accused by the authorities of insulting the Prophet Jonah, the activists added. Iran's judiciary has denied that Mr Amir Aslani's execution was linked to his religious beliefs.

The Queen and I: 63 anecdotes and photos of your encounters Young Queens VICTORIA became Queen aged 18 and remained on the throne for 23,226 days, or 63 years, seven months and two days. ELIZABETH assumed the throne aged 25 and will become Britain's longest reigning monarch on 9 September 2015. A member of the German House of Hanover, VICTORIA, who stood 4ft 11in (1.5 metres), was the last of the Hanoverian monarchs. She had nine children- four of whom became sovereigns or married sovereigns. ELIZABETH, who is 5ft 4ins (1.6 metres), is a descendant of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which was renamed the House of Windsor during World War One. Elizabeth and Prince Philip have four children. Becoming Queen Some 400,000 people gathered in London for VICTORIA's coronation. An estimated 27 million people in Britain watched ELIZABETH's coronation on TV and 11 million listened on the radio. Happily married VICTORIA married Prince Albert on 10 February 1840 aged 21. They were married for 20 years, before he died in December 1861. ELIZABETH married the Duke of Edinburgh on 20 November 1947, also aged 21. They have been married for nearly 68 years. She is the first reigning British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary. State of the nation When VICTORIA assumed the throne in 1837 - the population of England, Scotland and Wales was 16 million. She died on 22 January, 1901, when there were 32.5 million people living in England and Wales. ELIZABETH took the throne in 1952 with the UK population at 50 million. At her Diamond Jubilee, in 2012, it had increased to 63.2 million. Growth and decline VICTORIA oversaw an empire, measuring a quarter of the globe, and some 400 million people. ELIZABETH is head of state of the UK and 15 Commonwealth realms, with a combined population of about 139 million. Official visits VICTORIA made her first official visit to Ireland in 1849. ELIZABETH has visited 116 countries on official trips, covering 43,618 miles in her coronation tour, in 1953. Wealthy women VICTORIA was given £385,000 a year by Parliament after taking the throne, later buying Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, and Balmoral Castle. ELIZABETH is estimated to be worth £340m. Prime ministers VICTORIA's reign included 10 UK prime ministers. She outlived all but two. William Gladstone was prime minister on no less than four occasions during her monarchy. ELIZABETH has overseen 12 prime ministers. Margaret Thatcher was the longest-serving - for more than 11 years. Coins in circulation During VICTORIA's reign, some 2.5 billion coins were produced by the Royal Mint. Since ELIZABETH's coronation, 68 billion coins have been produced (8.1 billion pre-decimal coins and 60.3 billion decimal coins). Popes and archbishops VICTORIA's reign oversaw six Archbishops of Canterbury and three popes. ELIZABETH's has included seven archbishops and seven popes. Streets There are 153 roads named after VICTORIA in the UK. There are 237 named after ELIZABETH. Under threat? There were seven attempts to kill or assault VICTORIA during her lifetime. A teenager was arrested in 1981 for firing six blank cartridges at ELIZABETH as she rode on horseback before the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

Revelations of an alleged programme to tap into servers of nine internet firms were \"reprehensible\", he said. Internet firms deny giving government agents access to their servers. The director of US national intelligence said he wanted to reassure Americans that the intelligence community was committed to respecting their civil liberties and privacy. He issued a strong-worded statement late on Thursday, after the UK's Guardian newspaper said a secret court order had required phone company Verizon to hand over its records to the National Security Agency (NSA) on an \"ongoing daily basis\". That report was followed by revelations in both the Washington Post and Guardian that US agencies tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms to track people in a programme known as Prism. The reports about Prism will raise fresh questions about how far the US government should encroach on citizens' privacy in the interests of national security. The NSA confirmed that it had been secretly collecting millions of phone records. But Mr Clapper said the \"unauthorized disclosure... threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation\". The article omitted \"key information\" about the use of the records \"to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties\". He said reports about Prism contained \"numerous inaccuracies\". While admitting the government collected communications from internet firms, he said the policy only targets \"non-US persons\". 'Variety of threats' Prism was reportedly developed in 2007 out of a programme of domestic surveillance without warrants that was set up by President George W Bush after the 9/11 attacks. Prism reportedly does not collect user data, but is able to pull out material that matches a set of search terms. Mr Clapper said the communications-collection programme was \"designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-US persons located outside the United States\". \"It cannot be used to intentionally target any US citizen, any other US person, or anyone located within the United States,\" he added. Mr Clapper said the programme, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was recently reauthorised by Congress after hearings and debate. \"Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,\" he added. But while US citizens were not intended to be the targets of surveillance, the Washington Post says large quantities of content from Americans are nevertheless screened in order to track or learn more about the target. The data gathered through Prism has grown to become a major contributor to the president's daily briefing and accounts for almost one in seven intelligence reports, it adds. The Washington Post named the nine companies participating in the programme as Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple. Microsoft said in a statement to the BBC that it only turned over customer data when given a legally binding order, and only complied with orders for specific accounts. \"If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it,\" Microsoft said. Meanwhile, Yahoo, Apple and Facebook said they did not give the government direct access to their servers. In a statement, Google said: \"Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data.\" On Wednesday, it emerged that the NSA was collecting the phone records of tens of millions of Americans, after the Guardian published a secret order for the Verizon phone company to hand over its records. A senior congressman, House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers, told reporters that collecting Americans' phone records was legal, authorised by Congress and had not been abused by the Obama administration. He also said it had prevented a \"significant\" attack on the US \"within the past few years\", but declined to offer more information. The order requires Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to disclose to the NSA the metadata of all calls it processes, both domestic and international, in which at least one party is in the US. Such metadata includes telephone numbers, calling card numbers, the serial numbers of phones used and the time and duration of calls. It does not include the content of a call or the callers' addresses or financial information. As surveillance practices come under scrutiny in the US, a new system to monitor phone and internet connections in India is being criticised as \"chilling\" by New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW). The Central Monitoring System (CMS) enables authorities to follow all online activities, phone calls text messages and social media conversations. The Indian government said in December 2012 the system would \"lawfully intercept internet and telephone services\". But HRW says the system by-passes service providers in a country that has no privacy law to protect people from arbitrary intrusions. In the UK on Wednesday, a committee of MPs criticised a decision to allow Chinese firms such as Huawei to become embedded in British network infrastructure without the knowledge and scrutiny of ministers. Huawei - which denies close ties with the Chinese state - signed a 2005 telecoms deal with BT to supply equipment for a £10bn major network upgrade.", "summary": "美国前国家情报总监詹姆斯·克拉珀（James Clapper）周日（3月5日）对媒体表示，美国情报机构从未对特朗普及其竞选团队进行过窃听。"}

Our guard commander replied that the suppers had not been sent down from the cookhouse. \"His Royal Highness picked up the duty telephone and told whoever he was speaking to, to get their lazy arses down to the guard room ASAP with warm food and more warm drinks as the Royal Guard were freezing their butts off. \"He then bid us good night and, hands behind his back, marched out of the guardroom.\" A few minutes went by before a \"very disgruntled\" chef staggered in clutching a tray of warm food. \"We tucked into the food and had a great laugh.

Mr Musk, the first to testify at the court, said Mr Unsworth had insulted him, so he had insulted him back. The 48-year-old said the \"pedo guy\" tweet had not been meant to be taken literally. Mr Unsworth's legal team have described Mr Musk's now-deleted tweet as \"vile and false\" and are seeking unspecified punitive damages. The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire posted the message after Mr Unsworth publicly rejected his proposal to use a mini-submarine to rescue the boys, members of a football team who became trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand in June 2018 in a case that captured the world's attention. But in an interview on CNN after the successful rescue, Mr Unsworth called the idea a \"PR stunt\" and suggested the American \"stick his submarine where it hurts\". Two days later, Mr Musk wrote a series of tweets including one describing Mr Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\". In his court testimony, Mr Musk - who has 29.8 million Twitter followers - said Mr Unsworth's comments were \"wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back\", adding: \"It was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.\" He said he had thought Mr Unsworth \"was just some random creepy guy\" and \"unrelated to the rescue\", and that he had not expected the tweet to be taken literally. \"I assume he didn't mean to sodomise me with a submarine... Just as I didn't literally mean he was a paedophile.\" The Tesla boss apologised to the cave diver in court, looking directly at him and saying: \"I apologised in a tweet and again in the deposition, and I'll say it again: I apologise to Mr Unsworth.\" Mr Unsworth did not testify on Tuesday. Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in his opening statements that the term \"pedo guy\" was a common insult in South Africa, where the billionaire grew up, meaning \"creepy old man\", and described the messages as \"joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men\". But Lin Wood, a lawyer for Mr Unsworth, tried to show that Mr Musk had meant what he said by citing a separate tweet in which Mr Musk, after being questioned about the allegation by other users, said, \"Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.\" That tweet was also later deleted. Then, in an email exchange with a Buzzfeed reporter who had contacted him for comments on a threat of a legal case by Mr Unsworth, Mr Musk said, \"Stop defending child rapists.\" In the packed courtroom, Mr Musk also acknowledged paying $52,000 (£40,000) to a man who had posed as a private detective to dig up information on Mr Unsworth after it became clear he would be sued. The investigator turned out to be a conman, Mr Musk said. Mr Musk's comments on Twitter have been controversial on other occasions and in April he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his tweets, which also puts a restriction on his use of the platform. The judge has denied the defence's request to define Mr Unsworth as a \"public figure\" - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with \"actual malice\", lowering the bar necessary to win the case.", "summary": "一名英国洞穴潜水员近日对科技界富豪、特斯拉创始人伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）提起诉讼，指马斯克恶意诽谤。"}

The Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry will also be there. However, the Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from official duty, will not be attending. Ms Markle and the prince will marry at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle at midday on 19 May.

The parade is being scrutinised for clues about North Korea's weapons arsenal and professed commitment to denuclearisation. Some analysts had predicted that Mr Kim would tone down the display after his summit with US President Donald Trump. A large display of ICBMs - which can reach the US mainland, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead - would have been seen as provocative. In June Mr Kim and Mr Trump signed a vague agreement to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but it did not include a timeline, details or mechanisms to verify the process. High-level talks and visits have continued but the most recent scheduled trip by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was called off last minute and both sides have blamed each other for the stalling negotiations while insisting they're committed to the progress. The BBC's Seoul Correspondent Laura Bicker said any show of ICBMs could have put future discussions and any deal to declare an end to the Korean war at risk. North Korea was also due to hold its first mass games in five years. The Arirang Mass Games are an elaborate propaganda spectacle with enormous co-ordinated displays. This year's games, which tell a symbolic story of North Korea's history, are titled The Glorious Country. Analysis of satellite images from the past two weeks suggest this year's games, which will continue throughout September, are going to be very big.

And PJ Harvey's Let England Shake won the album award, beating Adele's 21 and Kate Bush's 50 Words For Snow. The annual awards - in their 57th year - are highly regarded within the industry because they are voted for by songwriters and composers.

She said: \"The main thing was the songs weren't as good as my voice, and I took that on board and now I'm winning songwriter of the year.\" Eurythmics singer Lennox said she had been struck by Adele's talent when they had performed on Later With Jools Holland. \"It was like lightning had struck,\" said Lennox. \"She doesn't need talent shows and competitions and hype - this is the real deal.\" In the category for most performed song, Adele had two of the three nominations - for Rolling in the Deep and Someone Like You - with the shortlist completed by Take That's The Flood. Accepting the award for Rolling in the Deep, with co-writer Paul Epworth, Adele joked that she never expected it to be a hit. \"No offence Paul, I didn't think it was going to do anything, anywhere!\" But the song has helped the north London singer become the world's biggest pop star, with global sales of 18 million for her second album 21. The album was pipped to the Ivors' best album prize by singer-songwriter PJ Harvey, who also beat Adele to the Mercury Music Prize last September.

It compares with \"Cyber Monday\" in the US, the Monday after Thanksgiving, which is also marketed as a big online shopping day. \"You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer,\" said Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman, Joe Tsai. \"We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy from focused on the state sector to consumption.\" Growing market Alibaba had said it expected to break sales records during the annual event, offering big discounts to boost sales. \"I bet the number [of goods bought] is going to be scary,\" said Alibaba's executive chairman Jack Ma last week. He estimated that 200 million packages would be shipped from orders made during the day. The company, which recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, surpassed that number by 18:00 Beijing time. Analysis: Celia Hatton, Beijing correspondent, BBC News. When did an obscure holiday devoted to single people, a kind of anti-Valentine's Day, become China's biggest shopping day of the year? Many in China find the transition baffling. \"November 11 used to be 'Singles' Day'. Then it became the Shopping Day, and now it's Couples' Shopping Day,\" complains one user on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. \"Looking across the globe and over the years, there's never really been a day dedicated to single people.\" Others point out that China's biggest online shopping platform, Alibaba, engineered the change. Alibaba trademarked the term \"Double-11\", a popular term describing the November 11th holiday, in 2012. The website earns a significant chunk of its profits on that day. \"They say behind every successful man, there's a woman quietly supporting him. Behind Jack Ma, [Alibaba's founder], there're tens of millions of female shopaholics,\" jokes one Weibo user. Frustration lingered in the background of many Weibo forums. Shoppers complained the online deals were too good, tempting them to spend money they didn't have. \"Please Singles' Day, can you pass by quickly?,\" reads a typical comment. \"I didn't think I needed anything until today when I feel like I need everything I see. I'm so helpless!\" Singles' Day in China was adopted by Alibaba in 2009 to boost sales, but dates back to at least 1993, when students at Nanjing University are believed to have chosen the date as an anti-Valentine's Day where single people could buy things for themselves. Since then, it has gone on to become a massive day of sales for China's fast growing e-commerce market. The market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 25% over the next few years, from $390bn in 2014 to $718bn in 2017, according to a recent study released by management consulting firm AT Kearney. This year's Singles' Day online sales event has attracted the participation of more than 27,000 global brands, including Japanese label Muji, Spanish clothing retailer Desigual and American outdoor clothing label The North Face. Challenges? \"Lots of clients from the brands side have for the first time, approached the Singles' Day as an event on its own, and earmarked it as a significant retail operation, as major as Christmas and the Chinese New Year,\" said Shaun Rein from China Market Research in Shanghai. However, despite Alibaba's recent successful share sale and the strong performance of this year's Singles' Day, Mr Rein says Alibaba still faces challenges. He notes that while 35% of e-commerce transactions in China come from mobile devices, Alibaba is lagging slightly behind, with 31% of its sales generated from mobiles.", "summary": "中国消费者在星期三（11月11日）“光棍节”掀起网上购物狂潮，阿里巴巴公司声称全天交易额达到912.17亿人民币元，同比增长59.7%。"}

Pro-Russian forces took control of Crimea in February. They moved in after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after street protests. Mr Putin and US President Barack Obama spoke over the phone earlier, with the Kremlin and the White House later releasing contrasting accounts of the conversation. The Kremlin said both men agreed to seek a way to stabilise Ukraine, and that Mr Putin had stressed that the Kiev government had failed to curb \"rampant violence by ultra-nationalists\". The White House said Mr Obama had insisted that the referendum was illegal and would never be accepted, and called for Moscow to support an international monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine. The EU said in a statement that the vote was \"illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised\". EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday and are expected to consider imposing sanctions on Russian officials. Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea's leader installed last month after the Russian takeover, celebrated the referendum on stage in Simferopol. Backed by the Russian national anthem, Russian flags, and the personnel of Russia's Black Sea fleet, he told supporters that Crimea was \"going home\". Mr Aksyonov said Crimea's parliament, which was disbanded by the government in Kiev last week, would send a formal request to Moscow to join Russia on Monday. Some 58% of people in Crimea are ethnic Russian, with the rest made up of Ukrainians and Tatars. Most of the Tatars that the BBC spoke to said they had boycotted the vote, and felt that life under the Kremlin would be worse. Refat Chubarov, leader of the Tatars' unofficial parliament, said the referendum was illegal, and held in a hasty manner under the control of Russian troops. \"The fate of our motherland cannot be decided in such a referendum under the shadows of the guns of soldiers,\" he told the BBC. The Tatars were deported to Central Asia by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. They were only able to return with the fall of the Soviet Union and many want to remain in Ukraine. But the referendum did not have an option for those who wanted the constitutional arrangements to remain unchanged. Voters were asked whether they wanted to join Russia, or have greater autonomy within Ukraine. Away from the Crimea region, unrest continued in the south-east Ukrainian city of Donetsk.

Mr Dao was left bloodied after law enforcement officials dragged him off the plane as he refused to leave. The footage provoked international outrage and the Dao family issued a statement on Tuesday evening expressing gratitude for the \"outpouring of support\". \"This can never, will never happen again on a United Airlines flight,\" said Mr Munoz in Wednesday morning's television interview. He was asked what the company would do in future if a seated passenger refused voluntarily to leave an overbooked plane based on the airline's compensation offer. \"We're not going to put a law enforcement official to take them off,\" he said. \"To remove a booked, paid seated passenger, we can't do that.\" Mr Munoz was asked if Mr Dao, who has been undergoing treatment at a Chicago hospital, was at fault. The chief executive paused. He said: \"No. He can't be. He was a paying passenger sitting on our seat in our aircraft and no one should be treated that way.

A Belgian man of Moroccan descent, Ahmad Dahmani, 26, has been arrested at a luxury hotel in Antalya along with two other terror suspects, Turkish authorities have told the BBC. He is believed to have been in contact with the suspects who perpetrated the Paris attacks, an official said. He arrived from Amsterdam on 14 November; there is no record of the Belgian authorities having warned Turkey about him, which is why there was no entry ban, the official said. The Belgian authorities have so far charged three people with involvement in the attacks, claimed by Islamic State militants. In Paris, French police have freed seven people arrested during the massive raid on an apartment housing the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, prosecutors said according to AFP news agency. Abdelhamid Abaaoud was killed in the raid in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, Jawad Bendaoud - who has admitted lending the apartment to two people from Belgium \"as a favour\", but denied knowing any more - is being held in custody. More on the Paris attacks Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath Earlier, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to \"redouble\" action against Islamic State following last week's deadly attacks in the French capital. The French-drafted document urges UN members to \"take all necessary measures\" in the fight against IS, which said it carried out the attacks. France is still hunting Salah Abdeslam, who hired one of the cars used in the attacks. French media have reported that nine militants carried out the attacks, and seven died on Friday night. So it is possible that another attacker - as well as Salah Abdeslam - is still at large. Investigators suspect the gunmen used safe houses in Saint-Denis, Bobigny and Alfortville in the Paris region. But it is not clear when the group met up to launch the attacks. Other elements of the plot also remain unclear. Investigators will be studying phone records and assessing the weapons seized for further clues. Hundreds of people were wounded in the near-simultaneous attacks on Paris bars and restaurants, a concert hall and sports stadium. The attacks were the worst in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings. What is Islamic State? IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. What does it want? IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death. How strong is IS? IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multi-national coalition, which has vowed to destroy it.

The 30-year-old was found hiding in a neighbour's cupboard while a lion cub sat on a nearby bed. Police found another lion cub in a flat in the city last year and, earlier this month, a jogger in the Netherlands came across one abandoned in a cage in a field. So what is going on? The BBC asked experts in the wildlife trade about these finds. Where do the cubs come from? Lion cubs being kept illegally in Europe are unlikely to have been born in the wild, officials say. \"There is a good chance they were born in captivity in Europe,\" says Lois Lelanchon, an expert in the illegal wildlife trade from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. \"They could be from private owners, irresponsible breeders, non-accredited zoos, and unscrupulous circuses,\" he says. Mr Lelanchon explains that it would be very risky to try and smuggle in an exotic animal from Africa or Asia because the trade is well-regulated and customs officers are well-trained. But it is not impossible, and some people have attempted to sneak through airport security with a big cat in the past. Richard Thomas, from the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, agrees that the recently discovered lions are \"almost certainly captive-bred\" but does not completely rule out that they may have been smuggled in from abroad. \"It's a question of evading detection and seizure by whatever means the smuggler can,\" he says, \"whether it's simply the animal being overlooked or a case of an official being encouraged to turn a blind eye.\" Who is buying them? People with a fair amount of disposable income. The suspect in Paris this week reportedly tried to sell the animal for €10,000 ($11,470; £8,835) on social media. \"It's likely to be someone who thinks owning one gives them a sense of power and invincibility,\" says Dr Thomas. \"Some owners are either rich and powerful and consider themselves above the law or are senior figures in the criminal underworld,\" he adds. This appeared to be the case when, in 2009, Italian police seized a crocodile they said belonged to a suspected mafia boss. Dr Thomas suggests the film industry could play a part in the glamorisation of exotic animals. \"Think Al Pacino with his pet tiger in Scarface or the bad guy in the film Skyfall with his Komodo dragon,\" he says. But Mr Lelanchon says straightforward ignorance is another reason why people buy big cat cubs. \"People who think lion cubs are very pretty, exotic, cool, and different [buy them],\" he says. \"But they don't take into account the animal welfare and safety considerations that owning a lion entails.\" You may also be interested in: Why is it a bad idea? Well, they are dangerous wild animals, for a start. \"Unlike dogs, such animals haven't been tamed by centuries of domestic breeding,\" says Dr Thomas. \"It's very unlikely they'll grow up to be tame, even if raised by humans from an early age.\" \"Wild animals remain wild and they can be dangerous,\" says Mr Lelanchon. \"They can put their owners and other people around them in danger, especially if they escape.\" And they can escape. In 2011, police in the US state of Ohio shot and killed a number of bears, wolves, tigers and lions after they were released from their enclosures at a private zoo. Another factor to consider is the wellbeing and complex needs of a big cat. \"Most private owners cannot provide the right welfare for these animals,\" says Mr Lelanchon. \"Lions don't eat dog food, obviously, and they need a lot of land to exercise.\" \"It's not a very happy ending for most of them,\" he adds. What happens when they are found? Owners are likely to dispose of a big cat when it grows and becomes unmanageable, says Dr Thomas. He points to the recent example in the Netherlands and says this is probably what happened there. Alternatively, the animal may be voluntarily surrendered to the authorities but Mr Lelanchon says this is less common because the owner will almost certainly face criminal charges. If the police do find a cub, then the main priority is to check its wellbeing. \"When it is confiscated, it is given a health check by a vet to assess the state of the animal and to look for potential evidence of cruelty,\" Mr Lelanchon says. \"If it's in good shape, then the next step is to look for a placement facility,\" he explains. \"That could be a wildlife centre, a zoo, or a sanctuary.\" If a suitable facility is found, then the animal can then be rehomed. This is what happened to the emaciated lion cub that was found in an empty flat in Paris last year. It was rehomed in an animal reserve in South Africa by wildlife officials. So, in that instance at least, there was a happy ending to the story.", "summary": "在不寻常的地方发现因不寻常的缘由躲藏起来的人，是警察习以为常的事情。"}

Australia has reported just over 7,400 cases, far fewer than many nations. It has seen 102 deaths - the last was a month ago. Since May, the country has entered a phased exit from lockdown restrictions as the curve flattened. But in the last week there's been a rise in cases in Victoria, mostly in the state capital Melbourne. Concern has crept back into public conversation: Is this a small setback, or could it be something more sustained? What's happened in Victoria? On 13 June, Australia's chief medical officer Dr Brendan Murphy noted that community transmission appeared to only be present in Victoria, the second-most populous state. He said the virus had been effectively eliminated in many parts of the country. Even the most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), which includes Sydney, had not reported a local transmission in weeks. That remains the case. But Victoria's situation has worsened since then - an average 18 new infections were reported each day last week. About half are thought to involve clusters, particularly transmissions between family members and quarantine staff. Prof Brett Sutton, Victoria's chief health officer, said the state had seen \"very low\" levels of community transmission since February, but this was now \"re-emerging because people are not doing things as stringently as they might have done a month, two months ago.\" How bad are the numbers? This is the greatest increase Australia has seen in two months, but it remains well short of the peak in March. There are now over 100 active cases in Victoria, mainly contracted in the past fortnight. But in late March there were over 100 new cases being reported every day. At that time, several hundred people with the virus were in hospital across the country, and daily infections were climbing by about 25%. On Monday, that rate was at 0.4% and there were nine people being treated in Victoria's well-prepared hospitals. Testing is also rigorous, widespread and accessible to anyone with even mild symptoms. Australia's numbers continue to sit well below many nations. Globally, about 183,000 new global cases were reported in the 24 hours to Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The US has seen the most deaths - more than 120,000 - followed by Brazil, which has exceeded 50,000. How are Australian authorities responding? The Victorian government has brought back tougher restrictions and extended a state of emergency until 12 July. They have also zeroed in on six suburban \"hotspots\" - all in Melbourne. Fifty-person medical teams have been dispatched to expand testing and trace over 1,000 contacts of patients. If numbers increase, residents may face localised stay-at-home orders again. Health officials blamed much of the problem on family gatherings, allowed since April, where \"hugging and kissing\" had occurred against advice. Victoria has now reduced a 20-person limit in households to five, and delayed further easing restrictions for pubs and restaurants. The Australian Football League (AFL) called off one match after a player tested positive on the weekend. Despite concerns that a Black Lives Matter rally held in the city two weeks ago could contribute to the increase, health officials have said there's no evidence that new cases were acquired there. How is the rest of Australia responding? Other states have reported very few, if any, cases in the past month. Many had already expressed reluctance about opening their borders to Victoria and NSW, which have seen the most infections. The latest spike is likely to lead to further delays, some premiers have signalled. On Monday, NSW told its residents to reconsider travelling to hotspots in Victoria. While Victoria's cases make up a quarter of the national total, NSW has closer to a third. When asked by reporters why local transmission had not been a greater problem there, Dr Murphy suggested it was \"good luck\". How great is a 'second wave' risk? When restrictions were first eased in May, health officials warned it would be almost impossible to avoid having some further outbreaks. They say they are confident they can prevent a second wave if they can get on top of clusters quickly. Australia's success has consistently been attributed to its strong public health response. It remains in an enviable position of being able to target outbreaks while they're still relatively confined and small in number. \"It's still too early to say how the Victorian outbreaks are going, but they are throwing every resource at this,\" Dr Murphy told reporters on Monday. He said a second wave was when \"the outbreak is such that you don't think the public health measures can easily control it in the short term\". A concern would be a leap of several hundred cases - a level far above the few dozen seen so far. \"The early signs are that it is not escalating at the moment, [but] we have to make sure it is brought under control,\" Dr Murphy said. \"I have great confidence in the Victorians' response on this.\" Reporting by the BBC's Frances Mao Australia during coronavirus", "summary": "在阻止2019冠状病毒病（COVID-19）疫情蔓延上，澳大利亚一直被全球推崇为一个成功范例。"}

Many of them have been anxious about US-China tensions, especially Washington's increased scrutiny of Chinese students in America over technology theft and economic espionage. US Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell told me last month that, against Chinese nationals who concealed military ties and came to the US \"masquerading\" as students, \"we have to defend ourselves\". The US authorities have indicted several Chinese nationals for visa fraud and theft of trade secrets. But many Chinese students see Washington's move as unreasonable, fearing that they are being used as a pawn in the escalating US-China competition. According to an online spreadsheet collecting self-reporting information from affected students, Washington's scope of visa revocation appears to go beyond Chinese graduate students in advanced scientific fields, also targeting undergraduate students and those studying economics and finance.

Seventeen people have been killed on Mt Everest by avalanches - the mountain's worst-ever disaster. Meanwhile a powerful aftershock was felt on Sunday in Nepal, India and Bangladesh, and more avalanches were reported near Everest. The 6.7-magnitude tremor, centred 60km (40 miles) east of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, sent people running in panic for open ground in the city. At the scene: By Surendra Phuyal, BBC News, Kathmandu As military helicopters hovered over Kathmandu and ferried relief supplies to victims of the earthquake in western Nepal, search and rescue efforts were going on in at least five locations in Kathmandu. Near the prime minister's official residence, two bulldozers scoured the rubble of a flattened four-storey house. A bystander said it was the local tax office. The bodies of the four staff inside had been recovered minutes before. As the search and road-clearing efforts got under way at noon, a major aftershock sent people into a panic again. At a nearby open space, people were camped out fearing further tremors. They were short of food and water - clearly hoping and praying that the aftershocks would stop and things would be normal soon. The death toll from the original earthquake on Saturday could rise, as the situation is unclear in remote areas which remain cut off or hard to access. Many mountain roads are cracked or blocked by landslides. Scores of bodies have been ferried to hospitals in Kathmandu, many of which are struggling to cope with the number of injured. More than 700 have died in the capital alone. Tents have been set up in a parade ground in the city centre to house thousands of people displaced by the earthquake. Medics are expecting a fresh influx of patients on Sunday as supplies run low. Rescuers used their bare hands in places to dig for survivors still buried underneath piles of rubble and debris overnight on Saturday. Army officer Santosh Nepal told the Reuters news agency that he and his soldiers had to dig a passage into a collapsed three-storey residential building in Kathmandu using pickaxes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient city's narrow streets. \"We believe there are still people trapped inside,\" he told Reuters. The 7.8-magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara on Saturday morning. There were also victims in India, Bangladesh and in the Chinese region of Tibet. It is the worst earthquake in Nepal since 1934, when some 8,500 people were killed. Analysis - BBC Science correspondent Jonathan Amos Large quakes are generally followed by a flurry of aftershocks, which tend to reduce in strength and frequency as time goes on. As a rule of thumb, seismologists might expect to see at least one aftershock that measures roughly a magnitude less than the main shock. One of these, with a Magnitude of 6.6, was seen just half an hour after Saturday's main 7.8 event. Sunday has now experienced a further big aftershock of 6.7. From the early data, the tremor looks to have originated closer to the surface than Saturday's big shakers. Although each step down on the magnitude scale is a 30-times drop in the energy released, Sunday's big aftershock will not have felt like that for those on the ground. And, of course, it may have toppled many already severely damaged buildings, adding to the difficulties of the rescue operation. Nepal's architectural jewels destroyed Why Nepal is so vulnerable to quakes Challenges of Nepal's quake relief operation 'Moment of crisis' \"We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done,\" Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal told Indian television. \"Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid.\" . Scores of people slept outside on Saturday night - braving wet and cold weather - either because their homes were destroyed or because they feared numerous aftershocks. World leaders and global charities have offered emergency aid to Nepal, as the government grapples with the scale of the disaster. India is at the forefront of the relief effort, offering help including helicopters which have been deployed to remote areas. The United States, Britain, China, Pakistan and European Union countries are among those who have pledged aid. A number of international charities including Red Cross, Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Christian Aid are also sending teams to quake-hit areas. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was especially worried about the fate of villages near the epicentre of the quake, some 80km (50 miles) from Kathmandu. 'Rubble and landslides' The problems have been compounded by erratic internet and mobile phone communications. British Red Cross spokeswoman Penny Sims said it was hard to get an accurate picture of what is going on. \"A lot of the roads are blocked, there's rubble, there's been landslides as well... So that is going to make the aid effort very difficult,\" she told the BBC. Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mt Everest were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche.

They found that the new test had 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The accuracy of a test is based on these two proportions. A test that's highly sensitive will detect almost everyone who has the disease; and a test that has high-specificity will correctly rule out almost everyone who doesn't have the disease. The first ensures not too many false negative results; and the second not too many false positives. India's drug regulator has cleared the test for commercial use. With more than six million confirmed infections, India has the world's second-highest Covid-19 caseload. More than 100,000 people in the country have died of the disease so far. After a slow start, India is now testing a million samples a day in more than 1,200 laboratories across the country. It is using two tests. The first is the time-tested, gold standard polymerase chain reaction, or PCR swab tests, which uses chemicals to amplify the virus's genetic material in the laboratory. The second is the speedy antigen test, which works by detecting virus fragments in a sample. The PCR test is generally reliable and costs up to 2,400 rupees. It has low false positive and low false negative rates. The antigen tests are cheaper. They are more precise in detecting positive infections, but generate more false negatives than the PCR test. Scaling up testing in India hasn't meant easy availability yet, according to Dr Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health and health policy. \"There are still long wait times and unavailability of kits. And we are doing a lot of rapid antigen testing which have problems with false negatives,\" Dr Bhan told the BBC. He believes the Feluda test could potentially replace the antigen tests because it could be comparatively cheaper - and more accurate. \"The new test has the reliability of the PCR test, is quicker and can be done in smaller laboratories which don't have sophisticated machines,\" Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of IGIB, told the BBC. Sample collection for the Feluda test will be similar to the PCR test - a nasal swab inserted a few inches into the nose to check for coronavirus in the back of the nasal passage. India still doesn't allow Covid-19 tests from saliva samples. In the traditional PCR test, the sample is sent to an accredited laboratory where it has to go through a number of \"cycles\" before enough virus is recovered. The new Feluda test uses Crispr - short form for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - or a gene-editing technology to detect the virus. According to researchers, gene-editing works in a way similar to word processing - it's like using the cursor to correct a typo by removing an incorrect letter and inserting the correct one. The technique is so precise it can remove and add a single genome letter. Gene-editing is mainly used to prevent infections and treat ailments like sickle cell disease. When used as a diagnostic tool, like Feluda, the Crispr technology latches on to a set of letters of a gene carrying the signature of the novel coronavirus, highlights it, and gives a read-out on a piece of paper. Two blue lines indicate a positive result, while a single blue line means the test has returned negative. \"Testing remains a limited resource and something that we need to do everything we can to improve its availability. So Feluda is an important step in that direction,\" said Dr Stephen Kissler, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School. The Crispr-based tests are a part of a \"third wave of tests\" after the time consuming and labour intensive PCR and antigen tests, according to Dr Thomas Tsai of the Harvard Global Health Institute. In the US and the UK, several companies and research labs are developing similar paper strip tests which can be cheap and mass produced. One of the most talked-about has been a paper-based strip developed by Sherlock Bioscience which has been cleared for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The test claims to detect the \"unique genetic fingerprints of virtually any DNA or RNA sequence in any organism or pathogen\". DNA and RNA are sister molecules responsible for the storage of all genetic information that underpins life. \"The ideal and ultimate test will be the one that is paper-based which you can do from home,\" said Dr Tsai. \"But of course, there are some biological restrictions to the technology - we can't expect people to extract and amplify the RNA from home.\" This is where the Feluda test might end up making a huge difference to the way we look at gene-editing based diagnostic tests. Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty, a molecular scientist with CSIR-IGBMR and a lead member of the team that developed Feluda, told the BBC that they were working on a prototype of a test where \"you can extract and amplify the RNA at home\". \"We are trying for a simple, affordable, and truly point-of-care test so widespread testing is not limited by machines and manpower,\" Dr Chakraborty said. \"India has the opportunity to show the value of this test, because it has such a big population and it's coming right at the time when it is needed,\" Dr Kissler said. \"If their efficacy is demonstrated, it can have benefits that ripple around the world.\" A vaccine will be vital for fully recovering from the pandemic, but according to Dr Kissler, reliable, accessible testing is also key to achieve \"a sense of normalcy\". \"In the ideal world I envision, taking a test will be as easy as brushing your teeth or making toast,\" he said.", "summary": "印度科学家开发了一种价格低廉的纸质检测新冠病毒的方法，这种方法可以提供类似验孕试纸的快速检测结果。BBC记者苏蒂克·比斯瓦斯（Soutik Biswas）、克鲁提卡·帕蒂（Krutika Pathi）为您解释这种测试方法的原理。"}

She will be responsible for guiding the Biden administration's economic response to the pandemic. The US is struggling to rebound economically from the hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic. At her confirmation hearing on 19 January, Ms Yellen urged Congress to approve trillions more in pandemic relief and economic stimulus, saying that lawmakers should \"act big\" without worrying about national debt. In response, Republican senators warned the former Federal Reserve head this was not the time for \"a laundry list\" of liberal reforms. Ms Yellen disagreed, highlighting the fact that many families whose incomes have fallen were not reached by jobless programmes. She argued that plans to raise taxes must be seen in the context of financing bigger investments necessary to make the US economy competitive. \"The focus now is not on tax increases. It is on programmes to help us get through the pandemic,\" she stressed. Who is Janet Yellen? Janet Yellen was previously chair of the US Federal Reserve. She was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the central bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality. Before then-President Barack Obama named her to lead the Fed in 2014, she had served as one of its board members for a decade, including four years as vice-chair. Donald Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. However, her climb to the top of the economics profession had made her a feminist icon in the economics world. When she left the Fed in 2018, many paid tribute to her leadership by imitating her signature look of a blazer with a popped collar. Ms Yellen is seen as someone able to satisfy both progressive and centrist members of Mr Biden's Democratic party. Her nomination to lead the Fed in 2014 won support from some Republicans. Her focus on employment, rather than inflation, gave her a reputation of favouring low interest rates, which spur economic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money. But under her leadership, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 - albeit less aggressively than some more conservative commentators supported. Her stewardship of that process has won praise on Wall Street, even as it remains hotly debated.", "summary": "珍尼特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）获提名接任美国联邦储备局主席，她将会是首位女性担任这个职位。"}

They come despite a fragile ceasefire holding in the east of the country. The Russian foreign ministry denounced the new sanctions as \"another hostile step in line with the confrontational course\" taken by the US . \"Of course, our retaliatory measures will not keep you waiting,\" it said. The sanctions announced on Friday mean that US citizens will not be able to provide loans lasting longer than 30 days to Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank. They will also affect Rostec, a major technology and defence firm, and technology for Russia's oil industry. \"Given Russia's direct military intervention and blatant efforts to destabilise Ukraine, we have deepened our sanctions against Russia today, in concert with our European allies,\" said US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. \"These steps underscore the continued resolve of the international community against Russia's aggression.\" Both the EU and US say the sanctions can be eased if progress is made on the ground towards peace. 'Lasting settlement' Nato says Russia still has about 1,000 heavily armed troops in eastern Ukraine and about 20,000 more near the border. Russia denies sending direct military help to the rebels, insisting that any Russian soldiers there are \"volunteers\". Mr Lew said: \"It is essential that Russia work with Ukraine and other international partners to find a lasting settlement to the conflict. If Russia does so, these new sanctions could be suspended\". More than 100 top Russian officials and rebel leaders in Ukraine are subject to EU and US visa bans and asset freezes. The US sanctions block support or technology for Arctic and offshore exploration by five Russian energy firms - Gazprom, Lukoil, Rosneft, Surgutneftegaz and Transneft. Rosneft was already listed under a previous round of sanctions and is included in the EU sanctions list. Russia has ambitious plans for Arctic oil exploration. Western partners including ExxonMobil and BP are already involved in multi-billion-dollar projects in Siberia. The EU sanctions also block the export of oil services and deep-water technology. Transneft is also on the EU list, along with Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of gas giant Gazprom. Their access to financial markets will be restricted - a serious matter for Rosneft, which last month asked the Russian government for a $42bn (£25.2bn) loan. Kremlin warning In the EU and US, big Russian state-owned banks are now barred from getting loans with a maturity longer than one month. Reacting to the EU sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that they could undermine the ceasefire in Ukraine. \"I don't even understand what these latest sanctions are about,\" he said. \"Maybe someone is unhappy that the process is taking a peaceful path.\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would \"react in a calm and appropriate way, first and foremost, proceeding from the need to defend our interests\".

A previous study suggested that being bilingual could delay the onset of dementia by several years. The study is published in Annals of Neurology. The big question in this study was whether learning a new language improved cognitive functions or whether individuals with better cognitive abilities were more likely to become bilingual. Dr Thomas Bak, from the Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said he believed he had found the answer. Using data from intelligence tests on 262 Edinburgh-born individuals at the age of 11, the study looked at how their cognitive abilities had changed when they were tested again in their seventies. The research was conducted between 2008 and 2010. All participants said they were able to communicate in at least one language other than English. Of that group, 195 learned the second language before the age of 18, and 65 learned it after that time. Strong effects The findings indicate that those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities compared to what would have been expected from their baseline test. The strongest effects were seen in general intelligence and reading. The effects were present in those who learned their second language early, as well as later in life. Dr Bak said the pattern they found was \"meaningful\" and the improvements in attention, focus and fluency could not be explained by original intelligence. \"These findings are of considerable practical relevance. Millions of people around the world acquire their second language later in life. Our study shows that bilingualism, even when acquired in adulthood, may benefit the aging brain.\" But he admitted that the study also raised many questions, such as whether learning more than one language could also have the same positive effect on cognitive ageing and whether actively speaking a second language is better than just knowing how to speak it. Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, US, said: \"The epidemiological study provides an important first step in understanding the impact of learning a second language and the ageing brain. \"This research paves the way for future causal studies of bilingualism and cognitive decline prevention.\"", "summary": "英国爱丁堡大学的研究显示，学习一门外语、即便是在成年以后，也会对大脑产生积极影响。"}

Thousands of passengers were booked to fly between the two nations on Monday. Both countries have contained Covid outbreaks and kept infection rates low, largely due to tight restrictions. Excited passengers crowded airports in Australia for flights to various parts of New Zealand on Monday, with some rising before dawn to get ready to board. \"I didn't realise how emotional I was going to be today,\" passenger Dawn Tratt told the BBC at Sydney airport. While many buzzed with the anticipation of seeing loved ones, for others it was a more sombre occasion. \"My older brother passed away last week on Thursday, we couldn't get there last week, but it's given us an opportunity to go back home today without quarantine so it's good, very good to go and lay him to rest,\" said John Palalagi in Sydney. Nirali Johal said she was going to see her partner for the first time in almost two years. \"I couldn't sleep last night, it has been very exciting,\" she said. \"We are just... happy that it has happened and we're able to live a normal life again.\" She said she was looking forward to \"going to a café, chilling and do what people do on a normal day face-to-face.\" She added: \"Zoom relations aren't great. I'm over it.\" Australia and New Zealand shut their borders in March last year and brought in compulsory quarantine for returning nationals. Since October, New Zealand travellers have been allowed to enter most Australian states without quarantine, though this had not been reciprocated amid concerns about sporadic Covid outbreaks. To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand. They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria. 'It's weird being on a plane again' The international departure terminal at Sydney airport was very busy, very early in the day. The queue in front of the check-in desk was long and spiralling. Many parents tried to entertain exhausted toddlers who had to wake up exceptionally early to catch the first flight from Sydney to Auckland on Day 1 of the trans-Tasman bubble. Some passengers told me they camped outside from 02:00 local time (Sunday 17:00 GMT) before the airport had even opened. Others said they were so excited they couldn't sleep. The first Jetstar flight was absolutely full. It's a big day for airlines after a catastrophic year because of Covid, and a big sigh of relief for both the travel and tourism industries. But really, this moment is about friends and family reuniting with their loved ones. Dawn Tratt's voice broke a little as she spoke to me ahead of take-off in Sydney. Her cousin is unwell and while this is a hard time for her family, she's glad she'll be able to be there for her. \"We're so privileged here in Australia and in New Zealand to be able to travel like that. It's weird being on a plane again,\" she smiled through her tears. Economic boost The bubble is expected to deliver a lift to both economies, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a joint statement. \"It is truly exciting to start quarantine-free travel with Australia. Be it returning family, friends or holiday-makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself,\" Ms Ardern said. The country relies on Australia for 40% of its international tourism, injecting about NZ$2.7bn (£1.4bn, $1.9bn) into the economy. In the other direction, New Zealanders accounted for 1.3 million arrivals to Australia in 2019, contributing A$2.6bn (£1.46bn; $2bn) to the Australian economy. Qantas, Jetstar and Air New Zealand will all fly routes between the two countries. Still, the leaders warned the trans-Tasman travel bubble will be under \"constant review\" given the risks of quarantine-free travel. The two countries have also previously raised the idea of separate travel bubbles with low-risk places like Singapore, Taiwan and several Pacific island nations. Both nations have won praise for their handling of the Covid pandemic. Strict border controls and snap lockdowns are among the measures that have kept infection rates low. Australia has recorded 910 deaths, and New Zealand 26 deaths. Despite its success in containing outbreaks, the Australian government is facing growing criticism over delays in its Covid vaccination rollout. The country has fallen far behind other nations and failed to meet its immunisation targets. The delays are likely to slow any further easing of border restrictions.", "summary": "在周一（4月19日）的奥克兰机场，到处都是含泪团聚的人们。一年多以来的第一次，澳大利亚居民终于可以自由地来到新西兰。"}

Critics say Zimbabwe's health care system has collapsed, with staff often going without pay while medicines are in short supply. Dr Tedros, who is Ethiopian, is the first African to lead the WHO. He was elected in May with a mandate to tackle perceived politicisation in the organisation. 'Basic necessities lacking' US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it was an embarrassment to give the ambassador role to Mr Mugabe, because his \"utter mismanagement of the economy has devastated health services\". HRW's Kenneth Roth said Mr Mugabe's appointment was a cause for concern because the president and some of his officials travel abroad for treatment. \"When you go to Zimbabwean hospitals, they lack the most basic necessities,\" he said. Zimbabwe's main MDC opposition party also denounced the WHO move. \"The Zimbabwe health delivery system is in a shambolic state, it is an insult,\" spokesman Obert Gutu told AFP. \"Mugabe trashed our health delivery system... he allowed our public hospitals to collapse.\" Other groups who have criticised Mr Mugabe's appointment include the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation and Action Against Smoking. President Mugabe heard about his appointment while attending a conference held by the WHO, a UN agency, on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Montevideo, Uruguay. He told delegates his country had adopted several strategies to combat the challenges presented by such diseases, which the WHO says kill about 40 million people a year and include cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes. \"Zimbabwe has developed a national NCD policy, a palliative care policy, and has engaged United Nations agencies working in the country, to assist in the development of a cervical cancer prevention and control strategy,\" Mr Mugabe was reported by the state-run Zimbabwe Herald newspaper as saying.

Further back in time, film star and Unicef goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn visited disaster zones and graced gala dinners where her glittering presence was an encouragement to donors. The publicity does attract support for relief efforts. But it is hard to imagine 93-year-old Robert Mugabe fulfilling a similar remit. Will he provide comfort in WHO field clinics in conflict zones? Would one of his suit jackets fetch a high price at auction? Would the presence of a man who is widely accused of human rights abuses encourage more $10,000-a-plate attendees at a gala ball? Somehow it just does not seem likely, which begs the question, what exactly is Mr Mugabe going to do in his new role?

The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral structure, rich in marine life. It stretches for more than 2,600km (1,680 miles) along Australia's eastern coast. 'Other alternatives' The dumping is part of a major development that would allow several companies to export coal reserves from the Galilee Basin area through the Abbot Point port. Abbot Point lies south of Townsville on the Queensland coast. Late last year, the government approved an application for the coal terminal to be expanded. The dredging is needed to allow ships into the port. The approved disposal site for the dredged sediment is located approximately 25km (16 miles) east-north-east of the port, inside the marine park. The disposal operation would be \"subject to strict environmental conditions\", the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said when it approved the plan. But the plan remains highly controversial.

It said that measures had been put in place to tackle the impact of run-off, but it would be some time before the effect would be felt. Illegal fishing also remained a problem, despite management reforms. On port development, the report said understanding of the effects of dumping dredged sediment at sea remained incomplete. The expansion at Abbott Point involves dredging to improve access to the port, with the sediment to be dumped within the marine park - a move criticised by conservationists. The GBRMPA report coincided with the release of a strategic assessment by the government on measures needed to protect the reef. \"Together, these reports reinforce there are no quick fixes and it will take time to turn around the overall health of the reef with a concerted effort from government, industries and communities,\" said Environment Minister Greg Hunt in a statement. About A$180m (£99m, $167m) was being invested annually in the reef's health, he said, and an \"overarching framework\" for managing the reef from 2015 to 2050 was being developed. \"We are absolutely committed to protecting and improving the health of this iconic natural wonder so it can be enjoyed by future generations,\" he said.", "summary": "一份报告指出，尽管保护措施不断，澳大利亚著名的自然景观大堡礁的生态前景未来几年仍会恶化。"}

The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea. Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that has affectionately become known as \"Loose Tooth\" because of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. \"It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,\" Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002 that Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. \"I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be,\" she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. \"While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf,\" Prof Fricker added. The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely.

The couple, who have been dating since the summer of 2016, smiled as they posed for photographs outside Kensington Palace in London, where they will live. Prince Harry said it had been a romantic proposal, while Ms Markle said she was \"so very happy, thank you\". Ms Markle, wearing a white belted coat, held Harry's hand as they appeared briefly for the press at the palace's Sunken Garden, and showed off her diamond engagement ring. Asked by a reporter when he knew Suits star Ms Markle \"was the one\", Prince Harry said: \"The very first time we met\". A TV interview the couple are giving to the BBC's Mishal Husain will be broadcast at 18:00 GMT. Kensington Palace said Ms Markle's engagement ring was designed by Prince Harry and features two diamonds which belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre of the ring is a diamond from Botswana, a country the couple has spent time together over the last year and a half. The band is made from gold. Downing Street said there are \"no plans\" for a bank holiday on the day of the wedding. Prince Charles also said he was \"thrilled\", adding that Ms Markle's parents had given their blessing. Prince Harry had already told the Queen and \"other close members of his family\" of the engagement, which took place in London earlier this month, Prince Charles said on Twitter. The announcement, issued by Clarence House, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall's official residence, said details about the wedding day would be unveiled \"in due course\". The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said they were \"delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness\", a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, said they were \"very excited for Harry and Meghan\", adding: \"It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together.\" Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose predecessor officiated at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011, wished them \"many years of love, happiness and fulfilment\". Ms Markle's parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, said their daughter was a \"kind and loving person\" and they were \"incredibly happy\". They added: \"To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.\" Prime Minister Theresa May offered her \"very warmest congratulations\" and wished the couple \"great happiness for the future\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"I wish them well - I hope they have a great life together.\" Prince Harry, 33 and Ms Markle, 36, made their first public appearance as a couple in September at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games, a sporting event set up by the prince for injured, wounded and sick soldiers. Their married home will be the prince's current residence, Nottingham Cottage, on the grounds of Kensington Palace - where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, also have an apartment. Their 16-month relationship began in July 2016 when they met through mutual friends in London. Prince Harry first confirmed his relationship with Ms Markle in November 2016, in a statement from Kensington Palace attacking the media for subjecting her to a \"wave of abuse and harassment\". That statement said the couple were \"a few months into a relationship\" and it was \"not right\" that Ms Markle should receive such treatment. It described nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the \"bombardment\" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. Ms Markle spoke about her love for the prince for the first time in September - telling Vanity Fair magazine: \"We're two people who are really happy and in love\". She said the pair were enjoying a \"special\" time together, adding: \"I'm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time.\" Ms Markle may not have been a familiar name in the UK until recently, but in the US she was known for her role as Rachel Zane in TV legal drama Suits. She attended a private primary school before studying at a girls' Roman Catholic college and later graduating from Northwestern University School of Communication in 2003, just as her acting career was beginning. Ms Markle was previously married, but the Church of England agreed in 2002 that divorced people could remarry in church at the discretion of the priest. What will we call her? The instant Prince Harry and Ms Markle are pronounced \"man and wife\" she will automatically become Her Royal Highness, Princess Henry of Wales. However, she does not automatically become Princess Meghan - because she is not of royal blood. The Queen's late sister Margaret was entitled to call herself Princess Margaret. The Queen's daughter is Princess Anne and her granddaughters are Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. The Queen's great granddaughter, Prince William's daughter, is Princess Charlotte. All of these are, or were, of royal blood and so are princesses in their own right. But Princess Charlotte's mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, is not known as Princess Catherine, just as the Duchess of York never became Princess Sarah and the Countess of Wessex, the wife of Prince Edward, is not Princess Sophie. Lady Diana Spencer was never officially Princess Diana. She was the Princess of Wales and, after her divorce from Prince Charles, she was Diana, Princess of Wales.", "summary": "英国哈里王子刚刚宣布，将迎娶自己的美国女友梅根·马克尔。哈里王子表示他感到“万分激动”。"}

The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital. The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims. But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is \"complete rubbish\" and biologically impossible. The conspiracy theories have been branded \"the worst kind of fake news\" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis. Conspiracy theory Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus. These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US. They appear to fall broadly in to two camps: Both these notions are \"complete rubbish,\" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. \"The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,\" Dr Clarke says. \"Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.\" While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect. \"Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.\" The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays. It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds. \"The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,\" he says. It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology. There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks? Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses. But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated. Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were \"concerning,\" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is \"absolutely no credible evidence for the link\". Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes. Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

There were many wounded at the barracks needing urgent evacuation, he said. Speaking in Kabul, Afghanistan's acting Defence Minister Masoum Stanikzai described the situation in Helmand as \"manageable\" and said fresh support troops had been sent in. Afghan government forces had been \"thinly spread\" over the whole country, he said, and had been trying their best to hold all areas. A small contingent of British troops has been sent to Helmand \"in an advisory role,\" the British government said on Tuesday.

The institute, which looked at 3,418 three-bedroom homes in England, based its findings on building regulations which have come into force in London. The House Builders Federation says that bigger homes could prove unaffordable. Riba's Case for Space study discovered the average two-storey three-bedroom home for five people was 8 sq m (86 sq ft) too small. It claims the shortfall in space is the same size as a single bedroom with a bedside table, wardrobe, desk and chair. The most common new three-bedroom house was found to be smaller still, with 77% of the recommended minimum space - a shortfall equivalent to two double bedrooms. The institute's research was based on the 96 sq m (1033 sq ft) London Plan space standards which have just been introduced in the capital. There are currently no UK-wide standards.

For example, it is calling for floor area to be included in marketing material and floor plans to include furniture, so that people can get a clearer idea of the size of a property. \"Consumers are provided with very poor information when they are buying new homes,\" Mr Rich said. \"In the UK people buy homes based on the number of rooms.

Political leaders, equality organisations and some faith groups welcomed introducing same-sex marriage. But it was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church and Church of Scotland. The announcement was made in the wake of a government consultation which produced a record 77,508 responses. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. The Scottish government said; Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: \"We are committed to a Scotland that is fair and equal and that is why we intend to proceed with plans to allow same-sex marriage and religious ceremonies for civil partnerships - we believe that this is the right thing to do. She went on: \"The Scottish government has already made clear that no religious body will be compelled to conduct same-sex marriages and we reiterate that today. Such protection is provided for under existing equality laws. \"However, our view is that to give certainty on protection for individual celebrants taking a different view from a religious body that does agree to conduct same-sex marriages, an amendment will be required to the UK Equality Act.\" The Scottish government said it was now going ahead with another consultation to consider what extra measures are needed to guarantee freedom of speech, including the protection of religious beliefs of teachers and parents in schools. Ministers said the Scottish Catholic Education Service would continue to decide on the faith content of the curriculum in Catholic denominational schools. Welcoming the government's approach, Tom French, policy co-ordinator for the Equality Network, said: \"Same-sex marriage is about equality and freedom - the freedom for couples, and religious and humanist groups that want to, to celebrate same-sex marriages, but equally, upholding the freedom of other religious groups to say no to same-sex marriages. \"That's the right way for Scotland to deal with the different opinions on this.\" The Church of Scotland, which will report on its own investigation of the issue in May 2013, expressed concern the government was rushing ahead with its plans. The Rev Alan Hamilton, convener of the Church of Scotland legal questions committee, said: \"We are acutely aware that opinions differ among our own members and that many people are anxious and hurt in the current situation. \"We believe homophobia to be sinful and we reaffirm our strong pastoral commitment to all people in Scotland, regardless of sexual orientation or beliefs.\" He added: \"We are concerned the government will legislate without being able to effectively protect religious bodies or their ministers whose beliefs prevent them from celebrating civil-partnerships or same-sex marriages.\" A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland said: \"The Scottish government is embarking on a dangerous social experiment on a massive scale. \"We strongly suspect that time will show the Church to have been completely correct in explaining that same-sex sexual relationships are detrimental to any love expressed within profound friendships.\" Civil partnerships in Scotland offer the same legal treatment as marriage, but are still seen as distinct from marriage.

In the UK, 64% of adults are classed as being overweight or obese. The report predicts a \"huge increase\" in heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. Globally, the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese - classed as having a body mass index greater than 25 - grew from 23% to 34% between 1980 and 2008. The majority of this increase was seen in the developing world, particularly in countries where incomes were rising, such as Egypt and Mexico. The ODI's Future Diets report says this is due to changing diets and a shift from eating cereals and grains to the consumption of more fats, sugar, oils and animal products. A total of 904 million people in developing countries are now classed as overweight or above, with a BMI of more than 25, up from 250 million in 1980. This compares to 557 million in high-income countries. Over the same period, the global population nearly doubled. At the same time, however, under-nourishment is still recognised to be a problem for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, particularly children. Using data published in Population Health Metrics last year, the researchers looked at changing overweight and obesity rates across the regions of the world and by individual country. The regions of North Africa, the Middle East and Latin America saw large increases in overweight and obesity rates to a level on a par with Europe, around 58%. While North America still has the highest percentage of overweight adults at 70%, regions such as Australasia and southern Latin America are now not far behind with 63%. Diet linked to income The greatest growth in overweight people occurred in south east Asia, where the percentage tripled from a lower starting point of 7% to 22%. Among individual countries, the report found that overweight and obesity rates had almost doubled in China and Mexico, and risen by a third in South Africa since 1980. Many countries in the Middle East also had a high percentage of overweight adults. One of the report authors, Steve Wiggins, said there were likely to be multiple reasons for the increases. \"People with higher incomes have the ability to choose the kind of foods they want. Changes in lifestyle, the increasing availability of processed foods, advertising, media influences... have all led to dietary changes.\" He said this was particularly the case in emerging economies, where a large middle class of people with rising incomes was living in urban centres and not taking much physical exercise. The result, he says, is \"an explosion in overweight and obesity in the past 30 years\" which could lead to serious health implications. This is because consumption of fat, salt and sugar, which has increased globally according to the United Nations, is a significant factor in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. The world's top sugar consumers include the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Costa Rica, and Mexico. To combat the rising tide of obesity, Mr Wiggins recommends more concerted public health measures from governments, similar to those taken to limit smoking in developed countries. He said: \"Politicians need to be less shy about trying to influence what food ends up on our plates. \"The challenge is to make healthy diets viable whilst reducing the appeal of foods which carry a less certain nutritional value.\" The report cites the example of South Korea where efforts to preserve the country's traditional diet have included public campaigns and large-scale meal preparation training for women. Alan Dangour, a reader in food and nutritional global health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said urbanisation in many parts of the world had changed people's eating habits away from traditional, healthy diets. But he said obesity and under-nutrition often existed side by side, sometimes in the same household. \"We need to act urgently to deal with the scandal of millions of cases of extreme hunger and under-nutrition in children, but we also need to think what happens if we provide lots of extra calories, containing few vitamins, and encourage excess consumption. \"Clever, joined-up policies are needed.\" A spokesperson from the Department of Health said they recognised that high rates of obesity caused dangerous health conditions and were taking action. \"We are already taking the lead in helping tackle and prevent this challenge, including through the government's Responsibility Deal with industry, NHS Health Checks, the National Child Measurement Programme in schools and through Change4Life. \"For the first time ever, we've given local authorities ring-fenced budgets to tackle public health issues in their local area, including obesity.\" The Department of Health also said that industry and health professionals had a role to play in helping people improve their diet and lifestyles.", "summary": "英国海外发展研究所（ODI）说，自1980年以来，发展中国家的肥胖人口飙升近四倍，已经接近10亿。"}

Mr Cheng says he was forced to \"confess\" to soliciting prostitution. He has complained to the UK broadcasting regulator, Ofcom. CGTN aired the confession in the UK as evidence of his alleged guilt. The channel is the international arm of China Central Television (CCTV) and airs on UK platforms including Sky. Mr Cheng denies China's accusation that he was soliciting prostitutes and says police had in fact questioned him about the UK's role in the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. What happened? Mr Cheng says the confession was extracted after he was tortured at a secret location in solitary confinement. The segment was broadcast on 21 November. A newsreader told viewers he had \"acknowledged his violation of the law\". Mr Cheng also told the BBC that he was accused by the Chinese of inciting political unrest in the city. What's in the complaint? Mr Cheng, whose current whereabouts is being kept secret, accused the state broadcaster of breaching various sections of Ofcom's rules in relation to privacy, crime and disorder, and impartiality among others. Section seven of the code states \"broadcasters must avoid unjust or unfair treatment of individuals or organisations in programmes\". The next section says \"people in a state of distress should not be put under pressure to take part in a programme or provide interviews, unless it is warranted\". \"I was under extreme distress and did not voluntarily make the recording,\" Mr Cheng says in the complaint. \"I was not asked in any way about this news production or broadcast. It was made by police and released by CGTN to exert pressure on me, without any prior contact with me at all.\" Ofcom told the BBC: \"We have received a complaint about a programme broadcast on CGTN which we are assessing as a priority.\" Have there been other cases? In September, the media regulator said it was investigating whether CGTN broke impartiality rules in its coverage of the Hong Kong demonstrations. In May, it launched an investigation into a \"confession\" aired by CGTN of a British investigator. Press TV, the Iranian state broadcaster's English-language outlet, was fined £100,000 ($129,000) in 2011 for airing an interview with Maziar Bahari, an imprisoned Newsweek journalist, which had been conducted under coercion.

TVWS uses gaps in the spectrum assigned for television transmissions. Videos of the animals will be streamed to YouTube 24 hours a day. TVWS uses sections of spectrum either left to act as a buffer between TV signals or space left behind when services went digital. Compared with other forms of wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth and wi-fi, the radio waves can travel longer distances and also travel more easily through walls. The trials are intended to test white space-enabled devices as well as identify what spectrum is available and the processes needed to minimise the risk of interference. It will be used in other projects, including one led by the Oxford Flood Network, a citizen-built wireless sensor network which provides early flood warnings. TVWS has also been earmarked as a way of providing broadband at sea. It will be tested on ferries travelling to the Orkney Islands. However, it has its opponents. The British Entertainment Industry Radio Group has complained that it will pose a threat to the use of radio microphones and other wireless equipment when TV programme makers try to cover events, and could also hamper film production and conferences.

She once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country. \"As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,\" she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University, describes America as \"anti-China\" and \"chaotic\". Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced two historical events - a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped their views of the two nations. 'Politicised' and 'anxious' The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are \"normal\", claiming some are Beijing's proxies who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses. The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America. Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington. Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology. \"I used to think I'd pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China after obtaining a master's degree,\" Tie says. Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now \"politicised and marginalised at an unprecedented level\", as Washington is sending \"very unfriendly signals\". The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have an unfavourable view of China - an historic high. Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students' experience in America. \"If I write the book now, I will only keep 'anxious' in the title,\" she says. 'Unwanted' at home As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be largely under control. But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families. On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country's fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus. \"America wants to kick us out, while China doesn't allow us to return,\" Tie says. This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US. Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as \"being kicked like a ball\" between the two countries. \"We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,\" Li says. Racism 'boosts' support for Beijing After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the coronavirus crisis in the US. They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump's use of the phrases \"kung flu\" and \"China virus\". Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand. Racial discrimination during the pandemic has \"burst their bubble,\" Prof Ma says. A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing's authoritarian rule among Chinese students in the US. Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party. \"That's not the case,\" Prof Pan says, \"What does change their political views is racism.\" The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government's coronavirus handling did not produce the same effects. Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are \"mature, sophisticated and thoughtful for their age\", can rationally process criticism against China. Rethinking China and America Despite her frustration over China's travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard. \"I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don't believe it anymore,\" she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America's \"Sinophobia\". In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong democracy activists. But Tie says she's not a \"little pink\", a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the internet. \"I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,\" Tie says, adding that she views both Washington and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China. \"Both countries let me down many times,\" Tie says, \"but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that frustration.\" Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host countries. In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism. \"It made me feel hopeful about the US,\" Li says, \"This would not happen in China.\" The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it is able to correct its own mistakes. American education has made her \"more anti-China,\" Li says with a laugh. She recalls feeling \"very uncomfortable\" when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence. But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms. \"Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,\" one that she says she'd never regret. \"But I am eager to help change China, where my work may be more meaningful.\"", "summary": "因新冠疫情被困海外，又面临中美紧张局势，在美国的中国留学生进退维谷。国际局势与个人前程的剧变正重新塑造他们对家乡以及异乡的看法。"}

The newspaper explained how the lack of precedent for a case of this kind had forced the deceased couple's parents through a legal minefield before the surrogacy could proceed. No precedent At the time of the accident, the embryos were stored safely in a Nanjing hospital, frozen at minus 196 degrees in a liquid nitrogen tank. A court battle gave the four grandparents-to-be the right over the fertilised eggs. There was no precedent as to whether they could inherit their children's frozen embryos, according to reports. They were eventually granted the embryos, but it wasn't long until the next problem occurred. The embryos could only be taken from the Nanjing hospital if there was proof that another hospital would store them. But given the legal uncertainty around untransplanted embryos, it was hard to find another medical institution in China willing to get involved. And with surrogacy illegal in China, the only realistic option was to look beyond the country's borders. Proving paternity and nationality Eventually, the future grandparents worked with a surrogacy agency and decided on Laos, where commercial surrogacy was legal. As no airline was willing to accept a thermos-sized bottle of liquid nitrogen, the precious cargo had to be transported by car. In Laos, the embryo was implanted into the womb of the surrogate mother and in December 2017 the boy was born. Citizenship of the child, named Tiantian, was another problem though and so he was born not in Laos but in China - with the surrogate travelling there on a simple tourist visa. With no parents left to prove paternity, all four grandparents had to give blood and take DNA tests to establish that the baby was indeed their grandson and that both parents had been Chinese nationals.", "summary": "中国媒体《新京报》报道称，中国一对4年前去世夫妻的遗留胚胎由代孕母亲产子。"}

IS threatened to kill him in footage last month showing the death of Briton David Haines, and in this video they threaten US aid worker Peter Kassig. David Cameron said Britain would do all it could \"to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice\". The prime minister said the killing of father-of-two Mr Henning, 47, showed \"how barbaric and repulsive\" IS was. \"My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan's wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him,\" he said. \"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need.\" Mr Henning's wife Barbara had this week appealed for her husband's release, saying: \"He is innocent.\" Volunteer Mr Henning was on his fourth aid mission to Syria when he was captured within minutes of arriving in the country last December. The prime minister will be briefed by intelligence and security chiefs on Saturday. Downing Street said the \"barbarity\" of the act \"underlines why it is right for Britain to join in the attacks against IS\", according to BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. \"It is also pointed out that ministers have known for some time the risk to Western hostages and cannot allow that to determine British foreign policy,\" our correspondent added. Number Ten has declined to comment on the possible use of special forces in the fight against IS. 'Generous character' IS has previously released videos showing the apparent beheading of two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker Mr Haines. The video released on Friday is yet to be verified, but it appears to show Mr Henning kneeling beside a militant, who is dressed in black, in a desert setting. The footage ends with an IS fighter threatening a man they identify as Mr Kassig. In a statement, Mr Kassig's family said he had converted to Islam and referred to him as Abdul Rahman Kassig. The family asked people around the world to pray for his release and that of \"all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe\". They also asked people to pray for Mr Henning's family, adding: \"We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration.\" Mr Henning's friend Majid Freeman described him as a \"selfless, humble, courageous individual\" who had simply wanted to help others. Mr Freeman, who was with him on the convoy when he was captured, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"He was helping the innocent people the rest of the world had abandoned. \"It doesn't make sense to kill him.\" 'British accent' BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the footage was similar to previous videos released by IS, though slightly shorter. He said it included a reference to last week's vote by UK Parliament to authorise air strikes against IS in Iraq. Like previous videos it features a militant with an apparently British accent, he added. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \"We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents. \"If true, this is a further disgusting murder. \"We are offering the family every support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time.\" The US said it was evaluating the video and if proved real, it was \"another demonstration of the brutality\" of the militant group. Analysis Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News David Cameron's vow to catch the jihadist killers of Alan Henning and bring them to justice would seem to match the mood of the nation. But judging by the track record of previous such cases of hostages being murdered overseas, this promise has little likelihood of being fulfilled. Tony Blair made the same pledge after Ken Bigley from Liverpool was beheaded in 2004, Gordon Brown did the same when tourist Edwin Dwyer was kidnapped and killed in the Sahara, and Mr Cameron vowed to punish those who besieged the Algerian gas plant last year. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, there has not been one single case of any murderers of British hostages ever being brought to justice in Britain. Profile: Alan Henning Henning's home town 'stunned' US President Barack Obama led widespread condemnation of the killing, calling it a \"brutal murder\" and saying it was a \"great loss\" to the Syrian people Mr Henning had been trying to help. Dr Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, tweeted: \"Saddened by reported murder of Alan Henning. A despicable and offensive act. He helped Muslims. My thoughts and prayers with his family.\" Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said: \"This barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg offered his \"sincere condolences\" to the Henning family and said of IS: \"We are resolved to defeat this evil.\" Labour leader Ed Miliband called the killing \"appalling and barbaric\". Earlier this week Mrs Henning had asked for \"mercy\" for her husband, saying his family was continuing their attempts to communicate with the group. She also said she had received an audio message of her husband pleading for his life. Mrs Henning had said some people thought her husband was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but she said: \"He was in the right place doing the right thing.\" Earlier on Friday, the father of another hostage, British journalist John Cantlie, appealed for him to be released \"to those he loves and who love him\". The journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012, has so far appeared in three videos in which he has delivered scripted messages responding to military attacks on IS. RAF Tornados first hit IS targets on Tuesday, four days after Parliament authorised UK involvement in the military campaign. The aircraft have been conducting daily flights over Iraq, and carrying out air strikes against vehicles and weapons positions to assist Kurdish ground forces.

At national team level China also has ambitious goals; it hopes to qualify for another World Cup(their only appearance was in 2002), then host a World Cup (probably in 2030 or 2034), and then kick on and ultimately win a World Cup. But all this is the tip of the football iceberg, and underneath there are grassroots plans to give the sport a sustainable future, centred on infrastructure and youth player development. However, while it is relatively easy to buy a star player, to achieve these other goals will take more planning and long term commitment. Overseas expertise That is creating opportunities for British firms as Chinese entrepreneurs, hoping to profit from President Xi Jinping's edict to make China a successful football nation, seek overseas expertise. \"I first launched a football business in China in 1999,\" says Karl Hawkins, chief executive of Kehua Sports, who accompanied the Chinese president on his fact finding trip to Manchester City two years ago. Over the past 17 years he has built four training facilities in Shanghai, and his firm currently manages two of them; Jing An Stadium and Century Park Stadium. Mr Hawkins, who is also the former technical officer of the Chinese national football team, says: \"At times it seemed there was little interest in the sport in China outside of the dedicated football followers. So we were very pleased with what the president said. \"This is a real opportunity for football to develop in China, but we need to make sure we do things the correct way. We have to be realistic that change will not happen in just one day. \"We have probably done things the wrong way in 20 of the last 30 years. \"The most important thing is the development and creation of youth coaches. But this is not easy in China because not many people are willing to give up their time to do this.\" His firm is constructing a private football academy in the south west city of Kunming, built to European standards, which will not only be used to develop the Chinese coaches and players of tomorrow, but be available for foreign touring sides to train on. Mr Hawkins' academy will have one pitch for community use, and four academy pitches for honing the skills of the potential World Cup winners of tomorrow. Pitch expansion It is all part of another national target to have some 70,000 football pitches across the country, alongside 20,000 training centres, by 2020. By 2025 China wants to have 50,000 schools that are \"powerful in football\". And by 2030 it hopes to have one pitch per 10,000 people. Overlaying the sporting goals, there is an important economic one too, as China wants to develop a $800bn sports economy by 2025, a figure which would represent 1% of its annual domestic economy. In order to help achieve that Beijing has cut taxes for companies specifically in the industry, and removed red to tape to encourage both domestic and foreign investment. Mr Hawkins says he uses British firms for his goalposts, line marking equipment, technology for the upkeep of grass, and most importantly, the construction of the academy buildings and pitches. The latter is being carried out by Manchester firm AFL Architects, which has worked with clubs including Chelsea, Manchester United, Stoke City, Everton, Liverpool and Southampton in developing their training complexes. \"There is a desire to bring Chinese football up to UK and European standards,\" says AFL creative director Phil Osborne. \"Their academy system is different from the UK's. They are not owned by clubs but by private individuals. \"This grassroots route is the way Chinese football has to go, and they have to make use of the UK's long history of football expertise. \"Meanwhile, for us, it gives us access to a new and major marketplace.\" However, all the pitches and infrastructure in the world are useless, as Mr Hawkins intimates, without qualified coaches. Therefore there is a plan to have 50,000 full-time and part-time football coaches trained by by 2020. Strategic importance Celtic is one British football club that is already independently assisting in the development of young players and coaches at a local level in China. It is working with a sports firm operating in Shanghai and Mianyang, which is itself funded by local governments in those two cities. \"It is all part of the central plan to improve football standards,\" says Cheng Zeng, Celtic's business development manager for China. \"Two young Chinese teams have come to train in Glasgow, and coaches have also come for training. We are very pleased to be involved with this. \"We want to help develop their young players all the way up from the school level until they hopefully can make a success at professional level.\" In return Celtic is able to get a presence in a country where the best known overseas teams are the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. He said the club was hoping to sign a partnership deal with a top tier Chinese club soon, and was also in discussions with property firms about the possibility of launching a Celtic skills academy in the country. \"The Asian market is very important to Celtic,\" he says. \"We don't have the financial muscle of some of the bigger European clubs, so we are looking for Chinese partners to help us grow our name in China. \"Meanwhile we can help also teach them other things about football, such as the importance of football clubs being important parts of their local communities.\"", "summary": "近来，国际媒体不断被与“中国”和“足球”有关的消息刷屏：阿根廷足球明星卡洛斯·特维斯（Carlos Tevez）跑到中国超级联赛踢球、中国富商注资著名欧洲球会等等。"}

In total, there are now 30.76 million people in work. Chancellor George Osborne said the fall in unemployment was \"evidence that our long-term economic plan is working\". \"I'm the first to say there are still too many people out of work.

Economists said this suggested the economic recovery could be slowing. \"The UK labour market remains strong.

They described the raid as a major breakthrough against smugglers. Trade in donkey skins is worth millions of dollars, with hides prized in China for supposed medicinal properties. The gelatine in the hides is used as a medicinal tonic, with some believing it can slow down menopause in women. It is also used to try to treat conditions such as insomnia and poor circulation. The raid in Benoni followed a tip-off from a woman who had complained about the smell of rotting meat. Police did not make any arrests at the farm but have said the raid provided important new information about a syndicate suspected of slaughtering the animals and transporting the meat and hides, without them being certified disease-free. South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper said Chinese nationals were suspected of involvement. 'Bludgeoned with hammers' On Monday, the paper reported that a site where more than 100 donkeys were illegally slaughtered had been discovered on a farm in Olifantshoek, in the Northern Cape. The South African National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) spoke of animals there \"being bludgeoned with hammers and being skinned alive\". It called practices there \"barbaric and inhumane\" and criticised the government for \"doing very little to end this illegal practice\". The Mail & Guardian quoted NSPCA inspector Mpho Mokoena as saying a suspect arrested at Olifantshoek had said skins there were transported to Benoni, suggesting a link between the two sites. Police say donkey theft, slaughter and animal skin sales have been rising in South Africa since 2015. Last year, Burkina Faso banned the export of donkey skins and Niger the export of donkeys saying a sharp increase in trade to Asian countries was threatening their donkey populations.", "summary": "南非警方说，最近对约翰内斯堡东部一家农场突击搜查，查获5000张驴皮。当局正在对非法驴皮交易展开调查。"}

There are reports of super-spreading during the new coronavirus outbreak, which has centred on Wuhan, in China. Briton Steve Walsh, who had been in Singapore, has been linked to four cases in the UK, five in France and possibly one in Majorca. Coronavirus claims 97 lives in one day Four more people diagnosed in UK How worried should we be? What it does to the body What is a super-spreader? It is a bit of a vague term, with no strict scientific definition. But it is when a patient infects significantly more people than usual. On average, each person infected with the new coronavirus is passing it on to between two and three other people. But this is only an average; some people will pass it on to nobody while others pass their infection on to far more. How big can a super-spreading event be? Massive - and they can have a huge effect on an outbreak. In 2015, a super-spreading event led to 82 people being infected from a single hospital patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), a coronavirus distantly related to the current virus And in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the vast majority of cases (61%) came from just a tiny handful of patients (3%). \"There were more than 100 new chains of transmission from just one funeral in June 2014,\" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, says. Why do some people spread more? Some just come into contact with far more people - either because of their job or where they live - and that means they can spread more of the disease, whether or not they themselves have symptoms. \"Kids are good at that - that's why closing schools can be a good measure,\" Dr John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says. \"Commercial sex workers were very important in spreading HIV,\" Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, says . Others are \"super-shedders\", who release unusually large amounts of virus (or other bug) from their bodies, so anybody coming into contact with them is more likely to become infected. Hospitals treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) became a major centre of super-spreading because the sickest patients were also the most infectious and they came into contact with lots of healthcare workers. How do they change an outbreak? \"It plays a big role at the beginning of any outbreak, when the virus is trying to get established,\" Dr Edmunds told BBC News. New infections, including the coronavirus, come from animals. When it makes the jump into the first patient, the disease might fizzle out before it can cause a large outbreak. But if it can quickly find its way into a super-spreader, then it gives the outbreak a boost. The same rules apply when cases are imported into other countries. \"If you have several super-spreaders in close proximity, you're going to struggle to contain your outbreak,\" Dr MacDermott says. What will it take to stop coronavirus if there is super-spreading? Super-spreading of the new coronavirus would not be a surprise and will not significantly change how the disease is managed. At the moment, we are completely reliant on identifying cases and anyone they have come into contact with quickly. \"It makes that even more important - you can't afford too many mistakes, you can't afford to miss the super-spreader,\" Prof Woolhouse says. Is it the super-spreader's fault? Historically, there has been a tendency to demonise the super-spreader. \"Typhoid Mary\", Irish cook Mary Mallon (1869-1938), unknowingly passed on typhoid fever when she had no symptoms and ended up spending decades in exile and forced quarantine. But in reality, it's not the patient's fault. \"We need to be careful of the language we use,\" Dr MacDermott says. \"They haven't done anything wrong, this is an infection picked up through no fault of their own. \"They're probably afraid and need love and attention.\"", "summary": "超级传播者，即一人传染多名人员染病的带原者或患者，是几乎每次传染病爆发中都会出现的特征。"}

Many shoppers are well aware the economy is slowing. It is common for people to wait to spend on Singles Day to save money. New data supports nagging concerns about the economy. Inflation is down: non-food prices dropped 0.3% in October, indicating that consumption continues to fall in China - a long-term trend that Singles Day won't fix. Why China's big brands are cashing in on singles 'Power of Chinese consumption' Singles Day has grown tremendously since Alibaba began promoting it as a shopping day in 2009, and now includes many retailers such as rivals JD.com that stage sales promotions. This year, Alibaba said there would be more than 40,000 merchants and 30,000 brands from 25 countries selling goods on its platforms. More than 130 million users have already visited its marketplace app, Taobao, which exceeds the peak from last year. In the lead up to the event, the firm hosted a four-hour TV variety show featuring Chinese celebrities and Western entertainers such as British actor Daniel Craig of James Bond fame. American actor Kevin Spacey appeared as his character President Frank Underwood from the Netflix series House of Cards to wish shoppers a \"happy Singles' Day\" in a two minute video. Alibaba chief Executive Daniel Zhang had said in a statement that the event would mean \"the whole world will witness the power of Chinese consumption\". He promised consumers \"a new surprise every hour\" over the 24-hour marathon, especially mobile users. The firm said more than 27 million purchases came via mobile devices in the first hour. Although its competitors offered attractive discounts, Fangting Sun, China-based analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International said that consumers' attention was still focused on Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall.com. \"[It's] not only due to the wide choices and competitive prices, but also the heavy marketing campaigns especially the successful gala evening which invited lots of famous entertainment stars,\" she said. Kitty Fok, China manager for market research firm IDC said online shopping had become a comfortable channel for most consumers. \"China is a big market with close to one billion smart connected device users - it is a good news for both Alibaba and their competitors,\" she said. Massive scale Alibaba accounts for more than 80% of China's internet sales market. It predicts that 1.7 million couriers, 400,000 vehicles and 200 planes will be making deliveries of products that range from electronics goods to cosmetics despite slowing growth in China.

Current funding streams are too complex, argues author Sir Andrew Witty, boss of GlaxoSmithKline. The government and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, described Arrow Projects as a \"great idea\". Universities Minister David Willetts said the government would consider what recommendations to make following the publication. \"We know that universities are engines of innovation and have an important role to play in driving our industrial strategy,\" said Mr Willetts. 'Invention revolution' The report, entitled Encouraging a British Invention Revolution, says the UK is a world leader in technology and invention, adding that \"the research strength of the UK's universities in an enormous national asset\". But it warns: \"We will have to work hard to maintain our position of strength in the face of increasing competition.\" In his foreword, Sir Andrew writes that UK universities have \"an extraordinary wealth of ideas, technology and human energy - much of which is world-leading and capable of seeding not just new companies but whole industries\". But without better-focused funding, organisation and collaboration, he says, there is a risk of delay and of \"British inventions building foreign industries\". He says a \"thicket of complexity\" in funding \"leads to unnecessary hurdles for those striving to translate ideas to job-creating businesses\". Arrow Projects are his plan for an taking ideas from \"mind to factory\" with a \"globally competitive sense of timing and scale\". If they were successful they \"could herald a British invention revolution to rival the transformation witnessed in the 19th Century,\" Sir Andrew writes. He envisages the projects as large collaborations in technologically advanced fields. The partners would not necessarily be \"geographically co-located\", and would include a range of universities - not just leading research institutions - as well as industry, business and local and central government. The report says the government \"will need to create a new funding stream to bring the Arrow Projects into being.\" Block grants This could be composed of both public and private money, from both new or existing sources and delivered perhaps in the form of block grants which would allow project managers to use their judgement as to how it is spent, it says. Universities and businesses would form themselves into consortiums to bid for the funding. The funding would be channelled through the lead university in each project. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"The future of the UK economy depends upon making the most of the knowledge, innovation and energy to be found in universities.

She was born on Saturday in the Lindo Wing of London's St Mary's Hospital weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg). The Queen and other senior royals were told of the baby's name before the announcement was made public. The BBC's royal correspondent Peter Hunt said that a Kensington Palace official, when asked about the couple's choice of name, said: \"We'll let the names speak for themselves.\" Why Charlotte? Charlotte, the feminine form of Charles, has a long royal pedigree and became popular in the 18th Century when it was the name of George III's queen. The King bought Buckingham House in 1761 for his wife Queen Charlotte to use as a family home close to St James's Palace - it became known as the Queen's House and is now Buckingham Palace. Charles is the name of two former kings and of the Prince of Wales, the princess's grandfather. Charlotte also has more recent connections for the royal couple. On the duchess's side, it is the middle name of her sister Pippa Middleton and on the duke's it is the name of his cousin Charlotte Spencer, Earl Spencer's youngest daughter. The earl tweeted: \"Perfect names. My 2-year old Charlotte Diana will be thrilled at cousinly name-sharing.\" According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, Charlotte is the 21st most popular girl's name in England and Wales with 2,242 babies being given it in 2013. Elizabeth is 39th in the list but Diana is not in the top 100. The duke and duchess and their daughter have been at home in Kensington Palace since leaving hospital on Saturday evening. It is understood they will remain there for the time being before travelling to their country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham estate, in Norfolk. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said the choice of Charlotte as a name seemed to be based on taste rather than history. \"I don't think she is burdened by any history associated with it and to be honest I think they just chose the name because they liked it, which is what they do and what we respect about them. \"We historians can always find someone called Charlotte but I think basically they just liked the name.\" Historian Dr Judith Rowbotham, of the University of Plymouth, said: \"None of the Charlottes in the history of the British royal family have been lacking in character and personality, so one hopes that this one lives up to that name.\" A family name By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Hard facts and royal pregnancies, labours and births are not natural bedfellows. They represent a moment where the very personal, a couple celebrating the arrival of a daughter, collide with the very public - the father is a future king. So, we don't know why William and Kate chose Charlotte as the first name of the fourth in line to the throne. It conveniently has links to the Middletons, the present Windsors and past royals. Elizabeth and Diana are more obvious choices. Prince William has spoken of how, as he becomes older, his grandmother has become an even more important part of his life. And it was inevitable that he would honour his mother and inevitable that he wouldn't \"burden\" his daughter with Diana as a first name. As William said when he gave his fiancee his mother's engagement ring, it's a way of keeping her \"close to it all\". Read more from Peter Prime Minister David Cameron congratulated the duke and duchess on their new arrival and said he had \"always liked the name Charlotte\". \"It's a lovely name, and it must be such a precious time for this young couple,\" he said. Earlier in the day gun salutes took place in London to mark the birth. Soldiers from The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out in a procession from Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace, to sound 41 shots in Hyde Park . At the same time, the Honourable Artillery Company left their Armoury House barracks in the City of London to fire a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London. A Kensington Palace spokesman said on Sunday: \"The duke and duchess are hugely grateful for the messages of congratulations they have received from people all over the world. \"It means a great deal to them that so many people have celebrated the arrival of their new daughter.\" The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall spent more than an hour with their new granddaughter. The duchess's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and sister Pippa also met the princess. Prince Harry, who narrowly missed the princess's birth after returning to Australia to finish his secondment to the country's military, said his new niece was \"absolutely beautiful\" and he could not wait to meet her.", "summary": "肯辛顿宫宣布，剑桥公爵和夫人的新生小公主取名为夏洛特·伊丽莎白·戴安娜 (Charlotte Elizabeth Diana)。"}

Our ancestors settled for 70,000 years, until the local climate changed, researchers have proposed. They began to move on as fertile green corridors opened up, paving the way for future migrations out of Africa. \"It has been clear for some time that anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago,\" said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. \"What has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors.\" Prof Hayes' conclusions have drawn scepticism from other researchers in the field, however. Lakeland haven The area in question is south of the Zambezi basin, in northern Botswana. The researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's huge lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now an area of sprawling salt flats. \"It's an extremely large area, it would have been very wet, it would have been very lush,\" said Prof Hayes. \"And it would have actually provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived.\" After staying there for 70,000 years, people began to move on. Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up. The first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today. This scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans. By combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago. Reconstructing the human story However, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone. Other analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process. \"You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins,\" he told BBC News. \"I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins.\" Thus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down.

Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is, according to IMF projections, slowing to 3.8% this year, the slowest since 1999. Slower, in other words than during the global financial crisis. That projection, released in October, is also down from the 4.4% the IMF published just three months earlier. It is still, however, faster than the increase in population. So economic activity per person, which is a rough, if flawed indicator of average living standards, is still rising. In all but 10 of the 45 individual African countries, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is likely to rise this year. And next year, the IMF forecasts, Africa will regain a bit more momentum, with growth of 4.3%. In the 11 years after the turn of the century, the economy of sub-Saharan Africa doubled in size. In 1993, GDP per person was about the same as in 1970. By 2010, it was 50% higher. China was an important factor, though it can't claim all the credit. There were real improvements in political stability and economic policy in Africa, although some analysis suggests progress in this area may have stalled since the financial crisis. And China emerged as a major source of finance for investment in new commodity extraction and helped boost the international market price for African exports. The consultants McKinsey estimated a quarter of Africa's economic growth between 2002 and 2007 came from energy, metals and other natural resources. There was a further indirect contribution in the shape of government spending financed by revenue from taxes on resource industries. More on China in Africa: The BBC is running a series of pieces about China's role in Africa ahead of the China-Africa summit on 4-5 December in South Africa. In the first decade of the century, base metal and energy prices gained by more than 160%, according to the World Bank. For precious metals, the rise was above 300%, and for agricultural commodities over 100%. Chinese demand for commodities was a key force behind these rising prices. New projects with high costs or in inaccessible locations were made more profitable. But now, the commodity price boom is over. Oil, copper, and aluminium have all fallen by about half from the peaks they reached in the past few years. Iron ore has fallen even more. And these are all important exports for a number of African countries. To take one example, the international commodities producer and trader Glencore has decided to suspend production at copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. And China's slowing growth and its shift towards service industries is a central part of the explanation. The IMF says oil exporters are facing a formidable adverse shock. The big ones are Nigeria and Angola, and they generally get half of government revenues from oil-related activities. The lower oil price will probably lead to investment in new oil production capacity being postponed. The IMF suggests this is especially likely in East Africa. Africa's biggest oil producers are indeed seeing slower growth this year - Nigeria 4% after 6.3% last year, and Angola 3.5% compared with 4.8% in 2014. Strong supply from oil cartel Opec countries and from North American shale oil is perhaps the key force driving prices down. But cooling demand for oil from China is probably also involved. Exporters of other commodities account for 40% of population and economic activity of sub-Saharan Africa. They too will be affected by the decline in prices, but the IMF says the impact will be less than on the oil exporters and they will also get some benefit from cheaper oil. It will enable them to reduce spending on fuel subsidies - or if the lower price is passed on to users, there should be a boost to consumer spending. All the same, the World Bank is concerned about the impact. It said earlier this year: \"Revenue dependence on the commodity sector remains high.\" And if governments scaled back on social services and infrastructure, \"gains in poverty reduction could be lost and prospects for future growth could be damaged by growing infrastructure deficiencies and bottlenecks\". Zambia's central bank raised interest rates sharply a couple of weeks ago, up to 15.5%, to curb the inflation that had resulted from a weakening currency, which was in turn down to the decline in the price of the country's copper exports. The economic growth expected in Africa in the next few years is perhaps a bit of a disappointment after the first decade of the century. Faster growth would do more to ease the continent's persistent poverty problem. But even so, it is a very different and brighter prospect than what Africa went through in the 1980s.", "summary": "中国经济正在放缓，会不会牵连其他经济呢？"}

It was considered by the PM and the National Security Council, as well as US officials, but was deemed too risky. The UK government did not respond to a request for comment. Lord Richards, as he is now, believed his proposal could stem the civilian bloodshed in Syria as rebels fought troops loyal to Mr Assad. The idea was considered by David Cameron and Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, and sent to the National Security Council, Whitehall sources said. It was also put to senior figures in Washington, including General Martin Dempsey, the US's most senior military officer. While it was thought to be too radical at the time, US President Barack Obama said last week he was seeking $500m (£291m) funding to train Syrian rebels - an echo of Lord Richards' plan. Insiders have told BBC Newsnight that Lord Richards, then chief of the defence staff but since retired from the military, warned Downing Street there were only two ways to end the Syrian civil war quickly - to let President Assad win, or to defeat him. 'Extract, equip, train' With ministers having pledged not to commit British \"boots on the ground\", his initiative proposed vetting and training a substantial army of moderate Syrian rebels at bases in Turkey and Jordan. Mr Cameron was told the \"extract, equip, train\" plan would involve an international coalition. It would take a year, but this would buy time for an alternative Syrian government to be formed in exile, the PM was told. Once the Syrian force was ready, it would march on Damascus, with the cover of fighter jets from the West and Gulf allies. The plan envisaged a \"shock and awe\" campaign, similar to the one that routed Saddam's military in 2003, but spearheaded by Syrians. Opportunity 'missed' Though the plan was put to one side at the time, Mr Cameron was later persuaded to consider military action when evidence emerged of chemical weapons use in Syria. However, MPs voted against giving authority for a direct intervention last August. The US and UK accused the Assad government of being behind the attacks, but Damascus blamed rebel groups. Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, an opposition alliance, said: \"The international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground. \"A huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe.\" 'No good options' Professor Michael Clarke, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, added: \"We have missed the opportunity to train an anti-Assad force that would have real influence in Syria when he is removed, as he will be. \"I think there was an opportunity two or three years ago to have become involved in a reasonably positive way, but it was dangerous and swimming against the broader tide of history… and the costs and the uncertainties were very high.\" He said it was now too late for the West to get involved. \"Western policymakers in a sense have got to have the courage to do nothing and to work on what comes after the civil war,\" he said. \"There are no good options over Syria. It is a slow-motion road accident.\" Tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been displaced in three years of civil war in Syria.", "summary": "BBC《新闻之夜》节目披露，英国政府曾计划训练和武装10万名叙利亚叛军，以击败阿萨德总统。"}

Ms Markle, wearing a white boat-neck dress by British designer Clare Waight Keller, was walked down the aisle by Prince Charles. At the altar, Prince Harry told her: \"You look amazing.\" After the service the couple - who will now be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - kissed in front of cheering well-wishers on the steps of the chapel. Thousands of members of the public turned out in bright sunshine to see them driven around Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage. Later, Prince Harry drove the couple to their reception in a 1968 silver blue Jaguar that has been converted to run on electric power, with a registration plate that referenced the date - E190518. Guests at the wedding included Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Sir Elton John, who later performed at the wedding reception. Ms Markle's sculpted dress was designed by Ms Waight Keller for French fashion house Givenchy. Most striking was a diamond bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen, and a trailing five-metre silk veil embroidered with the flowers of each country in the Commonwealth. Prince Harry, 33, and his brother and best man, the Duke of Cambridge, wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. He was given special permission from the Queen to keep his short beard as it is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in Army uniform. Their 10 young bridesmaids and pageboys - including Prince George and Princess Charlotte - rose to the occasion. However, the excitement became too much for one of the younger ones who started crying just before Ms Markle, 36, entered the chapel. Prince Charles walked Ms Markle down the aisle, after her father, Thomas, was unable to attend for health reasons. Mr Markle, 73, reportedly watched the ceremony from California. He told the US celebrity website, TMZ: \"My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy.\" Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, stayed with her daughter overnight before accompanying her to the chapel. Dressed in a pale green Oscar de la Renta dress, with a neat hat, an emotional-looking Ms Ragland sat alone on the bride's side of the chapel for some time. As the witnesses were called to sign the register, Ms Ragland appeared to accept an outstretched hand from Prince Charles with some relief. In her vows, Ms Markle did not promise to \"obey\" her husband, while the prince has broken with royal tradition by choosing to wear a wedding ring. Prince Harry's ring is a platinum band with a textured finish and Ms Markle's has been made from a piece of Welsh gold. 'Power in love' The wedding service combined British tradition with modernity and the bride's African-American heritage. The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the president of the US Episcopal Church, gave an address, the Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, conducted the service and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, officiated. \"There's power, power in love,\" said Bishop Curry, who was invited to speak by Ms Markle. \"If you don't believe me think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved.\" In a fiery, passionate speech, he also referenced the African-American spiritual song Down by the Riverside, which was sung by slaves, and when he realised he had gone on too long, he told his audience he had better wrap up as \"we gotta get you all married!\" Speaking afterwards, Bishop Curry said it was \"a joyful thing\" to see diversity in the ceremony, adding: \"That happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks.\" Lady Jane Fellowes, the sister of Prince Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a reading from the Song of Solomon. Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir performed Ben E King's soul classic Stand By Me during the service. As the bride and groom signed the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason - who won the 2016 BBC's Young Musician - performed three pieces by Faure, Schubert and Maria Theresia von Paradis. He was accompanied by musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia. The gospel choir also performed Etta James' uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine as the newlyweds left the chapel. After the service, the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor along a route lined by tens of thousands of well-wishers. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said more than 100,000 people visited the town on Saturday. Analysis by BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond It was a traditional wedding - the dress, the bridesmaids, the vows, the hymns. And it was very, very different. The Palace made it clear in a stream of announcements that they wanted a different kind of wedding. But it was the service that marked this out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple: the Kingdom Gospel choir setting toes tapping, a young black cellist, and a breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, the President of the Episcopal Church. Every royal wedding is a chance for the Royal Family to relaunch and reinvent. There may have been trouble in the week before the wedding. But that is in the past. This wedding was about the future, a different future for the Royal Family. All 600 guests were invited to a lunchtime reception at St George's Hall, hosted by the Queen. The best man, the Duke of Cambridge, acted as compere. Guests were treated to a performance by Sir Elton John and were served langoustine canapes, Windsor lamb, and champagne and pistachio macaroons. Instead of a formal sit-down dinner, food was served in bowls. The reception also included the cutting of the lemon and elderflower-flavoured wedding cake. Guest Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said Elton John performed a \"mini-concert\". She added that speeches by the Prince of Wales and the groom were \"lovely\", adding: \"Some people were even crying.\" Posting on Instagram, David Beckham said: \"Watching Harry as happy as he was makes us all proud of the man and person he has always been... what a day.\" Other celebrities attending were tennis star Serena Williams, TV personality James Corden, singer James Blunt, actress Carey Mulligan and former England rugby player Jonny Wilkinson. Prince Harry's uncle, Earl Spencer; the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson; and the Duchess of Cambridge's sister, Pippa Middleton, were also invited. Politicians, including Prime Minister Theresa May, were not invited, as it is not a state event. But the former Prime Minister, Sir John Major - a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother - was among the invited guests. About 1,200 members of the public - many who were recognised for their charity work - were invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle for the wedding. Among them was 13-year-old Leonora Ncomanzi, who was overjoyed when she got a wave from the bride herself. \"Meghan waved at me! When she was in the carriage, she saw me and waved - we've got it on video,\" she said. And Pamela Anomneze, in her 50s, said it had been a \"wonderful feeling\" to catch a glimpse of the Queen. On Saturday evening, the newlyweds are celebrating with 200 close friends and family at a private reception less than a mile from Windsor Castle at Frogmore House, hosted by Prince Charles. Ms Markle was expected to break with tradition for royal brides and make a speech at the event. The Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception.", "summary": "哈里王子和梅根·马克尔在温莎城堡圣乔治教堂喜结连理; 两人被女王册封为萨塞克斯公爵和萨塞克斯公爵夫人 。他们公布了3张正式的婚礼照片。"}

This is not about mass surveillance and vacuuming up a haystack of data to search for a needle,\" he told the BBC. \"They need warrants, they can't just tap in to any phone - it doesn't work like that.

To do so would expose the public to the very real danger of criminals reusing those exploits still working. These were kept in a controlled environment for a reason.\" However, Access Now said the CIA's decision to keep security flaws to itself had \"significant repercussions for human rights and digital security\". Whistleblower Edward Snowden criticised the scope of the CIA's methods. \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"That's today\". Are 'smart' devices safe? Homes are becoming increasingly \"smart\", with everything from light switches to voice-activated kitchen appliances connected to the internet. If unsecured, these could reveal our activities in the home. \"The concept that intelligence agencies are doing broad personal surveillance using these devices is not realistic,\" said Mr Smith. \"I would be amazed if that was the case because the resources to make sense of all the data just aren't there. \"My concern is much more what online criminals might be able to achieve with these devices. There are plenty of examples of things such as baby monitors being open to the wider internet.\" The documents published by Wikileaks detail ways in which some Samsung televisions could be used to spy on their owners. Mr Woodward said it was unlikely the exploit was widely used. \"They're talking about a few models of Samsung TV. If you read the documents, they have been vulnerable for a while. It would be surprising if the CIA was not looking into that,\" he said. \"Has the CIA remotely hacked them? No. They have to get into your home and plug a USB drive in to them. It's a high risk. If you have to get in to somebody's house you can give yourself away.\" Mr Woodward said anybody worried that their appliances were spying on them could \"unplug them at the wall\". That advice may not help those with a modern voice-controlled fridge-freezer, the likes of which have started to go on sale. However, SecureWorks' Mike McLellan, who previously worked at the UK government's National Cyber Security Centre, said the average household should have \"bigger concerns\". \"You are more likely to be a victim of cybercrime or ransomware, than happen to become a subject of interest for an intelligence agency.\" Can the CIA read my WhatsApp or Signal messages? Encrypted messaging apps offer people some peace of mind that their private messages cannot be intercepted as they travel across the internet, as the messages are scrambled. The CIA documents describe methods to compromise smartphone operating systems such as Android and iOS, which could let agents read messages sent via encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Mr Woodward said the documents did not suggest the CIA had \"cracked\" the encryption of either platform. Instead, messages could be read by compromising the \"end point\" - the sender or receiver's smartphone - where the messages are already decrypted. He said the documents indicated that governments \"accept that encryption is going to become commonplace on networks\" and that they must focus efforts on \"getting in to the end points to read messages\". \"They know banning encryption is not going to work,\" he said. Should the CIA have helped fix security flaws? Mr Snowden has described the CIA as \"reckless beyond words\", for keeping knowledge of security holes in devices such as smartphones to itself. \"The CIA reports show the [United States government] developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Why is this dangerous? Because until closed, any hacker can use the security hole the CIA left open to break in to any iPhone in the world.\" Mr Woodward said he was not surprised that the CIA had not disclosed security holes it had found to manufacturers such as Apple and Google. \"If your mission is to spy, are you going to tell people something only you know about?\" he asked. \"This is the CIA, not a computer security agency. If they have [exploits] they are going to use them. It's somebody else's job to fix them.\" Mr McLellan said it was \"a fact of life that intelligence agencies will look for security vulnerabilities\", but added that private companies were also searching for flaws and \"selling them to the highest bidder\". That concerns Mr White, who suggests keeping flaws secret puts ordinary citizens at risk. \"It's simply a fantasy to believe that only the 'good guys' will be able to use these tools,\" he said in a blogpost. \"It is critical for governments, law enforcement, technologists, and civil society to have an honest conversation about the impact of government hacking in the digital age.\" However, Mr Woodward said it was likely that many of the security flaws in the leaked documents had already been fixed. \"The idea that the CIA is hoarding [security flaws] is not true. These things are relatively rare... and fixes for them move so quickly that a year or two is almost another era in technical terms,\" he said. \"I would be surprised if they were 'stockpiling' such exploits. I think you'll find they use them while they still can.\" Will artificial intelligence threaten our privacy? Routine recording of the population would be a huge, and potentially unfeasible, undertaking for an intelligence agency. However, developments in artificial intelligence could make processing data faster and easier. Companies - including Amazon and Google - already sell voice-controlled speakers and smartphones that can understand commands and transcribe speech. Such technology could one day be used to help monitor citizens. \"There is the ability to collect telephony en masse now,\" said Mr Smith. \"AI may speed it up and make more sense of the data, but I don't think it's something the average person should be worried about. It could be a future risk, among many future risks.\" Mr Woodward added: \"Think of the volumes of data you'd be dealing with. They don't have the ability to record every phone conversation in the world, let alone every conversation within ear-shot of a phone. \"If you're not a person of interest, they just don't have the capacity.\"", "summary": "在维基解密（Wikileaks）周二（3月7日）公开的数千份文件曝光了有关美国中央情报局（CIA）黑客入侵工具的细节。"}

The recall affects products and exports to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sudan. It covers hundreds of baby milk powder products marketed globally under the Milumel, Picot and Celi brands. Lactalis is one of the world's biggest dairy producers. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP \"nearly 7,000 tonnes\" of production may have been contaminated, but the company is currently unable to say how much remains on the market, has been consumed or is in stock. Lactalis believes the salmonella outbreak can be traced to a tower used to dry out the milk powder at its factory in the town of Craon in northwest France, according to AFP. All products made there since mid-February have been recalled and the company said precautionary measures have been taken to disinfect all of its machinery at the factory. The recall expands a health scare that started at the beginning of December after 20 children in France under the age of six fell sick. At the time a limited recall was issued but regulators found the measures Lactalis had put in place to manage the contamination risk were \"not sufficient\". Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning and symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The illness, caused by intestinal bacteria from farm animals, is dangerous for the very young and elderly because of the risk of dehydration. It is not the first time the baby milk formula industry has been rocked by a health scare. Six babies died and around 300,000 others fell ill in 2008 after Chinese manufacturers added the industrial chemical melamine to their infant milk powder products.", "summary": "法国婴儿配方奶粉生产商拉克塔利斯(Lactalis)集团，已下令进行全球产品召回，因担心部分产品被沙门氏菌感染。"}

Authorities had already tightened security, deploying more than 1,400 armed officers at hotels and beaches. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in a national address that \"exceptional measures\" were needed. \"In order to face up to this scourge we need to be prepared. We need to have enough troops, proper training and material means - we are in desperate need of material means,\" he said, appealing for international counter-terrorism support and co-operation. The state of emergency will be in place for a renewable period of 30 days. An official from the prime minister's office said several officials had been sacked in the wake of the attack, including the governor of Sousse. \"Just as there have been security failures, there have also been political failures,\" Dhafer Neji told AFP. Security forces were criticised for not responding more quickly to the attack on 26 June in Sousse, when a gunman opened fire on tourists on a beach and in a hotel before being shot dead by police. Those killed included 30 Britons. The gunman has been identified as student Seifeddine Rezgui, who authorities say had trained in Libya. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid conceded in a BBC interview on Friday that the slow response of the police was a key problem. He said Rezgui had probably trained with the Ansar al-Sharia group, though Islamic State (IS) earlier said it was behind the attack. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Rezgui, and the government says it has uncovered the network behind the Sousse attack. Authorities have also pledged to close some 80 mosques that were operating outside government control and accused of spreading extremism. Analysts say Tunisia has been put at risk by the chaotic situation in neighbouring Libya, and by the danger posed by Tunisians who have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq returning home. In his speech on Saturday, Mr Essebsi spoke in general terms about the threat posed by Libya. He also spoke at length about the economic and social challenges facing the country, including high unemployment and poverty in the country's interior. Tunisian security forces had responded to security challenges \"gradually\", he said, \"because we did not have the culture of terrorism in Tunisia\". The last time Tunisia declared a state of emergency was in 2011, in the uprising which overthrew President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. It was lifted in March 2014. Officials are expected to pass a counter-terrorism bill that has been in parliament since early 2014 in the coming weeks. The Sousse attack represented the second blow in three months to Tunisia's tourism industry, an important sector for the country.

China has summoned the US ambassador in Beijing over the incident. It says relations will be damaged. US prosecutors say the officers stole trade secrets and internal documents from five companies and a labour union. The BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai says it is extremely unlikely that any of the accused will ever be handed over to the US. China's defence ministry put out a strongly-worded statement on its website on Tuesday saying that China's government and its military \"had never engaged in any cyber espionage activities\". It also took aim at the US, saying: \"For a long time, the US has possessed the technology and essential infrastructure needed to conduct large-scale systematic cyber thefts and surveillance on foreign government leaders, businesses and individuals. This is a fact which the whole world knows. \"The US' deceitful nature and its practice of double standards when it comes to cyber security have long been exposed, from the Wikileaks incident to the Edward Snowden affair.\" Analysis: Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor China always insists it is a victim of hacking, not a perpetrator. And when US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden appeared in Hong Kong a year ago with evidence of US hacking into Chinese networks, Beijing felt vindicated. The US acknowledges that it conducts espionage but says unlike China it does not spy on foreign companies and pass what it finds to its own companies. Beijing typically shrugs this off as a smear motivated by those who find its growing technological might hard to bear. But to see five named officers of the People's Liberation Army indicted by a US grand jury is not something that can be brushed aside so easily. China has already announced the suspension of co-operation with the US on an internet working group. And once it has had time to digest this loss of face, it is likely to consider more serious retaliation. The defence ministry added that China's military had been the target of many online attacks, and \"a fair number\" of those had been launched from American IP addresses. It said the arrest of the five Chinese army officers had \"severely damaged mutual trust\". A Xinhua report on Tuesday stated that between March and May this year, a total of 1.18 million computers in China were directly controlled by 2,077 machines in the United States via Trojan horse or zombie malware. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang lodged a \"solemn representation\" with US ambassador Max Baucus on Monday night, Xinhua reported. 'US losses' On Monday US Attorney General Eric Holder said a grand jury had laid hacking charges against the Chinese nationals, the first against \"known state actors for infiltrating US commercial targets by cyber means\". He identified the alleged victims as Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Alcoa Inc, Allegheny Technologies, SolarWorld and the US Steelworkers Union. \"The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,\" Mr Holder said. In the indictment brought in the western district of Pennsylvania - the heart of the US steel industry - the US named Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, all officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the alleged conspirators. FBI officials said the hacking - between 2006 and 2014 - caused \"significant losses\" at the companies and that there were likely to be many more victims. Last year, cyber-defence company Mandiant published a report on a Chinese military unit the firm said was behind the vast majority of significant attacks on American federal agencies and companies. In March, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon planned to more than triple its cyber-security capabilities in the next few years to defend against such internet attacks.

He has been open about his sexuality, but has also tried to maintain a basic level of privacy until now, he said. This week Mr Cook challenged his home state of Alabama to ensure the rights of gay and transgender people. Privacy trade-off \"While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven't publicly acknowledged it either, until now,\" he wrote. \"So let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,\" he added. He said he didn't consider himself an activist, but that he realised he had \"benefited from the sacrifice of others.\" \"So if hearing that the CEO [chief executive] of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy,\" he added. Mr Cook said that he had been open about his sexuality with many people, including colleagues at Apple, but that it still \"wasn't an easy choice\" to publicly announce his sexual orientation. He quoted civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King, saying: \"Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?' \" Analysis Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent Tim Cook's announcement may come as no surprise in Silicon Valley or across corporate America. But that does not mean that we should underestimate the significance of the leader of the world's most valuable company talking openly about his sexuality. Back in May, a piece in the New York Times asked \"where are the gay chief executives?\" and struggled to name any openly gay CEOs at America's 1,000 biggest companies. Apple under Steve Jobs was not a company that took a stand on any issues which were not seen as relevant to its business. Tim Cook has been more forthcoming on all sorts of issues, including equal rights for gay workers, and while he says he does not see himself as an activist, that is how many will now see him. That could embroil him in controversy in the United States, let alone in other parts of the world with less liberal views of sexuality. Mr Cook admitted that going public as a gay man was not an easy choice - but it certainly looks a courageous one. This week Mr Cook referred to Martin Luther King in a speech in Alabama in which he called for equal rights for people based on sexual orientation and identity. He said that Alabama had been too slow to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities in the civil rights era, and was now being too slow to guarantee gay rights. \"Under the law, citizens of Alabama can still be fired based on their sexual orientation,\" Mr Cook said. \"We can't change the past, but we can learn from it and we can create a different future.\" Mr Cook has championed equality at Apple, but in August said he was \"not satisfied\" with workforce diversity at the company. Outstanding, a not-for-profit professional network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) executives, said on Thursday that many LGBT people in the UK felt it was \"safer to stay in the closet\" when at work. In May a US study by LGBT organisation Human Rights Campaign suggested that 53% of US LGBT employees had not come out at work. 'Role model' Former BP chief executive Lord Browne, who now chairs fracking company Cuadrilla, said Mr Cook had become a role model. \"By deciding to speak publicly about his sexuality, Tim Cook has become a role model, and will speed up changes in the corporate world,\" Lord Browne said. The peer kept his sexual orientation a secret for decades, but was forced to come out after a boyfriend made his sexuality public in 2007.

Ligia and her family have been self-isolating since 18 March, because her mother is heavily pregnant. As someone who was always out, seeing friends and working, she has found it challenging to be stuck in a flat with four people. \"Since going into isolation my anxiety has really increased,\" Ligia says. \"It often comes really unexpectedly. I have trouble breathing and thinking straight. It's just a sense of all-over-the-place-ness.\" The biggest blow was the government's cancellation of the A-levels she had been revising for. \"It was really tough to hear. I cried. It had a big impact on me,\" she says. \"It was like I had been preparing to run the marathon and I was at the start line and they were counting down, 3, 2, 1 - and then they tell you they're not going to run the race.\" School has been part of Ligia's life for as long as she can remember, so being unable to \"close that chapter properly\" is very hard, she says. \"I can't distract myself by going out. I spend my days doing revision.\" It's hard to be motivated when this revision may never be tested, but Ligia has found ways of improving her mental health. \"I make my bed in the morning so I won't get back into it. I try to regulate my breathing and listen to a lot of deep relaxation music,\" she says. \"Meanwhile I'm keeping busy by learning about witchcraft online - teaching myself something gives me that feeling of: 'Yes, I can do this alone.'\" Naomi, 21, a final-year psychology student from Cardiff, says her anxiety has increased hugely due to the coronavirus. Her finals were cancelled, and although the lectures and exams have moved online, the loss of routine and uncertainty around grading have affected her. The things she used to do to manage her anxiety, such as volunteering, and following a strict routine that got her out of the house, are no longer an option. So she has had to develop new coping strategies. Naomi finds that keeping a journal helps, using prompts like: What's making me feel this way? What am I grateful for today? \"Those questions point me to think about what I have done during the day and what's been positive, and also write about the things that I'm worrying about,\" she says. Another positive is the strong sense of community that the coronavirus crisis has created. \"We're all in this together and it is quite nice to know that there's people out there who understand those worries,\" she says. At the same time, she's concerned that people like her, with longstanding mental health problems, might be forgotten. A survey by YoungMinds has shown that the coronavirus pandemic is having a profound effect on young people with existing mental health conditions. Although they understood the need for the measures taken in response to the virus, the report says, this did not lessen the impact. Many of those who took part in the survey reported increased anxiety, problems with sleep, panic attacks or more frequent urges to self-harm. Professionals who work in the young people's mental health sector are continuing to provide support where they can, the charity reports. \"They are going to remarkable lengths to reach young people, even though face-to-face contact is now usually restricted and remote support is often challenging,\" says Emma Thomas, Chief Executive of YoungMinds. \"While we recognise the huge efforts being made, we need to find ways to help those young people who have lost their support - not least because, in many cases, they have also lost many of their coping mechanisms, including contact with friends or routines that help them to manage their conditions. We also know that many young people who previously might not have needed mental health support are likely to do so in future.\" Another organisation that has noticed changes as a result of coronavirus is Shout, a free 24-hour texting service for people in crisis. Over the past week, they have experienced a steady increase in the number of people contacting them, peaking at more than 1,000 conversations on Sunday. Around 70% of their texters are under the age of 25 and in that age group they have seen a growing number of conversations about coronavirus, currently around 25% of all conversations daily. Alongside that, they are seeing an increase in conversations about anxiety, while conversations about coronavirus are almost twice as likely to involve anxiety (60%) as usual. \"It is just anxiety, anxiety, anxiety,\" says Amy, one of Shout's Crisis Volunteers. \"The overall theme has just been the lack of control.\" Amy says people in crisis can find it hard to even pick up the phone, so texting can be easier. In her conversations, she aims to de-escalate the crisis and decide on next steps. Many texters are struggling with the loss of routine, so she has been helping them find new ones. \"Without a routine, I know that a lot of bad habits and bad thoughts can come in,\" says Amy, who has experienced mental health problems herself. One texter was distraught because since the West End shut down they could no longer meet up with friends to see a show. The plan they came up with was to make a scrapbook with all their tickets and write down their memories. Since the shutdown, John 18, from North London, has found it harder to distract himself from his depression. His family have been self-isolating since 15 March, after his mother, who works in a school, fell ill with suspected Covid-19. Being forced to stay indoors has had a negative impact on John's mental health. \"Normally, if I was feeling really bad, I would go on a bus ride and be able to just clear my thoughts for a bit,\" he says. \"I would pick a bus number and take the route fully. But I can't really do that now. I'm stuck in my mental cycles and I've been feeling especially low. I'm not able to come out of it as easily.\" John missed a term-and-a-half of school due to a serious depressive episode, and had already decided to repeat Year 13. The closure of his school has actually helped him because all their educational resources are now available online - and he prefers this method of learning to the classroom. However, he has not yet been able to meet his new adult counsellor because of the lockdown, and that worries him. \"I don't want to feel worse,\" he says. Even though he's \"pretty nocturnal\" he tries to get out of his bedroom as much as possible so he can sleep better. \"If you're constantly thinking and being busy in your bedroom, when you eventually want to go to sleep, you're going to be stuck with those thoughts. Try and go into the living room or garden if you can. I feel that helps me.\" Thirteen-year-old Chloe was up until midnight tidying her bedroom earlier this week, just to keep busy. \"Once she starts something she gets quite obsessive about it,\" says her mother, Julie Cambridge. The family have taken great care to self-isolate because Julie is a carer for her adult daughter and grandchildren, who live a few doors away on their Brixton estate and she cannot risk getting ill. Chloe, her youngest daughter, has ADHD and anxiety, and since the schools closed she has been \"climbing the walls\", says Julie. She's very sporty and sociable and would usually be out running or mixing with friends. \"Now I feel bored and lazy,\" says Chloe. \"I want to go outside because I feel claustrophobic.\" She listens to music, stays in touch with friends on social media and does her school work via Google classroom. But her anxiety has got worse, and she's been moody. \"I can get aggravated easily, and I'll probably give you attitude,\" she says. By contrast, Julie's 16-year-old daughter, Jade, has never been one for going out. \"Since primary school, she's just come home and done homework every day,\" Julie says. But Jade was \"knocked for six\" when her GCSEs were cancelled. \"I was gutted, honestly, I was very stressed,\" says Jade. \"I've put a lot of effort into these exams, prepared myself really well. Now we're not even getting the opportunity.\" She's still studying but admits that she's lost a lot of motivation, and that it has affected her mental health. \"I'm quite stressed about everything. It's affecting my mood, definitely. I'll become very down and distant from everyone.\" Jade wants to go to university to do biomedical science. Her predicted grades are good, but she was looking forward to doing even better; studies have shown that university applicants from low-income backgrounds are significantly more likely to have their grades under-predicted than those from high-income backgrounds. \"Everybody has low expectations of the children from this area. It isn't the norm for someone to achieve and make something of themselves,\" says Julie, who wonders how all this will affect Jade in future. \"I'm worried they will be known as the 'Covid generation', the ones who didn't do their exams - will people look at them differently because they didn't sit down and do that test? \"It's the sense of achievement that they're missing out on.\" Exams and graduations are rituals and milestones that are important in a young person's development, says Hanspeter Dorner, a Consultant Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist in East London. \"Missing out on these milestones can have an adverse impact, but perhaps you can recreate these rituals at a later date.\" Naomi and her fellow university students are doing exactly that - they are still planning on holding the Psychology Ball at a future date. \"We can schedule it at the same time of our actual graduation so that we still get to have those celebrations,\" she says. \"They're a way of marking the closure of something, and it's really important that we still get the opportunity to do that.\" Top tips for looking after your mental wellbeing while at home Be safe and stay connected - Self-isolation doesn't mean cutting off all communication, in fact, it's more important than ever to talk and listen, share stories and advice, and stay in touch with the people who matter to you. Take notice of things that make you feel good - Eating healthy food, keeping moving by going out for walks or exercising can help us to feel good. Notice the beauty outside your window or on a walk around the block, taking time to acknowledge people you see. Go on an information mini-break - the endless updates from news outlets and people on social media can be completely overwhelming. Pick one trusted source of information and visit it once a day only. Share how you're feeling - Talk to loved ones and friends. Talking has the effect of lifting our mood and really helps us to begin to feel more positive if we're having a tough time. Keep moving - Find ways to move your body and your mood every day. It's OK to go for a walk, run or ride your bike, as long as you avoid other people. Stick to a routine - This sounds dull but it will help you get through each day. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat regularly, shower, change your clothes, get some fresh air, book in video-chats with colleagues or friends, do your chores. Make time for fun! Find ways to relax and distract - Finding things that help you breathe deeply, consciously setting your worries aside or focusing on the moment to recharge can be helpful. Distracting yourself by watching films or TV programmes, reading or listening to music will help you to set things in context and provide relief from anxious feelings.

The son of a wealthy entrepreneur, he caused controversy in 2014 when he was revealed to have fathered at least 16 babies via surrogates in Thailand. His so-called \"baby factory\" case and others led to Thailand banning commercial surrogacy for foreigners. Mr Shigeta, who was not present at the trial, was awarded \"sole parent\" rights after the Thai surrogates forfeited their rights, according to the court, which did not name him. \"For the happiness and opportunities which the 13 children will receive from their biological father, who does not have a history of bad behaviour, the court rules that all 13 born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff,\" Bangkok's Central Juvenile Court said in a statement. Mr Shigeta was awarded custody of his three other children in 2015. In 2014, he was investigated by Interpol for human trafficking after it emerged he had fathered 16 surrogate children in Thailand. His Bangkok apartment was raided and police found nine surrogate babies, nannies and a pregnant surrogate mother there. He left Thailand soon after, but later sued the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security for custody of the children. You may also like: 'He wanted a very large family' By Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondent When a blurred airport security photo was published, more than three years ago, of Mitsutoki Shigeta, holding an infant as he left Thailand, there was fevered speculation over his motives for siring so many children with surrogate mothers. Some of the children had already been taken to Cambodia, and the Thai police began investigating him for possible human trafficking. But his lawyer insisted he simply wanted a very large family, and that as the son of a wealthy Japanese entrepreneur he was able to look after them properly. A court in Bangkok has now accepted that explanation: Thai officials told the court they had travelled to Cambodia and Japan, and found he had enough carers and facilities to bring up the 13 children who are still in state care in Thailand. What is known about the father? Few details are known about the background of Mr Shigeta. According to Japanese media, he is the son of an IT billionaire and paid between $9,300 (£6,600) and $12,500 to each of the surrogate mothers. Thai media says Mr Shigeta is unmarried, owns several companies himself and has already made plans for the future of his children, including setting up trust funds for them. After leaving Thailand four years ago, he was thought to have moved to Hong Kong and currently lives in Japan again. Media reports also suggest he might have travelled to India and Ukraine to father children there. Gradual transfer of custody The 13 children will not immediately be transferred into Mr Shigeta's custody. His lawyer told AFP news agency that he would contact the Social Welfare Ministry about next steps, adding that the timelines still had to be agreed to avoid \"abrupt changes\" for the children. Mr Shigeta's case shed light on Thailand's booming surrogacy industry, as did the case of \"Baby Gammy\" which also emerged in 2014. Baby Gammy's Thai surrogate mother alleged that he was abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down's Syndrome. They took his twin sister home.

But 17% told international student recruiters Hobsons that Brexit would make UK universities more attractive. The Vote Leave campaign said it was crucial to ensure there were enough places for young people from the UK. Hobsons managing director Jeremy Cooper said: \"A vote for Brexit would represent a further challenge. \"For universities in the UK, the conditions for recruiting international students are tougher than ever before.\" The survey participants had applied for or enquired about study at 15 UK universities - including two from the elite Russell Group and seven new universities. Three-quarters were from countries outside the EU, two-thirds were interested in post-graduate study, just over half were female and almost two-thirds were aged under 24. Of the 1,529 who expressed an opinion: There was considerable variation between EU and non-EU students, with 82% of EU students saying Brexit would make the UK less attractive compared with 35% of non-EU students. Although they admit accurate predictions are impossible, the researchers believe international student applications could be at risk if attitudes change as the survey suggests. Based on 2014-15 figures, when there were 240,767, international students in the UK, 113,116 international students \"could be at risk of being put off\" studying in the UK, says the report. It suggests the UK could potentially lose 50,056 EU and 63,060 non-EU students. Paul Blomfield MP, co-chairman of the newly formed all-party parliamentary group for international students, called the report \"worrying\" \"Leaving the EU would make the UK a less attractive destination for study, and that is bad news for our economy,\" he said. \"Across the country, hundreds of thousands of jobs would be at risk.\" His co-chairman, Lord Bilimoria, said the findings were consistent with views he had been hearing from around the world. \"It is not scaremongering,\" he said. \"It is reality.

That's something we're rightly proud of as a country. \"Understandably, the calibre of our universities attracts a large number of applications from foreign students - but arguably the most important thing is to ensure that there are sufficient places for our young people.\" And a spokesman for Scientists for Britain noted \"a huge difference between the 'UK study less attractive' response from non-EU students (35%), who contribute up-front and pay higher tuition fees, and EU students, who pay lower fees and are eligible to access UK student loans\". \"Given that the financial contribution of non-EU students is significantly more important to the UK Higher Education sector, we are reassured that the vast majority of non-EU students (65%) recognise that Brexit is much less of a concern for them, and may even level the playing field in terms of being able to secure student visas to study in the UK.\"", "summary": "调查显示，如果英国退出欧盟，英国的大学吸引力会下降，很难招收到国际学生。"}

In recent years, he has been drawn back into politics because of his vocal opposition to current Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has been embroiled in a multi-billion dollar financial scandal involving a state development fund called 1MDB. Mr Mahathir cut links with the ruling UMNO party and in 2016 started a new party, Bersatu, which joined the Pakatan Harapan opposition alliance.

His deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, was abruptly sacked in 1998 over political difference, and was then jailed for six years on sodomy and corruption charges.

The government says Franco's remains will be exhumed on Thursday and moved to a cemetery in Madrid. But why were there calls for Franco's remains to be moved in the first place? And why has the issue proved so controversial? Franco ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. He was buried in a mausoleum called the Valley of the Fallen, just outside Madrid. But that site has become a shrine for the far right and is loathed by many Spaniards. Spain's Socialist government plans to move Franco's remains next to his wife's grave in a cemetery in Madrid. The exhumation is likely to last about three hours. The remains will probably be transferred by helicopter to avoid any protests. Franco's family and his far-right supporters tried in vain to block the government's plan. Franco won Spain's 1930s civil war, which was started when he rebelled against the elected leftist government. He established a dictatorship and proclaimed himself head of state. He maintained a tight grip on power until his death in 1975, after which Spain transitioned to democracy. Democracy is well established now, but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten \"pact of forgetting\" during the democratic transition and statues of Franco were removed and streets were renamed. His embalmed body currently lies at the huge Valley of the Fallen mausoleum alongside tens of thousands of victims from both sides of the civil war. But the site is reviled by many Spaniards who see it as a place dedicated to the victory of Franco's nationalist forces over their Republican opponents. It was also partly built by political prisoners, whom Franco's regime subjected to forced labour. The site is a shrine for Spain's far right who pay homage to the dictator there. It is often where Franco's supporters gather to mark the anniversary of his death. But Spain's socialist government, in power since last June, made removing Franco's remains one of its key promises. It wants the Valley of the Fallen to become \"a place of commemoration, remembrance and homage to the victims of the war\". It sees the presence of Franco's remains there as an affront to a mature democracy. Many descendants of Franco's victims support the plan to bury his remains elsewhere. But the issue has largely split public opinion across Spain. Last August, despite objections from his family and the right-wing People's and Citizens parties, the government approved the exhumation. It wanted to find a more low-key burial place where the dictator's followers would find it harder to pay tribute. But Franco's family (who would rather he wasn't moved at all) said he should lie in a family crypt in the Almudena Cathedral - right in the centre of Madrid. The government argued that the former dictator should not be placed anywhere he could be glorified. It also said there were potential security issues with the cathedral site. As it is a Catholic church, the Vatican also weighed in and backed the government's search for an alternative location. Then, last month, an appeal by Franco's family against the exhumation was thrown out by the Supreme Court. It unanimously backed the government's plan to move his remains. Franco will be reburied at El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery. The exhumation is set to start at 10:30 (08:30 GMT) on Thursday. The government wanted to carry it out before elections on 10 November and so a deadline - 25 October - was set for the exhumation. Spain's El País daily says it will be attended by a forensic scientist, relatives of Franco and Justice Minister Dolores Delgado. The cost of removing the granite slab, weighing 1.5 tonnes, is €3,090 (£2,657; $3,454), the daily reports.

The Chinese government has said the inquiry was a \"serious concern\" and has warned that it will not sit back if the US takes actions it deems unfair. But one of the biggest challenges for Mr Trump's investigation comes from his own country. Since the White House started its inquiry, a slew of US business groups have submitted formal comments describing their concerns. But just six companies have proved willing to come forward with complaints, according to the public record of comments. Many of them are smaller businesses describing already known incidents. Analysts say companies are hesitant to put at risk their access to one of the world's biggest markets by speaking out. But the decision to stay quiet has consequences: it is likely to limit the administration's ability to build a strong case against China. It may hurt the ability to identify effective remedies, while also making unilateral action more appealing to the White House. \"It's going to be a huge problem that companies are unwilling to provide specifics because it's going to be very difficult for the United States government to take effective action,\" says Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Intellectual property The White House's focus on intellectual property theft in China follows years of concerns in the US, Europe and elsewhere over counterfeit goods, piracy, hacking, patent violations and other forms of theft. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that the annual cost to the US economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225bn and $600bn. In recent years, the US says the Chinese government has encouraged some of those practices as part of its economic and national security strategies. Those involve state-backed enterprises and are focused on boosting certain industries such as aerospace, robotics and biotech. The US inquiry asked for information about topics including policies that pressure companies to share information with local business partners; opaque approval processes; and possible cyber espionage backed by the government. But previous US efforts to tackle the issue have been hindered by the hesitance of major companies to speak out, says Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \"This has been the problem,\" says Mr Levy, who served as a trade economist under former President George W Bush. \"If you want to say China has these violations and we are acting in response to that... you need to have that fairly well documented. And to do that you need to have the co-operation of the companies involved.\" Edwin Rogers is co-founder of Bonumose Biochem, a small Virginia-based start-up that was one of the six companies that shared its complaints. In his case, he says scientists in China filed a copycat patent for a process of making a healthy rare sugar - technology that he believes his company had purchased rights to after acquiring a firm last year. The scientists worked in the US for that firm, he says. They are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-backed entity, and have political connections. He says he felt a \"duty\" to come forward and hopes his story will help the White House craft a response. China's response The office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the inquiry, did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation. China maintains it has responded to concerns, pointing to laws that forbid intellectual property theft, success by western companies in Chinese courts, and its own efforts to address cyber crime. In September, after the Trump administration launched its investigation, it announced a four-month crackdown focused on intellectual property and foreign investors. In comments submitted to US investigators, Chinese organisations told the US that decisions to establish joint ventures and share technology are voluntary agreements between private companies. They cast government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, as \"promotional\" - not mandatory - programmes. Some US businesses also defend China's approach. William Mansfield is the intellectual property director at Abro Industries, a 25-person company based in Indiana that makes products such as glue and tape for sale overseas. He says he has spent years fighting against counterfeiters in China - and has figured out successful ways of using China's system, like asking for help from local authorities instead of immediately pursuing a lawsuit. He says US companies often don't understand how China works and unfairly blame problems on the government. \"I've just never seen anything that would lead me to believe it's anything other than individual counterfeiters acting to maximise their profit and not really caring about the rules,\" he says. What next? Many US analysts expect the White House to find fault with Beijing; pointing to the growing corporate involvement of the Communist Party and rules that require foreign companies in some sectors to use local partners. But it is unclear what the White House might do after that. The US could work with the Chinese government, collaborate with other countries to craft a response, bring a complaint in an international forum such as the World Trade Organisation, or take unilateral action. That risks triggering a trade war but President Trump - who has repeatedly attacked China while dismissing international pacts - may be more open to that approach, Mr Levy says. The White House China's strategy remains unclear as different advisors appear to promote clashing approaches, he adds. Investigation of Chinese steel companies, for example, has not led to action. The White House also wants Chinese cooperation as it responds to missile tests from North Korea. \"It's hard to puzzle out what they're doing,\" Mr Levy says. Business concerns US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he expects addressing the issue to take time. But he says the US is looking for immediate deals, like ones struck between Boeing and Saudi Arabia, as a sign of good faith. Many businesses remain worried the White House could damage the US relationship with China to satisfy isolationists among President Trump's supporters. Erin Ennis, of the US China Business Council, says about 20% of its members have faced pressure in China to transfer key technology in recent years, but adds that they also report that the environment in China is improving. She urges the administration to focus on specific changes in China, rather than simply imposing penalties, such as sanctions. For example, China could stop making a distinction between foreign and domestic companies, she says. Even without testimony from major companies, associations like hers have provided enough suggestions for the White House to work with the Chinese government, says Ms Ennis. But Prof Branstetter says the US will need to take stronger, more targeted action if it expects intellectual property thefts to stop. He says it doesn't have the information to do so now and he has doubts about this administration's abilities to craft an adroit response. \"It's easy to see this going badly,\" he says.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）即将访问中国，议程当中很重要的一项将是他于今年8月下达的命令：从贸易方面对中国的政策展开全面调查。"}

We even have a motivational poster that reads: \"Make a coffee, put on some gangsta rap, and handle it.\" It seems that's a view shared by our partner stations in 100 cities across 40 countries. We asked their presenters which songs they're playing to help their listeners get through the pandemic. Consider it your lockdown playlist. 1. Bop Daddy (Falz) - chosen by Ronke from Splash FM in Ibadan, Nigeria Many Nigerians are missing their nights out right now, if the #BopDaddyChallenge is anything to go by. It's a TikTok trend, Ronke explains. Those who would normally go to nightclubs have been taking to social media instead. They picture themselves transitioning from pyjamas into glamorous evening-wear - as if by magic. \"They're getting all made up… to go nowhere!\" she laughs. The soundtrack to the challenge is a tune by rapper-comedian Falz. \"It really is just a guy talking about himself, and how he's going to be your everything,\" says Ronke. \"The lyrics may not always make much sense, but the important thing is that it's fun to dance to while at home.\" 2. Everything I Wanted (Billie Eilish) - chosen by Tebogo from Gabz FM in Gaborone, Botswana Billie Eilish's sombre song recounts a nightmare in which she takes her own life - but nobody cares. It's hardly music to blast away the lockdown blues. But news reporter Tebogo insists it's an apt choice for the present time, which is why Gabz FM has been playing it loads. \"It relates to the state of mind Botswana is in,\" he says. \"There's a bit of uncertainty. You're not sure where things are going to end up. But you have no choice other than to remain hopeful.\" In her track, Eilish ultimately finds solace in those people closest to her, namely her brother Finneas. 3. Imagine (John Lennon) - chosen by Michael from Metro Plus in Hong Kong John Lennon's famous song appeals for unity and compassion. And Michael at Hong Kong's Metro Plus thinks people in Hong Kong are already showing each other more love than usual. \"You see a person without a mask by the roadside and someone will be giving him a helping hand. Before, they wouldn't have even looked at that guy,\" he says. \"This struggle is not between an Asian and an American, an American and a European, or a European and an African. \"Humans are up against something (coronavirus) we can't even see. If all we come together, as this song asks, we'll get through it.\" 4. Mulk Kay Nojawano (traditional) - chosen by Asfandyar from Power 99 in Islamabad, Pakistan Asfandyar's tricky task is to create \"positive content\" during the pandemic. His team have chosen to rework a traditional song, which he says gives people courage. \"It makes them feel like defenders. They're an army. Why? Because they're staying home, keeping themselves and their families safe.\" His playlists follow a daily rhythm. In the mornings, people want energetic pop to exercise to. By 5pm, it's time for something more reflective. \"That's when the sun sets, and we play songs like this to give them hope again for tomorrow. Music is the thing here which is calming people down.\" 5. Par Pira (BeePee) - chosen by Okeng from Radio King in Gulu, Uganda Lockdown has made radio more crucial than ever in rural northern Uganda. Okeng's breakfast show has a feel-good feature in which the station calls up two people who want to connect with each other but lack the means (pay-as-you-go phone credit) - and it's proving popular with couples. As well as dating each other via radio, Gulu's young lovers are said to be coping with their new separation by requesting an elegant Afro-fusion love song by local artist BeePee. \"The song means, 'have me in your heart during the good times, but also the bad times',\" Okeng explains. 6. Quarantine Show (Dubioza Kolektiv) - chosen by Naida from Radio Antena in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina Due to increased pressure on the internet, some of us are glad to just Skype a friend without having issues. But, miraculously, the seven members of Dubioza Kolektiv manage to use video-calling to jam out songs even while each musician stays at home. Radio Antena likes to play the best bits from these live sessions. \"Wash your hands!\" urges this eccentric (but informative) tune. Antena's mostly English-language playlist rarely gets more Balkan than the odd Dua Lipa track. But presenter Naida says the coronavirus has raised demand for Bosnian artists. \"People are listening to us all over the world. A lot of people left here during the [1992-95] war. Right now, they're missing home. They want to hear their language, and to know what's happening here.\" 7. Resistiré 2020 (David Bisbal, Vanesa Martín, Alex Ubago, and others) - chosen by Valeria from Metropolis FM in Montevideo, Uruguay Recorded back in 1988, Resistiré has re-emerged as a defiant hymn, belted out from apartment balconies in virus-hit Spain. \"It's different to a song like [Gloria Gaynor's] I Will Survive,\" says Valeria at Metropolis FM. \"It's not about saying, 'I made it'. Instead it's about saying, 'I will fight this'.\" A star-studded 2020 cover version has become her most requested song. Uruguay has not yet been badly hit by Covid-19, Valeria says, but people here are watching the rest of the world anxiously. \"A lot of them have relatives in Spain. Or they're terribly worried about family in the United States.\" 8. Ride Natty Ride (Bob Marley) - chosen by Maya from Capital Radio in Khartoum, Sudan \"The stone that the builder refuse / Shall be the head cornerstone.\" Maya loves these Bob Marley lyrics. She thinks they mean that every underdog will have its day. Protesters calling for political changes in Sudan in 2019 adopted the reggae icon as something of a \"freedom symbol\", and he remains popular with young artists and activists a year later. Many Sudanese continue to feel marginalised, Maya says. But now it's as a result of coronavirus restrictions, which could hit the country's poorest. So, she keeps playing Marley, \"no longer as a revolutionary voice, but as a calming father figure who says, 'you're going to get through this'\". 9. We Will Rock You (Queen) - chosen by Moustafa from Radio One in Baghdad, Iraq \"It's our anthem,\" says Moustafa of this 70s floor-stomper. \"Any time we face a challenge at the radio station, we have a saying: 'We will rock this; this is not a problem for us.' And the same thing goes for the listeners. Whenever they're feeling down, they always request We Will Rock You.\" For Moustafa, lockdown is further proof of how radio offers young Iraqis an escape from their daily struggles. Turns out it's therapeutic for the DJ, too. \"Just as listeners tell me their problems, I tell them mine. So, it's back and forth, which is awesome.\" 10. Rumah Kita (God Bless) - chosen by Hisa from Smart FM in Jakarta, Indonesia Translated as Our Home, this karaoke-ready tune has taken on a new meaning at Jakarta's Smart FM. Presenter Hisa is playing it for people who are ignoring social distancing restrictions. \"We want to invite them to stay at home and be observant of the rules,\" she explains. \"The song's message is all about how great Indonesia is: no matter where you go in the world, it's always more comfortable here. And, right now, it's best to stay not just in Indonesia, but in our homes.\" No official video available.", "summary": "全世界近半数人口都不得不保持着社交距离的当下，我们当中很多人会找最喜欢的歌来安慰自己。这些歌陪着我们回忆，陪着我们伤心，甚至陪着我们在封锁令下仍可以在家中起舞。"}

Careers advisers should liaise with local employers and update parents and pupils about local jobs markets and emerging industries, urge the authors. \"Uninformed family members can hinder a child's ambitions,\" they warn. Parents can sometimes \"push\" their children \"towards careers that are seen to be safe or traditional, but possibly not best suited to the individual or taking into account emerging industries\", they argue. 'Drastic changes' The authors drew on an AoC survey earlier this year and carried out in-depth interviews with parents, children and careers specialists at colleges in Barking and Dagenham, Middlesbrough and Weymouth. The survey of just over 2,000 secondary pupils in England found only 49% felt well informed about what jobs are available. The AoC says the young people interviewed wanted \"drastic changes\" to careers advice, including better links with employers, the chance to \"have a go\" at real jobs, longer-term work experience and relevant local information. The findings follow repeated warnings about weaknesses in careers advice from bodies ranging from Ofsted to the Confederation of British Industry and the Education Select Committee. In 2012 schools were given statutory responsibility for giving independent careers information to students. Before then local authorities had provided careers services to schools, mainly through local Connexions Services. The report says there is no systematic checking on the statutory duty and raises concerns that students are not getting enough information about vocational routes such as apprenticeships or courses offered in further education colleges. The researchers say the young people they interviewed were aware of career opportunities in jobs they had actually seen in their daily lives, such as teachers, police officers or hairdressers. However, they had little idea what jobs were available to them locally or which companies and industries were the largest employers. Ms Sutton said the report showed young people felt they needed \"more practical guidance\" about how to go about researching jobs and the steps they needed to take. \"It's our responsibility as adults to become better informed about the local jobs market to be able to offer more relevant realistic and timely advice.\" Government guidance A Department for Education spokesman said: \"This report underlines why we are right to be encouraging schools to involve employers in careers advice. \"Our new guidance for schools on careers makes this clear. Schools should use employers to inspire, mentor and inform young people towards their best-suited careers. \"Three-quarters of employers say work experience is at least significant when recruiting, so it is vital schools get young people real-life contact with the world of work.\" Adrian Prandle, policy adviser at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"It is no surprise that young people are unsatisfied with the level and type of careers support they receive. \"The government was absolutely reckless, especially in a period of high youth unemployment, to scrap the careers service without providing a proper replacement. \"We agree that the solution is collaborative, and partnerships between schools, colleges, employers, Job Centre Plus and others, must be widespread\".", "summary": "父母通常在子女为了职业选择中起关键作用，但是一个报告说，父母的观点往往过时而且不准确。"}

In 2014, Papua New Guinea's government amended section 42 of the constitution to add a paragraph that allowed for \"holding a foreign national under arrangements made by Papua New Guinea with another country\".

He said the person would carry out \"a root and branch review\" of how the Bank conducts market intelligence. It comes amid claims that some bank officials knew of alleged forex fixing. It has been claimed that currency traders colluded via online chatrooms and instant messaging to manipulate forex rates. During more than four hours of questioning on a variety to topics, Mr Carney said: \"This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets.\" But he said the bank had no warning of the alleged manipulation before October. The Bank currently has three deputy governors, with responsibility for monetary policy, financial stability and prudential regulation. The Treasury Committee hearing was aimed at finding out what Bank officials knew of the foreign exchange rate fixing claims. Mr Carney said he first became aware of the allegations on 16 October. And he said that within 48 hours of hearing the allegations, the Bank had called in law firm Travers Smith to conduct an independent investigation. Awareness of claims Mr Carney's appearance before the committee comes a week after the release of minutes of meetings from 2006 suggesting that some officials were aware of market manipulation then. The minutes show that a senior member of the Bank of England's staff was told of \"attempts to move the market\" at a meeting with senior foreign exchange dealers from some of the world's largest banks. However, Paul Fisher, the Bank's executive director of markets who was head of its foreign exchange division until 2009, told MPs the minutes referred to traders' complaints over difficult markets, not rigging. \"This is about traders whingeing about how difficult their life is and no one is going to have much sympathy for that,\" he said. Mr Carney also said he had no information that anyone from the Bank condoned, facilitated or took part in market manipulation. \"We can't come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England,\" he added. One Bank of England member of staff has been suspended over compliance concerns. Mr Carney told the committee the decision to suspend the person was taken by governors, and that \"we hold staff to very high standards\". 'As bad as Libor' The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, said he remained to be convinced that the Bank was on top of the forex issue. \"This is the first real test for the Bank of England's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging,\" he said.

Dressed in orange, Mr Cantlie, who in 2012 escaped an earlier kidnapping in Syria, asks why he and others have been abandoned by the US and UK governments. IS has recently killed three hostages and, in a video showing the death of UK aid worker David Haines, threatened to kill British man Alan Henning next. 'Unwinnable conflict' No IS militants are seen in the video, which is entitled \"Lend Me Your Ears\" and is addressed to the Western public. In it Mr Cantlie says other European governments have negotiated for the release of their hostages but says the US and UK have done things differently. \"After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?\" he says. He also says this is the first of several of what he calls programmes in which he will explain the philosophy of IS. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said parts of it were like a \"kind of parody of a chat show\" and \"very much a propaganda video\". \"It doesn't end with any overt threat. He's reading from a script, there's no knife or gun being held to his head,\" our correspondent said. He added that previous IS videos were directed at US and UK leaders, but this was meant for the British public, particularly Muslims. The message of the video is that IS has been \"misrepresented by the Western media\", and the hostage says he is going to be revealing the truth about IS in \"the coming programmes\", our correspondent added. From comments on the tape, it is clear it was made this year, but not precisely when. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg described IS as a \"murderous, medieval, terrorist outfit\". \"We didn't need any reminding that what we're dealing with here in Isil is a movement of almost unprecedented barbarity and cynicism,\" said Mr Clegg, who has not yet seen the video. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he would \"look very closely\" at any material released on the internet. He said videos such as these could be \"very distressing\" to the families of the individuals involved. Who is John Cantlie? The video featuring Mr Cantlie has been released nearly a week after footage depicting the death of Mr Haines, the first British hostage to be killed. It was in that video that the life of Mr Henning, 47, from Salford, was threatened. Mr Henning was a volunteer on an aid convoy in December 2013 when he was seized just after crossing into Syria. Earlier, British Muslim leaders called for his immediate release, saying anyone undertaking a humanitarian act should be held in the highest esteem. The video of Mr Haines's death followed the killings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - which were also shown in videos - in August and earlier this month respectively. On Tuesday, IS released a separate video, which was described by analysts as a video response to US air strikes. The slickly produced, Hollywood-style trailer for a film entitled \"Flames of War\" refers to US President Barack Obama's insistence that US combat troops would not be returning to fight in Iraq. In an apparent taunt, it depicts wounded US troops, masked executioners standing over kneeling captives, and declares at the conclusion: \"Fighting has just begun.\"", "summary": "伊斯兰国组织公布了新的录像，其中显示一名英国男子已被该组织扣押为人质。"}

Eighteen women were taken off one plane - among them two British women and 13 Australian citizens - but not all were ultimately examined. Qatar's government apologised and said the baby was safe in medical care. It said the baby girl had been found in a plastic bag, buried under rubbish, prompting an \"immediate search for the parents, including on flights in the vicinity of where the newborn was found\". \"While the aim of the urgently-decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the State of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveller caused by this action,\" a statement read.

A spokesperson from the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said they were \"providing ongoing support to two British women\" following the incident. \"We have formally expressed our concern with the Qatari authorities and Qatar Airways, and are seeking assurances an unacceptable incident like this cannot happen again.\" Australia said it was receiving assistance from Qatar and co-ordinating efforts with \"two or three\" other nations whose citizens were affected. Australian alarm The invasive searches came to light this week after passengers contacted authorities in Australia. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Wednesday that women on 10 flights had been subjected to examinations. Beyond the 13 Australians, she did not reveal the nationalities of other women affected. Australian media have previously reported that all adult women who had boarded one plane from Doha to Sydney were ordered to disembark. They were taken to an ambulance on the tarmac and told to remove their underwear before being examined. Many were distressed afterwards and had received health support from the Australian government, witnesses said. On Monday, Australia's foreign ministry said reports had indicated the incident was \"beyond circumstances in which the women could give free and informed consent\". But it declined to label it sexual assault while awaiting further details from Qatari officials. Opposition politicians in Australia have called it sexual assault. Australia has also referred the matter to its federal police. Australia's foreign department secretary Frances Adamson told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that an Australian diplomatic official had been on the flight heading to Sydney. She was not subjected to an exam, but reported the incident to the ministry immediately. \"I was incredulous that this could have happened,\" Ms Adamson told the hearing. \"This is not - by any standard - normal behaviour and the Qataris recognise that, are appalled by it, do not want it to happen again.\" In its statement, Qatar said it was committed to ensuring the safety, security and comfort of travellers transiting through the country.

The US reportedly intercepted al-Qaeda messages and will shut at least 21 embassies and consulates on Sunday. Interpol issued a separate global security alert, citing jail breaks linked to al-Qaeda in nine countries. The international policing organisation said \"hundreds of terrorists\" had been freed during breakouts in countries including Iraq, Libya and Pakistan in the past month. Interpol said al-Qaeda was suspected of \"involvement in several of the breakouts\" and asked its 190 member states to help \"determine whether any of these recent events are co-ordinated or linked\". 'Viable plot' The British embassy in Yemen had already been operating with a reduced staff \"due to increased security concerns\". A Foreign Office spokesman said the closure was a \"precautionary measure\" and would not say if it was due to a specific threat, but a number of British embassies in the Middle East have been warned about increased risks. Security analyst Peter Bergen said militant group al-Qaeda had previously showed \"strong interest in launching attacks\" on the 27th day of Ramadan, which is on Sunday. Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, which monitors threats from al-Qaeda, told the BBC he believed US authorities had intercepted communications \"between senior al-Qaeda leaders talking about an operational and clearly viable plot against an embassy\". The claim was reported by the New York Times. Mr Simcox said it was unclear which embassy was to be targeted, but Yemen is a high-risk country because al-Qaeda's \"most active franchise\" is based in the Arabian Peninsula and the US has stepped up drone attacks in Yemen in recent days. He said there had been a \"lull\" in the drone attacks in Yemen in the past two months, and said the sudden increase suggested the latest threat was \"emanating from Yemen itself\". Hundreds of Britons are thought to be living in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We keep travel advice and the security of our staff and missions under constant review. \"Our travel advice advises particular vigilance during Ramadan, when tensions could be heightened. We are particularly concerned about the security situation in the final days of Ramadan and into Eid.\" The Islamic holy month ends next week. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: \"The government must also now urgently review security at Britain's other postings in the region given moves by other countries to withdraw staff for their security.\" 'Leave now' Iona Craig, the Times' correspondent in Yemen, said very few British people now remain in the country, mostly working for the embassy, charities, UN organisations and oil companies. She said \"the threat to foreigners here has definitely increased\" in recent months. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme British embassy staff in Yemen now live on-site, following two attacks in 2010. On its website, the Foreign Office was already advising against all travel to Yemen and urging British nationals to \"leave now\". It says there is \"a high threat from terrorism throughout Yemen\" and \"a very high threat of kidnap from armed tribes, criminals and terrorists\". Unlike the US, the UK is keeping its embassies in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Iraq open, but it has advised staff to \"exercise extra vigilance\". In a statement, the US state department said: \"Current information suggests that al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August.\" The US issued a global travel alert on Friday, saying al-Qaeda was planning attacks. BBC state department correspondent Kim Ghattas said it was \"not unusual\" for the US to issue travel warnings, but said \"this one is both wide-ranging and somewhat specific\".", "summary": "在美国发布全球恐怖袭击警告后， 英国决定暂时关闭在也门的大使馆，同时通知另外几个国家的大使馆要高度戒备。"}

It has spread to more than 50 countries but the vast majority of infections and deaths are in China, where the virus originated late last year. Nasa scientists said the reduction in levels of nitrogen dioxide - a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles and industrial facilities - was first apparent near the source of the outbreak in Wuhan city but then spread across the country. Nasa compared the first two months of 2019 with the same period this year. The space agency noted that the decline in air pollution levels coincided with restriction imposed on transportation and business activities, and as millions of people went into quarantine. \"This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,\" Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. She added that she had observed a decline in nitrogen dioxide levels during the economic recession in 2008, but said that decrease was more gradual.

But it decided that lions, tigers and elephants no longer \"have a place\". The government wants wild animals banned from circuses from December 2015, with fines of up to £5,000 imposed on owners who flout the law. The decision followed a long campaign led by Conservative MP Mark Pritchard. But the committee raised doubts over whether the ban, as laid out in the government's draft parliamentary bill, might be challenged under European law. 'Best interests' It also looked at the relationship between circuses and other forms of entertainment involving animals, saying: \"It is not clear that there is a material difference between those who keep wild birds for falconry displays and those who keep such birds for displays in a circus. \"Nor is the difference clear between having a display involving a raccoon in a circus or a raccoon in an act on Britain's Got Talent.\" The report added that separating some domesticated animals deemed \"wild\", such as raccoons, from their lifelong keeper or trainer might not be in their \"best interests\". There are currently 21 licensed wild animals working in two circuses in England, including camels, zebras and snakes, but not elephants, monkeys, gorillas, chimpanzees or big cats. The committee's chairwoman, Conservative MP Anne McIntosh, said: \"The committee agrees with the government that the days when it was appropriate to have animals like lions or elephants travelling with circuses are long past, but the ban proposed in draft legislation goes too far in restricting the type of animals which travelling circuses might use. \"We believe that there should be a ban on big cat species and elephants, but it is possible to argue that, for example, camels, zebra or snakes can continue to have a place in the travelling circus.\" The issue was highlighted last November, when circus owner Bobby Roberts was found guilty of mistreating a 58-year-old elephant called Anne. But Miss McIntosh said: \"The government itself accepts that there is no overwhelming welfare case for a ban on wild animals in travelling circumstances, and there is already legislation to deal with any welfare abuse, such as the case involving Anne the Asian elephant last year. \"There is also a regulation system in place since the beginning of this year, and we believe that the government should narrow the provisions of the draft bill and include a proscribed list of animals that can no longer be used in travelling circuses.\" Prior to the ban coming into force, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has introduced a \"tough licensing scheme\" it claims will \"ensure the welfare of wild animals.\" The government invited the committee to scrutinise its draft parliamentary bill.

She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday. She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US. 'Depth of experience' Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a \"dove\", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation. Her nomination has been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats. As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles. Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts. On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice. \"Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them,\" John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement. \"This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy.\" Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: \"I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.\" \"We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.\" 'Battle tested' But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation \"by a wide margin\". The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had \"a depth of experience that is second to none\". \"I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman,\" he added. The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be \"seamless\" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together. \"I don't think there's going to be a radical change,\" she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus. Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was \"terrific news\". \"We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important,\" she said. \"Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate.\" A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was \"battle tested\" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.", "summary": "白宫官员说，奥巴马总统将提名联邦储备局副主席詹妮特·耶伦担任下届央行总裁。"}

The 22-year-old woman, from Hackney, has refused to remove her niqab and reveal her face in front of any man. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing. The judge's ruling means that if the woman, who started wearing a veil in May 2012, refuses to comply during her trial she could be jailed for contempt of court. The only part of a niqab-wearer's face that is visible is a narrow section across the eyes. The judge said he would offer the woman a screen to shield her from public view while giving evidence but that she had to be seen by him, the jury and lawyers. At other times during the trial the woman will be allowed to keep her face covered while sitting in the dock. 'Elephant in courtroom' In the ruling Judge Murphy said: \"The ability of the jury to see the defendant for the purposes of evaluating her evidence is crucial.\" Referring to the woman as \"D\", he said he had \"no reason to doubt the sincerity of her belief\" and his decision would have been the same if she had worn the niqab for years. He said that \"the niqab has become the elephant in the courtroom\" and there was widespread anxiety among judges over how to tackle the issue. He added he hoped \"Parliament or a higher court will provide a definite answer to the issue soon\". Judge Murphy said: \"If judges in different cases in different places took differing approaches [to the niqab] the result would be judicial anarchy.\" The woman's defence barrister Susan Meek had argued the woman's human right to express her faith through her attire would be breached if she was ordered to remove her veil. When asked if there would be an appeal against the decision, the woman's lawyer said she and her client would \"consider our options\". At a previous hearing, the issue of her identity was resolved when the woman removed her veil in private for a female police officer. Judge Murphy's ruling comes as Liberal Democrat Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was \"uneasy\" about restricting freedoms and called for a national debate on the state's role in stopping veils being imposed on girls. Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said he believed it was \"vital\" defendants' faces were visible at \"all times\" and said he \"regretted\" the judge's decision.

This year, the parliament is expected to rubberstamp major constitutional changes that will elevate the power of President Xi Jinping. It will also confirm dropping China's two-term presidential limit. That would mean Xi Jinping could stay in power for life, leading China according to his new ideological guidelines, known as \"Xi Jinping Thought\". Here's what will go on during the sessions. Who is meeting? The National People's Congress (NPC). That's the legislature or parliament. Think the House of Commons in the UK, or the US House of Representatives. According to the constitution, the NPC is the most powerful state organ - but it's often labelled a \"rubber-stamp\" body by international observers, meaning it will always approve what it's told to approve. This year, the NPC has 2,980 deputies representing China's provinces, autonomous regions, centrally-administered municipalities, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and the armed forces. Among those are 742 women - that's around 25% this time, more than the last NPC - and also 438 ethnic minority deputies. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). That's the most powerful political advisory body. Think House of Lords or the US Senate. The CPPCC is strictly advisory in nature - it does not have any legislative power. The current CPPCC has 2,158 members, including people from entertainment, sports, science, business and non-Communist parties. Referred to as the \"two sessions\" (liang hui), these meetings traditionally last between one and two weeks. This year the CPPCC started on 3 March and the NPC will start on 5 March. What can we expect? The \"two sessions\" have special significance this year as they come after the once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress of October 2017. That congress saw an unprecedented cementing of power for President Xi, elevating him on the same level as the country's inaugural communist leader Mao Zedong. The NPC is expected to: The \"two sessions\" will also look at any plans for economic reform, as well as Mr Xi's other two focus areas: corruption and protecting the environment. Meanwhile, the CPPCC will review past policies of central and local governments and formulate plans for the future. Economic issues will be a key focus as 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up policy. Will there be any opposition? Don't expect too many surprises at what some describe as Asia's largest political pantomime. Whatever will be decided or debated usually is pre-determined by the Communist Party. There have been instances, though, where the NPC did raise objections. In 2006 for instance, the government deferred a property tax law after it sparked a debate in the NPC. Commonly referred to as a one party state, China does in fact have several other official parties alongside the Communists. Largely dismissed inside and outside the country as mere democratic window dressing, these parties unanimously support the Communists within the NPC. How is it viewed in China? Chinese state media are giving extensive coverage to the two sessions but you won't find any criticism undermining the two assemblies as mere rubber stamp groups. China Radio International praises the fact the \"long-awaited revamping of state institutions\" will be high on the NPC's agenda. Beijing-based website China Finance Online lists sustainable industrial growth, building on benefits from the Belt and Road initiative and poverty alleviation as the key themes for the meetings. Meanwhile, dissident media such as US-based NTDTV.com report that petitioners from several provinces are heading to Beijing to highlight their grievances. In a tradition dating back to imperial times, each year, petitioners stream into the capital to seek justice by appealing to the country's rulers. During the two sessions, they are usually kept out of the public eye so as to not disrupt the political theatre. But there has been some criticism also within China of the proposal to end the presidency term limit. Li Datong has urged lawmakers to vote against this proposal. \"It [two-term limit on the presidency introduced in the 1982 constitution] was the highest and most effective legal restriction meant to prevent autocracy or putting individuals above the party and the state\", the former editor of state-run China Youth Daily said in an open letter to the legislators. He told the BBC such a move would be \"considered a farce in Chinese history in the future\". Reporting by Tilak Jha, BBC Monitoring.

The figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. Human activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. Dr Mike Barrett. head of science and policy at WWF, said: \"It's pretty clear under 'business as usual' we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now we've reached a point where there isn't really any excuse to let this carry on. \"We know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations - it really is now down to us to act.\" However the methodology of the report has been criticised. The Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the world's wildlife. This analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles - about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. The team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. Any species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. The researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. Some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. The last report, published in 2014, estimated that the world's wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. This assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. Dr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. \"We do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment - for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example.\" It also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. The researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. Dr Robin Freeman, head of ZSL's Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: \"But that's assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures - overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example - increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. \"But one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations - they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.\" However, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. \"There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy,\" he told BBC News. \"For example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. \"When you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchier... there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. \"They're trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number.... It's flawed.\" But Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. \"It's completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But that's because there is a lack of data. \"We're confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. \"It's entirely possible that species that aren't being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse - but I'd be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. \" Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle", "summary": "伦敦动物学会最新发布的生命地球指数显示，全球野生动物数量自1970年以来已锐减58%。"}

And he says that further progress in science and technology will create \"new ways things can go wrong\". Prof Hawking is giving this year's BBC Reith Lectures, which explore research into black holes, and his warning came in answer to audience questions. He says that assuming humanity eventually establishes colonies on other worlds, it will be able to survive. \"Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years. \"By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race. \"However, we will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period.\" Reith Lectures: Prof Stephen Hawking Prof Hawking's first Reith Lecture will be broadcast on 26 January and on 2 February at 9am on BBC Radio 4. BBC World Service listeners can tune in on 26 January at 15:06 GMT and 2 February at 15:06 GMT or catch up online via www.bbc.com/worldserviceradio BBC News online will be publishing the text of Prof Hawking's lectures with accompanying notes by our science editor, David Shukman. iWonder: A brief history of Stephen Hawking It is ironic that such a prominent figure in science identifies scientific progress itself as the major source of new threats. On previous occasions, he has highlighted the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming powerful enough to cause the extinction of the human race. But he insists that ways will be found to cope. \"We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognise the dangers and control them. I'm an optimist, and I believe we can.\" Asked for advice for young scientists, Prof Hawking said they should retain a sense of wonder about \"our vast and complex\" Universe. \"From my own perspective, it has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. There is nothing like the Eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before.\" But he also said that future generations of researchers should be aware of how scientific and technological progress is changing the world, and to help the wider public understand it. \"It's important to ensure that these changes are heading in the right directions. In a democratic society, this means that everyone needs to have a basic understanding of science to make informed decisions about the future. \"So communicate plainly what you are trying to do in science, and who knows, you might even end up understanding it yourself.\" Since his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, Prof Hawking's determination to overcome the immense physical challenges of his disability has been a source of worldwide admiration and fascination. His daughter Lucy, a journalist and writer, who has co-written children's science books with Prof Hawking, was asked to explain his drive. \"I think he's enormously stubborn and has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going,\" she said. \"But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival, but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work, writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities, and being a family man, a friend and a colleague to so many people and keeping up with friends across the world.\" Follow David on Twitter.", "summary": "英国著名科学家霍金警告，人类一手造成的一系列东西可能给自身的生存带来威胁。"}

Here is a snapshot of 63 of your memories, one for each year of her reign. 1. 2. I met the Queen in 2000. I handed her a bunch of sweet peas that I picked from my garden. She said thank you and Prince Phillip gave me a wink! James Townson, Preston, England 3. I met the Queen in 1999 in Portsmouth for an Easter parade. I gave her the biggest egg and she asked me if there were any jewels inside. I just shook my head not really knowing what to say! Natasha Standley, Portsmouth, England 4. 5. I was four, I still remember having to practise curtsying before giving her some flowers. Jessica Mullett, Plymouth, England 6. I was two feet away from Her Majesty and I just pointed and shouted \"Oh my [expletive] god, it's the Queen!\" Mark Malik, London, England 7. 8. I was 10 when the Queen came to Paris in 1957. I remember she wore a blue dress with a hat that looked like a bathing cap. Alain Roger-Ravily, Paris, France 9. I met the Queen when I was at school at RAF Marham. My mum and dad had lunch with her. Apparently she eats slowly because when she finishes, they clear away everyone's plates! Barney Durrant, East Grinstead, England 10. 11. I was three or four. I ran up and gave her some flowers. My mum told me off because I didn't curtsy, but I pointed out I was wearing dungarees so couldn't. Heather Emerton, Bournemouth, England 12. I was in Pennsylvania to see the Liberty Bell. A man in a suit with an ear phone walked up to me and requested I leave as the Queen was going to view the bell. I was shocked and preceded down to the corner of the road. At this point a limousine stopped where I was standing as the Queen was right next to me. Robert Eldridge, Florida, US 13. I had been told not to look at the Queen when she speaks to you, but I just couldn't help it because she spoke to me! Henry Tavoa, Port Villa, Vanuatu 14. 15. Jo-Ann Mandat from Ontario, Canada was dancing at a show in Toronto in the 1980s when she met the Queen. After the show she said Prince Philip offered to take her back to England in his suitcase! 16. I was invited to an afternoon tea at Margam Abbey with Her Majesty and some 400 guests. She came in looking rather tired, looked straight at me and broke into a wide grin. Megan, Cheshire, England 17. 18. I met Her Majesty during a private audience. It was an amazing experience to sit and chat with her in Buckingham Palace. She clearly had a genuine interest in and concern for my regiment - The Calgary Highlanders. Russ Meades, Victoria, Canada 19. We played \"Isn't she lovely\" by Stevie Wonder as she arrived at Burton Train Station in 1977. She stopped and told us our playing was lovely. Ed, originally from Barton under Needwood, England 20. We travelled out to the highway from our house on Lake Muskoka to see the Queen and Prince Philip during their 1959 tour of Canada. I remember them waving at us as they drove by. Elvina Campbell, Toronto, Canada 21. 22. Anna Powell from Manchester, England says she was almost run over by the Queen as a five-year-old, while walking with her parents in Windsor Great Park in 1985. 23. Rosie Atkins met the Queen at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2000, when a borrowed mobile phone rang in her pocket. The Queen said: \"You had better answer that, it might be someone important!\" 24. I met her as a Girl Guide. She asked \"How many badges have you got?\" I was completely flustered and answered \"Lots! I have lots more at home too!\" It was the worst answer in history. Erin Jackson, Dumfries, Scotland 25. 26. On returning to the US after a trip to England, the passport officer asked if I had met the Queen. When I said yes, he was astonished. He told me he asked everyone who went through his line after a trip to the UK and I was the first to say yes. Carol Williamson, Pennsylvania, US 27. I met the Queen when I was teaching at Llanelli Boys Grammar School. I stood very close to her and was surprised that she was about my height, so not very tall! Pamela Evans, Swansea, Wales 28. We were told if Her Majesty stops to speak to you, reply \"Mam\" or \"Your Majesty\". As the Queen approached sure enough I hear: \"How long have you been in the army?\" Proudly I say: \"Three years sir!\" Kenny Owen via Facebook 29. 30. I met the Queen on a state visit to Brunei Darussalam. Upon leaving I heard her say to the sultan: \"Well toodle-pip! If you are in London, do drop in.\" Richard Harbord, Norfolk, England 31. Jack Irwin from Dublin met the Queen when she visited Ireland in 2011. \"She wished me the best of luck with my studies, while the Duke was his cheeky self getting laughs galore with his commentary.\" 32. 33. In the autumn of 2005 she visited the hospital where I was working and wanted to meet staff caring for patients after 7/7. She was softly spoken, very chatty and quite knowledgeable. Michaela Davies, Bromley, England 34. The smile she gave me was that of a grandma who hadn't seen her grandchild for 20 years. It lit up the room says Dr Julia Malkin from Leicester on receiving her MBE in 2011. 35. I met the Queen when I was an acting student. After the performance she asked me how long the play was going to run, I spluttered out \"Two years... I mean months... weeks!\" She looked at me as if I were completely deranged, smiled and passed graciously on. Hayward Morse, England and Canada 36. 37. Her Majesty visited Delhi and inaugurated a 14ft high ceramic mural I designed. I spoke to her at length. My encounter was recorded in a video, which, at the time, I could not afford to buy. Sumita Sinha, London, England 38. We all got a big smile from the Queen when she visited Maltby Comprehensive School in 1977 during the Silver Jubilee tour. Barry Porteus, Doncaster, England 39. Can you lie to a Queen? Paul Harman from St Albans faced that dilemma: \"The Queen asked me if the rose I had given her came from my garden. It hadn't - someone in the crowd had given it to me to pass to her. Can I lie to the Queen and say yes? Because otherwise I'd have to admit I hadn't brought anything to give her!\" 40. 41. Elisa Boccara comments on Facebook that she saw the Queen driving around in the grounds in Windsor, she added \"I did not meet her as such but still it was cool\". 42. I had the honour of seeing the Queen up close during the parade when she visited Bromley High Street in Kent. It was a surreal moment seeing her in reality rather than on a TV screen. Rebecca East, Bromley, England 43. Jessica Ferris's dad wrote about their meeting with the Queen. Jessica and her sister started wailing in stereo just as the Queen walked past on a visit to Portsmouth. The Queen gave a look and a sympathetic smile that only a mother can give. 44. 45. I was in the Cubs in Shetland when she came to visit. I really wanted to speak to her so we had a conversation about my friend's dad's hang-gliding accident. She was incredibly polite and listened to the story. Neil Ruddiforth, Balmedie, Scotland 46. I had no idea where England was, or who Elizabeth was. But I figured that the beautiful lady I saw for a few fleeting moments in a cavalcade in Kolkata must be the one who everybody was waiting to see. Basistha Basu, Kolkata, India 47. Roger Davey met the Queen in Adelaide, Australia said \"After meeting her I wanted to explore beyond the very remote sheep ranch that had been my life up to that point.\" 48. 49. I welcomed the Queen to a state banquet in 1995 hosted by President Nelson Mandela at The Cape Sun Intercontinental Hotel in Cape Town where I was managing director. Harry Murray, Bath, England 50. Annette Holden said on Facebook that she had met the Royal Family on many occasions: \"In the mid to late 1970s my parents ran the King's Head in Great Bircham, near Sandringham. There was a Lodge on our grounds they used for shooting parties.\" 51. We were out on my great aunt's front yard when the Queen and Prince Philip drove past. She waved, we waved, it was all very exciting. Sheree Adams, Austin, Texas, US 52. 53. On the anniversary of the Falklands War Her Majesty visited Pangbourne College where I was a student as it holds the memorial chapel. She came up and asked about our military uniforms. Calum Steele, Oxford, England 54. While we were waiting to meet the Queen, a plain-clothed policewoman, presumably trying to entertain me while we were waiting, showed me her gun in her bag. I was terrified. But I do remember my brother gave her some flowers and she said \"thank you young man\". Emma Heron, Bristol, England 55. The Queen came to our school's quarter centenary in 1984. At the time I was the editor of the \"Alternative\" which was the school's magazine. She asked: \"Is it scandalous?\" Simon Clark, near Cambridge, England 56. 57. I met the Queen during her state visit Hull in 2008. I was part of the \"Royal Guard\" presented by Hull Trinity House School, as a member of the school. Sam Piercy, Hull, England 58. When the Queen was introduced to me she responded \"Oh we have a Commonwealth Association of Architects too?\" Tony Godwin former executive director for the Commonwealth Association of Architects. 59. 60. I was chosen to be the staff representative in the Letters to the Future project, where 800 people wrote letters to be opened on the 900th anniversary, it was part of the Queen's visit to the University of Cambridge's 800th year celebrations. Rebecca Holmes, Cambridge, England 61. I remember how exciting it was to see her close up. I have had a countdown to her becoming the longest-reigning British monarch on my phone. Suzie Rishworth, Hampshire, England 62. 63. And finally... Carol Boyd hasn't met the Queen yet but she's hopeful: \"I'm hoping to see her open the Borders Railway on 9th September (when she becomes the longest reigning British monarch).\" Watch this space!

It is further evidence of a difficult start to the year for retailers. Consumer confidence also slipped back in February, the latest survey from Nationwide indicated, largely due to concerns about employment prospects. There was an increase in the number of respondents describing their economic situation as bad. \"Consumers also scaled back their expectations for the future, with the forward-looking aspects of the index weakening during the month,\" said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner. New figures from the Bank of England, also released on Friday, back this up. Cautious consumers are choosing to pay off credit cards and loans, rather than take on new borrowing, the data indicate. Evans Cycles, one of the UK's biggest bike retailers, told the BBC's Today programme that it was having to be very conscious about prices. \"We are peddling into a headwind in terms of the consumer economy,\" said chief executive Nick Wilkinson. \"Confidence remains low, getting people to spend money on a bike is about persuading them that it is value for money.\" However, Nationwide added that the number of consumers planning to buy household goods - an indicator of confidence - was higher in February than a year earlier. This reflects official retail sales data for the month, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday. Sales volumes declined by a larger-than-expected 0.8% in February, the ONS said. But they were still 1% higher than a year earlier. 'Damaged' High Streets The Local Data Company said the rise in empty premises was \"not unexpected\" as retailers continue to cut back and even go bust. Game, which has 600 High Street branches in the UK, said this week that it was going into administration after key suppliers stopped doing business with them. It is continuing to trade while it tries to find a solution to its debt problems. \"It is a timely reminder to the government, who are due to respond to the Portas Review this month, of the significant challenges facing town and city centres up and down the country,\" said LDC director Matthew Hopkinson. Retail consultant and TV presenter Mary Portas was asked by the government to look at ways to revitalise struggling town centres. Her report, published in December 2011, recommended cutting regulations and proposed a bigger role for street markets in town centres. \"It's crucial that the government responds to Mary's review with a menu of recommendations next week that local people, councils and businesses can 'pick and mix' to help start to reverse the damage that many of our high streets have suffered,\" said Ian Fletcher, director of policy at the British Property Federation. \"Our high streets need vision, trade and investment, and landlords therefore welcomed a key recommendation from the Portas report in December that allows property owners to match the funding that retailers put in to Business Improvement Districts - successful vehicles that allow traders to come together to plan and fund improvements in their area.\" Currently, only retailers can contribute to Business Improvement Districts. It will require a change in the law to allow landlords to take part in these initiatives, which are currently funded by increases in business rates. The government said it would publish a full response shortly and pointed to the competition it had already started a competition to give 12 town centres the chance to receive help and funding as \"Portas Pilots\". \"We have also scrapped Whitehall rules that instructed councils to hike parking charges, given councils new powers to cut business rates for local firms, and doubled small business rate relief, which will help half a million small firms for the next two and a half years,\" said Local Government Minister Grant Shapps. Rent strain Retailers' quarterly rent bills are due this weekend. It is a large upfront cost that has prompted retailers to go into administration in the past. For example, Game's failure to raise enough money to pay its looming multi-million pound rent bill was behind its decision to file for administration. There have been calls to allow shop owners to pay monthly, rather than quarterly, in order to try to ease the strain. \"Retailers really need it from a cash perspective,\" said retail property consultant Jonathan de Mello. \"Landlords need to do more and be more creative in the way they do things,\" he said.", "summary": "英国零售业仍难走出低迷。新的数据显示，英国店铺的空置率达三年来最高水平，二月份创下14.6%的空置率新高。"}

The survey shows a sharp downturn in jobs in banking and finance. \"The current graduate market is the story of the economy, stagnant in places with growth in some areas,\" says the AGR's Stephen Isherwood. The president of the National Union of Students, Toni Pearce, said: \"While some areas are performing better than others it's clear that those leaving education face ever greater competition for jobs.\" This latest view of the graduate jobs market, based on 200 employers, suggests a mixed picture, with some recruitment areas getting tougher, while others are improving. 'Pockets of growth' Engineering, energy and telecommunications are all identified as areas of the jobs market with increasing numbers of vacancies. There were also \"pockets of growth\" outside London, says the report, including in the south-east of England, the West Midlands and Scotland. Salary levels continue to stagnate - and the highest median starting pay level remains in London at £28,500. Laura Thomas, who recently graduated from Glasgow University, is currently working in a bar. She told the BBC many university leavers are finding it difficult to get a place on graduate recruitment schemes. \"It's incredibly frustrating and I know from experience that many of my peers have decided to stay in education rather than face the bleak situation that is the jobs market.\" Ms Thomas, who studied history and politics, said that the vacancies available might not match the qualifications held by graduates. \"Not everyone wants to be an engineer or in telecommunications. What are we supposed to do with our degrees?\" 'The right industry' But employer David Priestman from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire said there might be high numbers of applicants, but too many of them had unrealistic expectations and lacked the right skills. \"The problem is that today's graduates want the dream jobs. However, unless you have good contacts or an exceptional degree, it isn't going to happen,\" he said. Ben Smith from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said university leavers needed to think more about \"choosing the right industry\". \"I graduated this year with a degree in computer security. I managed to secure two job interviews and was offered both positions. I chose the right position for me and my prospects.\" Stephen Isherwood, the new AGR chief executive, said: \"Overall vacancies are slightly down on last year and there is no salary growth. However we can take comfort in the fact that the graduate recruitment industry is still investing heavily in their graduate intakes. \"On the positive side of things, retailers, consulting and engineering firms, utilities and IT and telecoms companies are all recruiting more graduates. \"With these results in mind, my message to students is do not despair; graduate employers are broadly hiring the same number of graduates as they did before the credit crunch hit. Be competitive and strategic in your approach to applications - and keep persevering.\" This mid-year survey, with its picture of a graduate jobs market still struggling to recover, is less optimistic than another recent survey of 100 employers from High Fliers, which found that vacancies were bouncing back to their highest levels since the recession. That survey, on a smaller sample of employers, had found there were 4.6% more vacancies than last year.", "summary": "今年夏天毕业的大学生将面临更严峻的就业形势。据预测，向毕业生提供的职位空缺下降4%。"}

She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. In the video, Mr Spacey speaks in Frank Underwood's accent and addresses the viewer directly, much like he did throughout his five seasons on House of Cards. \"Of course some believed everything,\" he says. \"They're just waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all.\" \"They're going to say I'm being disrespectful, not playing by the rules,\" he adds. \"Like I ever played by anyone's rules before. I never did. And you loved it.\" Frank Underwood was the power-hungry and conniving protagonist of the Netflix series, and murdered a journalist and a politician before he was killed off ahead of season six. The three-minute clip, which is titled Let Me Be Frank, marks Mr Spacey's first public appearance since the first allegation of sexual assault was made against him last November. He was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of making a sexual advance in 1986 and a number of other allegations have since emerged. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event but publicly apologised before issuing an \"absolute\" denial of the other allegations. Separately, in September, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Mr Spacey would not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around his time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to Mr Spacey being axed from a number of roles, including from House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him.

There are now four times as many vegans in the UK as there were four years ago. So how hard is it to convert, and what are the potential health benefits? Veganism: Why is it on the up? Why I gave up being vegan Going vegan: Is it just a fad? What does a healthy vegan diet look like? For the latest series of Trust Me I'm A Doctor, Dr Giles Yeo decided to try it for a month and see if it was a lifestyle he could imagine adopting. As Dr Yeo quickly discovered, one of the tricky things about going vegan is that many products that don't sound as if they have anything to do with animals actually do. Eggs, cheese and meat are obvious no-nos but so is mayonnaise (contains eggs), some pastas (ditto), and wine (some alcoholic drinks use fish bones or proteins from other animals as part of the production process). As well as making sure you are not accidentally consuming animal products, one of the main challenges of going vegan is to make sure you're not missing out on any key nutrients. Following a vegan diet puts you at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D, which is needed for bone health. To get this through diet, vegans may need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals. You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement. Iodine deficiency is very common in the UK, particularly among young women. Cow's milk is our main source of iodine and non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk, have much lower levels. You can get iodine from seaweed (though the amounts are unpredictable) but you will probably need to take a supplement. The other big concern is getting enough vitamin B12. You won't find it in seeds, nuts or vegetables, so vegans and vegetarians will need to stock up with fortified breakfast cereal or nutritional yeast. Does it work? Will going vegan make you healthier? A recent analysis, which pulled together the results of 10 previous studies comparing the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of omnivores, suggests it will. The researchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer, though there was no difference in all-cause mortality. In other words, being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with being healthier but not necessarily with living longer. I say \"associated with\" because these were not the gold standard randomised controlled studies, where you take a large group of people and randomly allocate them to being vegan or omnivorous and see what happens. Such studies would be very hard to do. Instead, they compare people who are vegans with meat eaters and look for differences. Since vegans are likely to be more health conscious than the general population, it is possible that the health differences have nothing to do with the diet itself. So how did Dr Yeo get on? After being vegan for a month he had lost 4kg and brought in his belt by a notch. Along with the fall in his belly fat, his cholesterol also fell by 12%. So will he keep it up? \"I've been pleasantly surprised,\" he said, \"and though I don't plan to go vegan entirely, from now on I'll try and do at least a few days every month. \"I have to admit I was apprehensive about going vegan for a month, but once I learned a few recipes I was fine and I actually ended up enjoying it. For me, the key was not to cook vegan versions of meals that I would normally eat with meat, but to opt for recipes that were designed to be vegan in the first place. \"What I missed most while on the diet was eggs - I actually expected to miss meat a lot more.\" If you want to find out more about the benefits and risks of going vegan visit Trust Me I'm A Doctor.", "summary": "近几年来素食主义逐渐形成风潮，主要是由于人们开始注意自己的健康，并关心动物的权益和环境意识。"}

It added this measure or productivity had grown by 1.3% in the year to the end of March, the fastest rate of growth since the start of 2012. But productivity across the whole economy fell slightly, it added. On Tuesday, the ONS revised UK economic growth up 0.5 percentage points for the year to the end of March to 2.9% and said the economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year. Official figures last month showed unemployment in the UK had fallen to 1.81 million and average wages rose at their fastest rate in four years. The ONS tends to focus on output per hour as its main measure of productivity, claiming it is a more comprehensive way of measuring output.. It also looks at unit labour costs - the cost to companies of employing staff - as well as the number of available jobs, workers and hours worked. Output per hour expresses the amount produced by a company after all its costs have been stripped out. The more efficient, or productive, the company, the greater its level of output per hour. But the ONS said output per hour remained 1% lower on average in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the same period in 2008. It said productivity remained \"exceptionally weak\" across many industries. Output per hour in services - other than financial services - has grown by about 0.2% per quarter since the first three months of 2009, compared with 0.5% per quarter before the economic downturn. Productivity puzzle Output per hour in manufacturing has expanded at an average quarterly rate of around 0.3% since the start of 2009, compared with almost 1% per quarter before that. The Bank of England has consistently referred to the UK's productivity problem and it is a key concern for the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee - alongside inflation - in determining when to raise interest rates. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said if productivity had taken a significant lasting hit, it meant the economy had less \"spare capacity\" to grow without generating inflationary pressures and that interest rates would need to rise at an earlier stage. Spare capacity is the Bank of England's measure of the extent to which the UK economy is underperforming, as a result of a lack of business investment either in hiring new staff, technology or machinery. It has become one of the key measures that will determine when interest rates begin to rise. Mr Archer said one argument for continued low productivity was that employment levels largely held up throughout the financial crisis, with companies often switching staff to part-time roles, implementing pay freezes or reducing hours worked per member of staff. He added: \"If much of the weakness of productivity is cyclical, then it clearly should improve markedly as the economy sees sustained decent growth. The more that productivity improves, the greater the scope of the Bank of England to keep monetary policy very accommodative. Manufacturing slowdown \"However, if productivity fails to pick up appreciably over the coming quarters, it indicates that the economy has less potential to grow without generating inflationary pressures and that interest rates will likely need to rise at a faster rate than would otherwise be the case.\" At the same time, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index indicated growth in the UK's manufacturing sector slowed to its lowest pace in more than two years in June. The closely watched index fell to 51.4 from 51.9 a month earlier. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 points to contraction. But Markit said the manufacturing sector was undoubtedly seeing a slowdown in growth, with production output expanding at its slowest pace since April 2013. \"The UK manufacturing sector had a disappointing second quarter overall,\" said Rob Dobson, economist at Markit. \"Growth trends in output and new orders were the weakest since the opening quarter of 2013, as a strong sterling exchange rate and subdued demand from mainland Europe offset the continued solidity of the domestic market.\"", "summary": "最新官方数据显示，英国经济的确在缩水，但程度不如原来预计的那么严重，而整体走势依然滞缓。"}

In a Medium post published last Thursday, Ms Krug said she had falsely assumed identities \"that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness\".

The government says it wants to \"protect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace\". China already uses facial recognition technology to survey its population. It is a world leader in such technologies, but their intensifying use across the country in recent years has sparked debate. What are the new rules? When signing up for new mobile or mobile data contracts, people are already required to show their national identification card (as required in many countries) and have their photos taken. But now, they will also have their faces scanned in order to verify that they are a genuine match for the ID provided. China has for years been trying to enforce rules to ensure that everyone using the internet does so under their \"real-name\" identities. In 2017, for example, new rules required internet platforms to verify a user's true identity before letting them post online content. The new regulation for telecom operators was framed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology as a way to \"strengthen\" this system and ensure that the government can identify all mobile phone users. Most Chinese internet users access the web via their phones. Jeffrey Ding, a researcher on Chinese artificial intelligence at Oxford University, said that one of China's motivations for getting rid of anonymous phone numbers and internet accounts was to boost cyber-security and reduce internet fraud. But another likely motivation, he said, was to better track the population: \"It's connected to a very centralised push to try to keep tabs on everyone, or that's at least the ambition.\" Are people worried? When the regulations were announced in September, the Chinese media did not make a big deal of it. But online, hundreds of social media users voiced concerns about the increasing amount of data being held on them. \"People are being more and more strictly monitored,\" one user of the Sina Weibo microblogging website said. \"What are they [the government] afraid of?\" Many others complained that China had already seen too many data breaches. \"Before, thieves knew what your name was, in the future they'll know what you'll look like,\" said one user, receiving more than 1,000 likes. Another criticised the policy, saying: \"This is being implemented without the consent of the public.\" Another said they often received scam calls from people who knew their name and address, and asked: \"Will they be able to tell what I look like now?\" But others were less cynical, saying that the move was simply in line with \"technological progress\". China already extensively censors and polices the web, removing and blocking content it does not want its citizens to see and talk about. How widespread is facial recognition in China? China is often described as a surveillance state - in 2017 it had 170 million CCTV cameras in place across the country with the goal of installing an estimated 400 million new ones by 2020. The country is also setting up a \"social credit\" system to keep score of the conduct and public interactions of all its citizens in one database. The aim is that by 2020, everyone in China will be enrolled in a vast national database that compiles fiscal and government information to give a \"ranking\" for each citizen. Facial recognition plays a key role in the surveillance system and it has been lauded as a way of catching fugitives. Last year, media noted that police were able to pick a fugitive out of a crowd of 60,000 at a concert using the technology. In the western region of Xinjiang, where up to a million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities have been detained for what the authorities call \"re-education\", surveillance cameras use facial recognition to specifically track Uighurs, based on their appearance, the New York Times reported earlier this year. But facial recognition is increasingly becoming a part of daily life and commercial transactions in China. It's used more and more, for example, to pay in shops and supermarkets. However there has been some blow-back. Earlier this year, a university professor sued a wildlife park for making facial recognition mandatory for visitors - sparking a wider debate about the state's mass collection of data on its citizens. In September, the Chinese government said it planned to \"curb and regulate\" the use of facial recognition technology in schools after reports a university was trialling using it to monitor the attendance and behaviour of students. Mr Ding said it was clear that there is increasing backlash against China's widespread adoption of facial recognition technology. Such criticism used to focus on fears of data theft, hacking and abuses by commercial companies, he said. However, increasingly, citizens seem willing to criticise how the Chinese government might exploit such data to track the population.", "summary": "中国手机用户现在在注册新的手机服务时必须进行面部扫描，以便核实中国数亿互联网用户的身份。今年九月宣布的这项规定从星期日（12月1日）开始生效。中国政府说，此举旨在“保障公民网络空间合法权益”。"}

Earlier, the Home Office said it planned to \"legislate as soon as parliamentary time allows\". Ministers say change is needed to help fight crime and terrorism, but critics warn it is an attack on privacy. Internet service providers (ISPs) are obliged to keep details of users' web access, email and internet phone calls for 12 months, under an EU directive from 2009. Although the content of the calls is not kept, the sender, recipient, time of communication and geographical location does have to be recorded. The proposed new law - which the Home Office says will be brought in \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\" - would extend those requirements to social networking sites and internet phone services such as Skype. 'Proportionate measures' It would also reportedly allow intelligence officers to access emails, calls and texts as they happen, without a warrant, rather than retrospectively - and would tighten up the rules around exactly what data ISPs must keep. Mr Clegg told the BBC people should wait to see the full proposals before judging them - and insisted the content of any communications would still only be accessible with a warrant. \"There's been a lot of scaremongering, a lot of myths about in the media over the last couple of days,\" he said. \"Any measures will be proportionate. They will not sacrifice people's civil liberties, we will not create a new government database and we will not give police new powers to look into people's emails.\" He said safeguards for privacy and civil liberties were \"absolutely guaranteed\", and added: \"Let's be clear, we aren't simply going to ram some legislation through Parliament. \"We will make sure our proposals are published in draft, people can look at them, people can debate them because there is a legitimate debate to be had here.\" A senior Home Office source said the proposal \"absolutely will not be dropped or even delayed\", but its \"passage through the Commons is still being discussed\". The source suggested it had \"not been decided\" yet whether to include it in the forthcoming Queen's Speech. BBC political correspondent John Pienaar said there did appear to have been some retreat over the timing. He said sources close to Mr Clegg believed the issue had been mishandled by the Home Office and the deputy PM had been forced to step in to sort it out. Meanwhile, 16 Lib Dem MPshave signed an open letterbacking the need for a public debate on the issue. 'Overkill' Earlier, Mrs Maytold the Sunthe move will help bring \"criminals, paedophiles and terrorists\" to justice, and \"ordinary people\" would have nothing to fear. But Chris Fox, former head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the idea was \"fraught with danger for the innocent vast majority\", not least that of misidentification, which could result from genuine criminals disguising their communications as those of law-abiding citizens. \"If you are investigating crime you have targets... it just seems to be overkill and intrusive for the 99.9% of the rest of us.\" Attempts by the last Labour government to create a giant central database containing all UK web and telephone use were dropped after huge opposition, including from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. But Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"Let's be absolutely clear, this is not what the last government proposed and we opposed.\" Peter Davies, chief executive of the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre, gave his support to the changes, saying it was right for the government to impose some \"consistency\" on the data ISPs should gather. \"At the moment, when you're investigating online activity you can get lucky, but we should take the luck out of it,\" he said. \"We are dealing with cases at the moment where we are losing the opportunity to identify paedophiles who are preying on children because it's not always possible to get the communications data we would like.\" 'Checks and balances' But, several Conservative backbenchers have attacked the proposals. Former shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"If they want to see all this information they should be willing to put their case before a judge or magistrate. This will force them to focus on the real terrorists rather than turning Britain into a nation of suspects.\" Critics have warned that any new law could end up being used more widely than originally intended - similar to the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which has been used by local authorities to check on children's school catchment areas. Labour have said the police and security services have to be able to keep up with new technology, but there must be \"clear checks and balances\" on what they are able to do. Leader Ed Miliband said the issue was \"very sensitive\" and had been \"spectacularly mishandled\" by the government, leading to fears of intrusion into people's day-to-day lives. Even if the move is announced in the Queen's Speech, any new law would still have to make it through Parliament, potentially in the face of opposition in both the Commons and the Lords. The Internet Service Providers' Association said any change in the law must be \"proportionate, respect freedom of expression and the privacy of users\".", "summary": "英国副首相克莱格（Nick Clegg）说，政府应从根本上重新考虑给予警察和情报机关更大权利，以监控电子邮件和网络的计划。"}

Both firms describe the deal as a win for their passengers, but analysts warn it could mean higher prices. Grab is South East Asia's most popular ride-sharing firm with millions of users across eight countries. Under the terms of the deal, Uber will take a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based Grab. Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will also join Grab's board. The value of the deal has not been made public. Grab's chief executive Anthony Tan said the deal \"marks the beginning of a new era\" in which the merged business would be better placed to serve customers. Uber's Mr Khosrowshahi said the deal would \"help us double down on our plans for growth as we invest heavily in our products and technology\". The deal marks Uber's third retreat after it withdrew from China in 2016 and sold its Russia business to local firm Yandex last year. Mr Khosrowshahi has been preparing the firm for an initial public offering in 2019. Uber invested $700m in its Southeast Asia business and another $2bn in China before it sold its operations there. In November, Mr Khosrowshahi, said the company's Asian operations were not going to be \"profitable any time soon\". Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Uber is keen to push the message that this isn't a retreat from South East Asia - that instead, this is a merger of equals - a partnership of sorts. But while it's true that Uber does get a sizeable stake in Grab, it is hard to ignore that this is the third market it is pulling out of. First China, then Russia - now South East Asia. Look closely at the internal email that Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi sent his staff announcing the deal, and you can see a hint of an acknowledgement that perhaps their global strategy of barging into overseas markets isn't going as well as Uber had planned. \"One of the potential dangers of our global strategy,\" he writes, \"Is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts with too many competitors.\" This deal does beg the question what does Uber do next in Asia - because it is only really Japan, South Korea and India that it now operates in - and in all of those markets, it is facing competition of some sort, home grown or otherwise. If this defeat at Grab's hands is anything to go by - Uber best be prepared for a tough battle ahead. Read more from Karishma, here: Less choice? Last year, Uber lost $4.5bn (£3.2bn) - and its chief executive - as it underwent a fundamental shake-up following a harassment scandal. But some fear that its withdrawal from South East Asia could result in higher prices for users there. \"Industry consolidation will mean fewer choices for commuters and fares are likely to trend higher over time,\" said Corrine Png, a transport analyst from Singapore-based research firm Crucial Perspective. Competition in the ride-hailing sector has been fierce, resulting in discounts and promotions offered to riders and drivers reducing profit margins. But consolidation in the industry was widely expected after Japan's Softbank Group made a large investment in Uber last year. SoftBank is a major investor in several of Uber's rivals including Grab, China's Didi Chuxing and India's Ola. It is believed to have pushed for consolidation in order to improve revenues. Grab currently operates in eight countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. The deal - which is yet to be approved by local regulators - includes the sale of all of Uber's operations in the region, including its key food delivery service Uber Eats. As a result of the merger, the GrabFood service will expand from two to four South East Asian countries by next quarter, Grab said. The company said the deal would help it move towards profitability, and would also help to increase \"adoption of the GrabPay mobile wallet and support Grab's growing Financial Services platform\".", "summary": "继中国和俄罗斯之后，优步（Uber）着手退出东南亚市场，将其东南亚业务出售给在这一地区的主要竞争对手Grab。"}

On Wednesday night, the ship sent a distress call from waters to the west of Amami Oshima island in south-western Japan. The Philippine department of foreign affairs said its consulate in the Japanese city of Osaka was \"monitoring the situation and co-ordinating\" with authorities. The Japanese coastguard \"is launching a second search-and-rescue mission prior to the expected incoming typhoon\", it said in a press release. Liezel Pitogo, 38, last spoke to her husband Lindon, a seafarer on the ship, on Tuesday evening. He said they were travelling to China but were a bit worried about the weather, she told the BBC, speaking from Quezon province in the Philippines. \"His phone was unreachable on Wednesday,\" Ms Pitogo said. \"I thought it's just a problem with the erratic signal when they are on the sea but I saw a Facebook post from a seaman's wife about a cargo ship that went missing so I started contacting and asking some of the other wives.\" Both Australia and New Zealand said they were providing consular assistance to the families of their crew members. The Gulf Livestock 1 is a 139m (450ft), Panamanian-flagged cargo vessel built in 2002. Strong winds and torrential rains from the typhoon battering the region are hampering the search effort. How powerful is the typhoon? After moving through the East China Sea, Typhoon Maysak, named after a Cambodian tree, made landfall early on Thursday in the South Korean port city of Busan, packing winds of 140km/h (87mph). At least two people are reported to have been killed in the city. One was a woman whose apartment window was shattered by the force of the wind. Another man in Busan was believed to have fallen to his death from the roof of his house. Yonhap news agency reported he had been repairing a leak. More than 2,200 people have been evacuated to shelters and about 120,000 homes were left without power in the affected region. Wind and rain have flooded Busan's streets. Flights have been cancelled and ferries suspended. Maysak is one of the strongest storms to hit the region in years. It is moving north and made a second landfall at Kimchaek in North Korea, before weakening as it tracked into north-east China. North Korean TV showed flooded farmland. The storm comes after the Korean peninsula suffered a summer of monsoons and widespread flooding. Another typhoon - Haishen - is forming south of Japan and is due to hit the Korean coast on Monday.", "summary": "日本海岸警卫队营救出一名在台风中失踪货船上的船员。货船失踪时船上有43名船员，并载有6000头牛。"}

A German intelligence official was arrested last week on suspicion of spying. An inquiry has also begun into a German defence ministry worker, reports said. \"The representative of the US intelligence services at the embassy of the United States of America has been told to leave Germany,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Analysis by Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Earlier this week the White House described the partnership between the US and Germany as one built on respect. But no-one likes to be spied on, especially when it's your friend doing the spying. This latest episode is yet another reminder of how American surveillance programmes are causing friction with allies. It's angered many in Germany, where the issue of snooping is historically a very sensitive one, and many are asking: \"What? Again?\" It wasn't too long ago, after all, that we heard the National Security Agency was spying on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone. After a review into the surveillance programmes, President Obama promised the US wouldn't spy on its friends overseas. But despite requests to be included, Germany isn't part of a non-spying pact the US has with Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The White House will want to do all it can to repair any trust issues over this latest incident, so they can work together in other areas - for example, it needs German support for tougher sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. Analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Berlin The request by the German government follows increasing frustration that it has failed to get US assurances that spying would cease on German citizens from Chancellor Merkel down. She was shocked to learn that her mobile phone conversations were secretly being monitored while President Obama was greeting her as a friend on his visit to Berlin. Chancellor Merkel has tried to maintain a balance between condemning America's actions but also maintaining cordial relations. Each revelation has made that balance harder to achieve. This matters because America needs German help on a range of issues from trying to get the world economy out of its difficulties, to finding united Western action on Russia, to dealing with the revelations emanating from Edward Snowden who is currently in Moscow but whom some German lawmakers want to invite to Berlin. The chairman of the Bundestag (parliament) committee overseeing the secret service said the action had been taken because of America's spying on German politicians and its failure to co-operate and provide adequate responses. The US has not denied allegations that a German intelligence agency employee arrested last week was passing secret documents to the US National Security Agency (NSA). However, the latest reports that an employee within the defence ministry was also spying for the US were considered more serious. Although no arrest was made, searches were carried out on Wednesday at the ministry and elsewhere. The US and Germany have been close allies for decades but relations were hit last year when it emerged that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been monitored by the NSA. The White House declined to comment on the matter but said the security and intelligence relationship with Germany \"is a very important one and keeps Germans and Americans safe\". \"It is essential that co-operation continue in all areas and we will continue to be in touch with the German government in appropriate channels,\" spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Timeline: Germany spy scandal October 2013: German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls US President Barack Obama after revelations that the US may have spied on her mobile phone June 2014: Germany announces an investigation into the claims 4 July 2014: A suspected US spy said to be working for the German intelligence agency is arrested 9 July 2014: A second case emerges as searches are carried out at the defence ministry 10 July 2014: German government orders expulsion of CIA official On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said spying on allies was a \"waste of energy\". \"We have so many problems, we should focus on the important things,\" she said. \"In the Cold War maybe there was general mistrust. Today we are living in the 21st Century. Today there are completely new threats.\" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the information that the US appeared to have gained from the suspected espionage was \"laughable\" but the political damage was \"disproportionate and serious\". The scale of the US agency's surveillance was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the US and is now a fugitive in Russia. The German intelligence official arrested last week was alleged to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. When Mrs Merkel visited the White House in May, President Barack Obama sought to assure her and the German people they were not subject to \"continual surveillance\" by the US. He said \"complicated issues\" were involved but he anticipated that the matter would be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries.", "summary": "在接连两起疑似美国间谍案曝光后，德国政府要求一名驻柏林的美国中央情报局官员离境。"}

The figures, from Office for National Statistics, also suggest about a fifth of new graduates were unemployed. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber called for an industrial strategy to reverse the trend of graduates taking low-skilled jobs. Mr Barber said a lack of quality jobs had forced people with degrees into lower-skilled jobs. He said the government should focus on boosting high value industries such as manufacturing. \"Otherwise public investment in education and the talents of graduates will continue to be wasted,\" he added. Best paid The study also calculates the typical wage of graduates aged between 21 and 64 to be just over £15 an hour - easily outstripping the average earnings of just under £9 an hour for non-graduates. The figures suggest that the best-paid graduates of all ages are those with degrees in medicine and dentistry, earning an average of more than £21 an hour. The lowest-paid graduates are those with degrees in the arts and humanities, who earn on average around £12 an hour. The figures indicate that graduates are less likely to be unemployed than the rest of the available workforce. At the end of 2011, the proportion of graduates of all ages who were in work stood at 86%, compared with 72.3% for non-graduates. But the report says that since the recession began in 2008, the employment prospects of recent graduates have become more limited. Twice as many new graduates were out of work at the end of last year as in 2008. But the figures suggest that the employment prospects of new graduates may be improving slowly. At the end of last year 18.9% of new graduates were out of work, compared with 20.5% at the peak of the recent recession. The figures are also better than in the recession in the 1990s, when unemployment for new graduates peaked at 26.9% in 1993. Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: \"A degree remains a good investment in the long term and is one of the best pathways to a good job and a rewarding career. \"Graduates, like everybody else, are facing tough times but the evidence shows they fare better than non-graduates and their prospects tend to pick up quicker during the recovery.\" Carl Gilleard of the Association of Graduate Recruiters advised graduates to see any experience in the workplace as a valuable stepping stone towards their longer-term career goals. Libby Hackett, director of University Alliance, called for universities to make the case for more higher education places as, despite the recession, the number of graduate vacancies continues to grow as a proportion of the total workforce.", "summary": "英国国家统计局（Office of National Statistics）发布的新数据显示，和10年前相比，大学毕业生做低技能工作的可能性大为增加。"}

Downing Street said it was \"working with Chinese authorities so the flight can take off as soon as possible\". The virus has caused at least 170 deaths, spreading to every Chinese region and at least 15 other countries. The flight from Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, had been expected to arrive on Thursday morning. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said when the passengers do return, they are due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and be transported to former NHS staff accommodation in the north west of England. They will be put in \"supported isolation\" for 14 days with \"all necessary medical attention\", a Downing Street spokesman said. A small team of military medics is flying out to Wuhan to accompany passengers on the repatriation flight, the Ministry of Defence said. In a separate development, British Airways said it had extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February, following Foreign Office guidance against \"all but essential travel\" to the country. Britons waiting for the UK government's repatriation flight said they had been told it had been put back \"provisionally\" to Friday. Several UK citizens said they faced a stark choice as family members with Chinese citizenship were not being permitted to travel by local authorities. Matt Raw lives in Wuhan with his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his wife, who helps care for her. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that his wife had been prevented from flying so the whole family was staying. He said they were also concerned about the risks of flying, having seen reports that three Japanese people on evacuation flights were found to have the virus. Adam Bridgeman said he would stay in Wuhan if his wife and one-month-old son were not allowed to fly with him. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that remaining in Wuhan with a newborn was \"a tough situation\" as they were \"not willing to take the risk\" of bringing him to hospital for routine treatment such as vaccinations. Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a \"terrible dilemma\" after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back - but not his Chinese wife, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK. As it stands, Mr Siddle's wife is not travelling back to the UK with him. \"I think there's still negotiations to get that changed, but the official line is still that she can't fly,\" he said. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country as of Wednesday night. The Foreign Office said a number of other countries' flights had also been unable to take off as planned. 'Stress of being locked up' Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Roughly 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - have also left Wuhan on an evacuation flight. However, a number of UK citizens in China said local authorities had prevented members of their families from leaving because they held Chinese passports. Another UK citizen due to be flown out of Wuhan said she was told to leave behind her three-year-old son because he has a Chinese passport. Natalie Francis, originally from York, said: \"I literally had no words when I got the call.\" The Foreign Office said its priority was to keep British nationals and their families together. The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide later whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency. How deadly is coronavirus? It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 170 deaths and the 7,711 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people. Professor Sian Griffiths said the \"shared response across the world\" to the new coronavirus was more effective than during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which she examined in an official inquiry. She told BBC Breakfast that world governments were \"taking everything very seriously in an attempt to contain the virus\", deploying greater resources and offering clear public health messages.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire called the rise \"deeply disappointing\". Figures also show 8.3m people were born abroad - 13% of the UK population - the first time the number has passed 8m. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the \"figures reflect 'Borderless Britain' and total impotence of the British government\" and called on the prime minister to negotiate controls on migration from EU countries. Reaction: UK migration reaches record high UK migration figures 330,000 Net migration to UK, in year ending March 2015 28% Increase since March 2014 10,000 higher than previous peak in 2005 61% of EU immigrants who wanted work had definite jobs to go to 9,000 fewer people have emigrated since 2014 It is the fifth consecutive quarterly rise in the net migration figure - with increases in arrivals from both inside and outside the EU. Net migration of EU citizens was 183,000, up 53,000 from the year ending March 2014. The number of those arriving from countries outside the EU was still larger, with net migration measured at 196,000, up 39,000 on a year earlier. Expansion of the EU and the relatively fast recovery of Britain's economy are seen as key factors in the trend. About two-thirds of the EU migrants were said to be workers, and a fifth students. Among the migrants from outside the EU, about a half were students, a quarter workers, and one sixth family members. Among the other ONS findings based on the latest figures were: In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that he was giving a \"no ifs, no buts\" promise that he would bring immigration numbers down to \"levels our country can manage\". During the election campaign he reiterated this promise and said he would not \"cave in\" and abandon the target. BBC's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there were \"lots of figures, but no cheer for a prime minister who promised he would reduce immigration to levels the country could manage\". \"His ambition on migration is fast turning into a political embarrassment,\" he added. After the latest set of figures, the government insisted it was acting to control immigration but said the EU needed to do more to help ease the current migrant crisis across Europe. Mr Brokenshire said that the \"reliance that business continues to place on migrant labour\" and students staying in the UK after they had finished their studies, were two potential reasons for the rise. \"Current flows of people across Europe are on a scale we haven't seen since the end of World War Two. This is not sustainable and risks the future economic development of other EU member states,\" he added. 'Morally wrong' Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, said David Cameron \"needs to stop the dishonesty over his failed immigration target\". She said: \"All his overblown rhetoric has achieved is a decline in public confidence as the electorate are faced with more broken promises. \"But most troubling of all, the net migration target treats immigration and asylum as the same. That is morally wrong and is preventing Britain playing its part in responding to the terrible refugee crisis that stems from Syria and has spread across Europe. The Institute of Directors and think tank British Future said Mr Cameron was \"punishing businesses\" by trying to fulfil promises to cut immigration. Meanwhile, Jamil Dhanji an immigration barrister told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme migrants were not coming to the UK to claim benefits. \"Migrants I see are not coming to this country for that reason,\" he said. Earlier this week the government announced more details of its new Immigration Bill, which is due to be introduced in the autumn. Under the legislation, illegal immigrants caught working in the UK could face up to six months in prison and late-night takeaways and off-licences will face closure if they are found employing foreigners who have no legal right to be in the country.", "summary": "英国国家统计局的数字显示，截至到三月，英国净移民数为327000人，仍接近336000人的历史最高纪录。"}

The mayor called this short-sighted, but said plans to expand either Gatwick or Heathrow airports would fail. These plans face huge opposition and no government would back them, he claimed. The proposal for a Thames Estuary airport - dubbed Boris Island because of the mayor's strong backing - would have led to the development of a four-runway airport on the Isle of Grain. 'Serious doubts' But Sir Howard said in the commission's report: \"We are not persuaded that a very large airport in the Thames estuary is the right answer to London's and the UK's connectivity needs. \"While we recognise the need for a hub airport, we believe this should be a part of an effective system of competing airports to meet the needs of a widely spread and diverse market like London's. \"There are serious doubts about the delivery and operation of a very large hub airport in the estuary. \"The economic disruption would be huge and there are environmental hurdles which it may prove impossible, or very time-consuming to surmount,\" Sir Howard said. The least ambitious version of the island scheme would cost £70bn to £90bn, much more than other options, he said. \"The need for additional capacity is urgent. We need to focus on solutions which are deliverable, affordable, and set the right balance for the future,\" Sir Howard added. The decision not to shortlist the Isle of Grain as an option leaves the commission with three choices: adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow, and a new runway at Gatwick. 'Gathering dust' Sir Howard's commission was set up by the government to consider ways of expanding airport capacity. The final report is expected next summer, after the general election. Mr Johnson said: \"In one myopic stroke, the Airports Commission has set the debate back by half a century and consigned their work to the long list of vertically filed reports on aviation expansion that are gathering dust on a shelf in Whitehall. \"Gatwick is not a long-term solution and [Sir] Howard Davies must explain to the people of London how he can possibly envisage that an expansion of Heathrow, which would create unbelievable levels of noise, blight and pollution, is a better idea than a new airport to the east of London that he himself admits is visionary, and which would create the jobs and growth this country needs to remain competitive.\" However, Mr Johnson said that the island airport plans were not finished, despite the commission's announcement. Proposals to expand either Heathrow and Gatwick would run into hurdles - as they had done in the past - and any future government would return to the Thames estuary plan. That would make any future recommendation made by the Airports Commission \"irrelevant\", he said. But Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said the commission's decision was the right one. 'Reducing noise' \"This is an important juncture in the aviation debate because now Britain's choice is clear; expand Gatwick and support genuine competition, lower fares and greater choice for passengers or expand Heathrow and return to the stale monopoly of the past and watch the cost of going on holiday, travelling for business and exporting goods and service go up,\" Mr Wingate said. He said Gatwick's case for another runway offered the cheapest, quickest and most low risk solution to the urgent need to expand airport capacity. However, Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said his airport was now in pole position for expansion. \"We have always agreed with the mayor that Britain needs a successful hub airport to compete in the global race for jobs and growth. Heathrow is now the only hub left in the race,\" he said. \"We would like to work with the mayor to deliver Heathrow expansion in a way that benefits the whole country while reducing noise impacts for local people compared to today.\" British Airways, the biggest operator at Heathrow, said: \"We've always said that there was no economic case for a Thames estuary airport so it's no surprise that the Davies Commission, after a thorough investigation, has ruled it out.\"", "summary": "英国机场委员会否决了在泰晤士河河口修建新机场的建议，但伦敦市长约翰逊（Boris Johnson）表示他对计划仍有信心。"}

The study, conducted on almost 2,000 people, showed an average 15kg weight loss during the 15-month trial. Scientists said the results could mark a \"new era\" in treating obesity with even more therapies on the horizon. Jan, from Kent, lost 28kg (four stone), equivalent to more than a fifth of her body weight. \"The drug changed my life and completely altered my approach to food,\" she said. She said dieting had made her \"miserable\" but taking the drug was completely different as she was less hungry. 'Effortless' However, now Jan has come off the trial her appetite has returned and she is putting weight back on. She said: \"It felt effortless losing weight while on the trial, but now it has gone back to feeling like a constant battle with food.\" Semaglutide will already be familiar to some people who use it as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, but this trial looked at giving it at higher doses. The drug works by hijacking the body's appetite levels and mimicking a hormone - called GLP1 - that is released after eating a filling meal. The trial gave some people the drug and others a dummy injection, while both groups were given the lifestyle advice. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed people lost an average of 15kg on semaglutide compared with 2.6kg without. However, 32% of people lost a fifth of their body weight with the drug, compared with fewer than 2% on the dummy treatment. 'New era' Prof Rachel Batterham, from UCL and one of the UK researchers, told the BBC News website: \"This is a game-changer in the amount of weight loss it causes. \"I have spent the last 20 years doing obesity research, up until now we've not had an effective treatment for obesity apart from bariatric surgery.\" She said losing weight would reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and of severe Covid-19. Semaglutide is being submitted to drugs regulators so cannot be routinely prescribed. However, Prof Batterham expects the drug would be used initially by specialist weight loss clinics rather than being widely available. There were side-effects to the treatment including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation. And there are five-year studies taking place to see if weight loss can be sustained in the long term. Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"The amount of weight loss achieved is greater than that seen with any licensed anti-obesity drug. \"This is the start of a new era for obesity drug development with the future direction being to achieve levels of weight loss comparable to semaglutide, while having fewer side-effects.\" Dr Duane Mellor, a dietitian and from Aston Medical School, said: \"It is useful to have a potential option to help people lose weight, however we need to acknowledge that weight loss will still need lifestyle change, and that any medication or change in lifestyle can bring potential risks and side-effects. \"So, it is always wise to speak to a health professional before trying to lose weight.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "一种能抑制人体食欲的减肥新药效果显著，有些人在用药后成功把体重减轻了五分之一。"}

Now 22, the youngest US recipient of a face transplant has shared the results of several years of exhaustive reconstructive surgery with National Geographic magazine. The publication was given unprecedented access by an Ohio clinic which operated on Katie when she was just 21. A journalist and photographers followed her preparation and the results from the invasive 31-hour procedure. The Story of a Face is on the cover of the magazine's September issue, and Katie's story is also told in a documentary online. There have only been 40 recipients of a face transplant throughout the world. The first full-face procedure was successfully carried out by Spanish doctors in 2010. But because surgery is still considered experimental, it is not covered by US insurance providers. Katie's surgery was eventually funded by the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, which wants to improve treatment of military personnel who are injured at war. Katie, now 22, was deemed a good candidate because of her age and the nature of the injuries she had sustained. The transplanted face came from 31-year-old Adrea Schneider, who died from a drug overdose in 2017. She was already an organ donor, but the decision to donate her face came from her grandmother, Sandra Bennington, who has since met Katie following the surgery. Katie says she cannot remember much about the period before her suicide attempt, but family say she had been struggling emotionally with moving around, a failed relationship and chronic gastrointestinal health problems throughout her teens. The bullet wound destroyed much of her face - including her nose, some of her forehead and jawbone. She also had brain injuries and significant damage to her eyes. After being initially treated in Mississippi, she was transferred to Tennessee before ending up at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - a facility already performing pioneering transplant procedures. Before the transplant, Katie had already undergone 22 reconstructive surgeries, including using her thigh and 3D printing to help reconstruct her jaw. She and her family say they did not even know what the procedure entailed when they were notified she could be eligible. \"I had no clue what a face transplant was,\" Katie said. \"When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again.\" After a year on the transplant list and having two donors fall through, she eventually underwent the procedure in May 2017. Initially it was supposed to be a more partial procedure, but the decision was taken to use more of the donor's face to improve the match. Since the operation, she has had three revision surgeries. More operations are likely in order to improve appearance and functionality of the face. Katie still has difficulty speaking because of the damage done to her mouth. She will have to take medication for the rest of her life to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. 'Second chance' The young woman told National Geographic she hopes to go to college and eventually go into counselling. She has also expressed an interest in speaking to teenagers about suicide and the value of life. \"So many people have helped me; now I want to help other people,\" she said. Dr Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, said Katie had received the \"ultimate second chance\" through the procedure, CNN reports. \"My first wish for Katie is to be happy,\" Mr Gastman said. \"That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy. \"Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects - for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are.\" If you need help over issues raised in this story:", "summary": "凯蒂·斯塔布菲尔德（Katie Stubblefield）18岁的时候试图自杀，她朝自己的头部开枪。"}

The warning comes as a BBC survey suggests nearly 50% of men between 18-30 \"might consider\" having a procedure. The government is about to launch a campaign in England to tackle cosmetic treatments that go wrong. The survey, commissioned by Radio 1 Newsbeat and the Victoria Derbyshire programme, found that of those who'd had a cosmetic procedure in the past, abdominal implants and Botox were among the most common. Save Face says they get more men visiting their site than women now and the number of complaints from them has risen dramatically. \"There is a definite trend of men seeking these procedures and in turn men who are suffering complications when procedures go wrong,\" says Ashton Collins from the group. She says images on social media and programmes like Love Island and Geordie Shore are partly responsible for men wanting to change their bodies. And it seems the perfect torso is what a lot of men under 30 are aiming for. As part of this BBC survey of around 2,000 men and women, respondents were asked what part of them they would most like to change - the most popular choices among men were their stomach and chest, with 34% selecting them. Worried about his chest, Mike decided to have surgery to reduce what he calls his \"man boobs.\" \"You'd be out at the gym and you'd be conscious of it.

Other mobile networks will not be able to offer 4G until next year. Critics have questioned the service's affordability - particularly with regard to data usage allowance. Belfast, Derby, Hull, Newcastle and Nottingham will be active by Christmas, the company said. Network EE, formerly known as Everything, Everywhere and which owns Orange and T-Mobile in the UK, has promised speeds of between 8 to 12Mbps - up to five times faster than third generation mobile technology, known as 3G. The extra speed and capacity allows for high-quality streaming of audio, video and other content while on the move. The company said as well as giving customers faster internet, 4G would also be of big benefit to businesses. All-you-can-eat world However, such benefits come at a cost - the entry tariff of £36 per month includes 500MB of data, beyond which an add-on cost must be paid if the user wishes to carry on using the internet on their mobile. An hour of streaming a programme using, for example, the BBC iPlayer mobile app, can use up to 225MB - almost half the entry level tariff's data allowance limit. The add-on costs for extra data begins at £3 for 50MB, and extends to £20 for 4GB. The company's top tariff for standard customers will cost £56 per month, and has a data allowance of 8GB. EE boss Olaf Swantee has said that the pricing is based on \"months of consumer research\" and that the tariffs have been priced at \"the sweet spot\". But Matthew Howett, a regulation analyst at Ovum, said EE has a challenge in convincing consumers their 4G is good value for money. \"It's fair to say that EE has attracted a fair degree of criticism not so much for the price of the 4G tariffs, but rather on the amount of data bundled at each level,\" he said. \"EE was always going to have a difficult role to play being the first mover. \"However, its peers may be grateful for attempting to move away from an all-you-can-eat world for data to an attempt to monetise it. \"Too quickly data became commoditised for operators once smartphones and other connected devices proliferated.\" User poaching A successful 4G launch is seen as critical for EE if it is to poach customers from other networks. EE was granted its headstart in the 4G market last month when it was given permission to run the next-generation service using its existing bandwidth. Its competitors are unable to offer 4G until the conclusion of a spectrum auction scheduled for early next year. The auction will determine how newly available signal spectrum will be offered to the other networks. The process had been continually delayed by a combination of factors, from a change of government to threats of legal action from operators. On 2 October, O2 and Vodafone agreed not to take legal action against EE, and instead settled for assurances that the process of launching their own 4G services would be sped up. But since EE's 4G announcement, rival networks have sought to undermine the firm's offering. In a statement on its website, Vodafone underlined what it saw as a weakness in EE's 4G - indoor coverage. \"Indoor coverage matters,\" the company wrote. \"That's why we've made a commitment to provide 98% indoor coverage. \"The reason we can do this is because we intend to use 800MHz frequency. Without getting too technical, this means your signal travels further into your home than any 4G signal that's available now, all things being equal.\"", "summary": "作为英国首家提供移动4G服务的移动运营商EE，将率先在英国11座城市启动这项服务。"}

There is no standard measure of inequality, but most indicators suggest it slowed or fell during the financial crisis and is now growing again. The OECD warns that such inequality is a threat to economic growth. The report says this is partly because there is a wider gap in education in the most unequal countries, which leads to a less effective workforce. OECD member states include most of the European Union as well as developed economies such as the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. One of the factors that the OECD blames for growing inequality is the growth in what it calls non-standard work, which includes temporary contracts and self-employment. The OECD says that since the mid-1990s more than half of all job creation in its member states has been in non-standard work. It says that households dependent on such work have higher poverty rates than other households and that this has led to greater inequality. It also says that tax and benefit systems have become less effective at redistributing income. On the other hand it says that one of the factors limiting the growth in inequality has been the increasing number of women working. The report says that one of the few areas where inequality has not been growing in the last 30 years has been Latin America, although levels of inequality were much higher there to start with. Analysis: Robert Peston, economics editor The main theory the OECD puts forward for why inequality and growth are negatively correlated is that poorer people invest less in their own education and self improvement - which is why its main anti-inequality prescriptions are government investment in skills and education, and a focus on a promoting better quality jobs. Strikingly it isn't saying that the best way to greater equality and faster growth is to soak the rich. Instead it wants activism focused on raising the living standards of the poorest, especially the poorest 40%. It calculates, therefore, that if living standards in the UK for poorer people were raised to the relative levels of France - that if so-called \"bottom inequality\" was reduced by half of a standard deviation (to use the jargon) - annual growth in national income or GDP would rise by 0.3% every year for 25 years. That's not to be sniffed at. It would represent increasing our current growth rate by around 13%. Read more from Robert One of the best-known commentators on inequality is Prof Joe Stiglitz from Columbia Business School. He told BBC News that the problem was not just with lack of training and education. \"What we've seen, particularly in the last 15 years, is that even those who are college graduates have seen their incomes stagnate. The real problem is the rules of the game are stacked for the monopolists, the CEOs [chief executives] of corporations.\" \"CEOs today get pay that's roughly 300 times that of ordinary workers - it used to be 20 or 30 times. No increase in productivity justifies this change in relative compensation.\" Behind the OECD averages there is a considerable range in the degrees of inequality in each country. Household wealth The Gini coefficient is a figure showing how well income is distributed across a country. A coefficient of zero would mean everybody was paid the same amount, while one would mean all the money was earned by one person. The average across the OECD was 0.32. Chile had the highest at 0.50, indicating that income distribution there was the most unequal, while Denmark was the lowest at 0.25, making it the most equal. The UK and US were both near the top of the rankings with coefficients of 0.35 and 0.40 respectively. One of the report's authors, Mark Pearson from the OECD, told BBC News: \"It's not just income that we're seeing being very concentrated - you look at wealth and you find that the bottom 40% of the population in rich countries have only 3% of household wealth whereas the top 10% have over half of household wealth.\" \"So that combination of both wealth and income being very concentrated, it means there is no equality of opportunity in many societies and that undermines our growth.\"", "summary": "经济合作与发展组织（OECD）发布报告表示，在该组织各成员国社会中贫富差距不断扩大。"}

The case could ratchet up tensions between China and the US, and impact the firm's global expansion efforts. Both Ms Meng and Huawei deny the allegations. Ms Meng was arrested in Canada last month at the request of the US for allegedly evading sanctions on Iran. \"For years, Chinese firms have broken our export laws and undermined sanctions, often using US financial systems to facilitate their illegal activities. This will end,\" said US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. In a statement, Huawei rejected the charges, saying it didn't commit \"any of the asserted violations\" and that it \"is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng\". It said the allegations were already the subject of a settled civil suit, in which a jury found \"neither damages nor willful and malicious conduct on the trade secret claim\". What are the charges? The indictment alleges Huawei misled the US and a global bank about its relationship with two subsidiaries, Huawei Device USA and Skycom Tech, to conduct business with Iran. US President Donald Trump's administration has reinstated all sanctions on Iran removed under a 2015 nuclear deal and recently imposed even stricter measures, hitting oil exports, shipping and banks. A second case alleges Huawei stole technology from T Mobile used to test smartphone durability, as well as obstructing justice and committing wire fraud. The T-Mobile tech, known as Tappy, mimicked human fingers to test phones. In all, the US has laid 23 charges against the company. \"These charges lay bare Huawei's alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Mr Wray said companies like Huawei \"pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security\". What's the context? Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second biggest smartphone maker by volume after Samsung. But the US and other Western nations have been concerned that the Chinese government could use Huawei's technology to expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. The arrest of Ms Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, infuriated China. She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Chinese 'national champion' faces US justice Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Huawei is what the Chinese call a national champion. A private firm, tasked with China's ambitions to go into the world and lead the way. But now the full force of the US justice system is being hurled at the firm. The allegations by the US Department of Justice are the most serious Huawei has ever seen, and go to the heart of the trade war between China and the US. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations, and the firm's boss says it is being used as a pawn in power games between the US and China. While the US says the charges against Huawei aren't about trade war, it is unlikely the Chinese will see it the same way. The charges come as the US and China prepare to hold high-level trade talks in Washington this week. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated that the Huawei charges were \"wholly separate\" from ongoing trade negotiations with China. However, the indictment focuses on the alleged theft of US technology, which has been a major sticking point in trade negotiations. President Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on $250bn (£190bn) worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond with its own tariffs.

The policy was revealed as part of a legal battle with campaign group Privacy International (PI). PI labelled the policy \"patronising\". It is the first time the UK has commented on how its legal framework allows the mass interception of communications, as outlined by US whistleblower Edward Snowden in his leaks about global government surveillance. The former National Security Agency contractor revealed extensive details of internet and phone snooping and has since fled the US and sought temporary asylum in Russia. Charles Farr, director general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, told PI that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and web searches on Google - as well as webmail services such as Hotmail and Yahoo - were classified as \"external communications\", which meant they could be intercepted without the need for additional legal clearance. Internal communications between citizens can only be intercepted when a targeted warrant is issued. Warrants must be signed by a minister and can only be issued when there is suspicion of illegal activity. But when someone searches for something on Google or posts on Facebook they are sending information overseas - constituting an act of external communication that could be collected under a broader warrant which does not need to be signed by a minister, explained Mr Farr in a 48-page written statement. However, he said data collected in this way \"cannot be read, looked at or listened to\" except in strictly limited circumstances. Mr Farr said there was a \"significant distinction\" between intercepting material and a person actually reading, looking at or listening it. Although this is the first time Mr Farr has publicly commented on the matter, the issue was previously raised by privacy researcher Caspar Bowden. He briefed the House of Lords in 2000 ahead of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act coming into effect, which granted GCHQ the relevant power. However, he told the BBC that his testimony was only presented to a near-empty House of Lords and was not reported outside of Hansard. Analysis - Gordon Corera, security correspondent British intelligence has always said that its activities are lawful. But one of the problems has been that the law surrounding interception is incredibly hard to understand. Charles Farr's statement provides new details of how the government believes it applies to different forms of communications. It reveals that a Google search by someone in Britain may be considered an external communication because the request and the result go abroad to Google's computers. That means it could be swept up under the broader warrant covering \"external \"communications. However, Mr Farr says that actually reading or examining a Briton's communications swept up in this way would still require a domestic, more targeted warrant. Much of the debate over whether the state does conduct mass surveillance comes down to a central question - does the act of computers collecting information constitute surveillance or does it take a person reading or accessing that data for someone's privacy to be invaded? Speak to privacy advocates and government officials and you get a radically different answer. Mr Farr did not reveal the extent to which GCHQ used its power to intercept external communications. In a statement, GCHQ said all its work was \"carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate\". 'Byzantine' laws But civil liberty groups were outraged by the revelations. James Welch, legal director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"The security services consider that they're entitled to read, listen and analyse all our communications on Facebook, Google and other US-based platforms. \"If there was any remaining doubt that our snooping laws need a radical overhaul there can be no longer.\" Meanwhile, Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said the revelation showed that spy agencies operated under their own laws. \"Intelligence agencies cannot be considered accountable to Parliament and to the public they serve when their actions are obfuscated through secret interpretations of Byzantine laws.\" But some others did not find the revelations surprising. Alan Woodward, a security expert who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ, said: \"I think what is happening is that people are just becoming familiar with legislation that has been in place for many years, probably because of all the civil liberty groups raising concerns. As you can see from the Act, it has never been a secret. \"The bit that people tend to forget is that RIPA [Regulation of Investigatory Powers] has protections as well, something you won't find in many other countries. The difference in the UK is that civil liberty organisations have the right to challenge these things, a right which they would not have in, say, Russia.\" However, Mr Bowden suggested the relevant statute had been obscurely worded. \"Interpreting that section requires the unravelling of a triple-nested inversion of meanings across six cross-referenced subsections, linked to a dozen other cross-linked definitions, which are all dependent on a highly ambiguous 'notwithstanding',\" he said. The legal challenge, brought by PI, Amnesty, the American Civil Liberties Union and six other national civil liberties organisations, was a direct response to the revelations made by Mr Snowden about the UK's global digital surveillance.", "summary": "英国政府透露，情报机构政府通讯总部（GCHQ）可以无需授权监视英国公民在社交媒体脸书（Facebook）和谷歌（Google）等服务系统上的使用情况，因为这些公司都设在海外。"}

One retired school teacher from Tianjin hit the headlines when she purchased dozens of dogs to save them. Residents and vendors in Yulin say the animals are killed in a humane way. Activists say the killing is cruel and an online campaign to ban the festival has been signed by more than 3.8 million people so far and the campaign has attracted considerable support this year from celebrities both domestic and foreign. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have spoken out on Twitter with the hashtag #StopYuLin2015. Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actor Yang Mi have said they are joining the campaign on micro blogging site Weibo. Why UK doesn't eat dog meat And Chinese actor Fan Bingbing and others posted a video online against the festival. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, this festival began in recent years, Xinhua said. City officials have distanced themselves from the gathering. \"Some residents of Yulin have the habit of coming together to eat lychees and dog meat during the summer solstice,\" the city's news office wrote on Weibo. \"The 'summer solstice lychee and dog meat festival' is a commercial term, the city has never [officially] organised a 'dog meat festival',\" it added. As in recent years, some animal lovers resorted to buying some of the dogs in order to rescue them. Yang Xiaoyun, retired school teacher, paid about 7,000 yuan ($1,100; £710) to save 100 dogs on Saturday. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says this kind of dispute puts the government in a really difficult position. The glorified consumption of dog meat generates a lot of negative foreign media reports, embarrassing the authorities. Also, the dog meat industry has been accused of many underhand tactics, including the illegal capture of family pets to use as food. But at the same time, the government is wary of the increasingly sophisticated animal rights movement, she adds. Animal rights activists in China have formed a cohesive network on social media that extends to many foreign animal welfare groups. China's leaders do not want to encourage such a movement amid a wider crackdown on civil disturbance of any kind.", "summary": "中国西南广西省的年度玉林“狗肉节”如期进行，再度引发保护动物活动人士的强烈反对之声。"}

The move is in part a result of pressure from Washington. However, the precise time frame and details of the phase-out will be crucial in determining how the decision is received. In January, after a lengthy delays and hard-fought battles, the government announced that Huawei would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network and limited to 35% market share of its other parts. But now it finds itself revisiting that decision. A key reason is the Trump administration has continued what one UK official calls a campaign of \"unrelenting pressure\" on the company. US officials have claimed China could use the firm as a gateway to \"spy, steal or attack\" the UK - Huawei denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. New sanctions in May limited Huawei's access to US chip technology. That forced the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review to understand whether using alternative chips would reduce the level of assurance it could offer about Huawei's presence in the UK. But the decision will be as much about geopolitics and domestic politics as it is about technicalities. Attitudes to China have hardened in the last six months. The Coronavirus crisis - and Beijing's handling of it - have increased concerns about dependencies on China. And the growing tension over Hong Kong has heightened concerns about whether China is becoming more authoritarian. A significant Conservative backbench rebellion in March suggested there were already many wanting a tougher policy, and their confidence and numbers have been fuelled by events in the intervening months. But amid heavy lobbying from telecoms companies, which have warned of mobile coverage blackouts if they are forced to remove Huawei equipment fast, the government has been debating how quickly to move. A long lead time for Huawei kit to be removed of seven to 10 years would leave critics unhappy but cause less disruption. Three to five years would placate them, but impose many more costs because of the need to rip out existing Huawei equipment, which is sometimes integrated with 4G and older equipment. If the telecom networks fall behind with their 5G rollout as a result, it would make it harder for the government to deliver on its promises of increasing connectivity for the country in the coming years. China may also seek some way of punishing the UK, partly to discourage others from following its course. But equally, if the new policy is seen as not tough enough, then critics on the backbenches may continue their rebellion to push for a tighter time-frame when legislation is brought to parliament in the autumn. Whatever the case, a decision which has already been overturned once may still be fought over in the months ahead.", "summary": "英国政府很有可能会改变初衷，收紧华为5G在英国的使用。近期媒体的多番报道透露政策走向。"}

Researchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today. Historically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour. Researchers in Austria say the trend is likely to continue, but not to the extent that non-surgical births will become obsolete. Dr Philipp Mitteroecker, of the department of theoretical biology at the University of Vienna, said there was a long standing question in the understanding of human evolution. \"Why is the rate of birth problems, in particular what we call fetopelvic disproportion - basically that the baby doesn't fit through the maternal birth canal - why is this rate so high?\" he said. \"Without modern medical intervention such problems often were lethal and this is, from an evolutionary perspective, selection. \"Women with a very narrow pelvis would not have survived birth 100 years ago. They do now and pass on their genes encoding for a narrow pelvis to their daughters.\" Opposing forces It has been a long standing evolutionary question why the human pelvis has not grown wider over the years. The head of a human baby is large compared with other primates, meaning animals such as chimps can give birth relatively easily. The researchers devised a mathematical model using data from the World Health Organization and other large birth studies. They found opposing evolutionary forces in their theoretical study. One is a trend towards larger newborns, which are more healthy. However, if they grow too large, they get stuck during labour, which historically would have proved disastrous for mother and baby, and their genes would not be passed on. \"One side of this selective force - namely the trend towards smaller babies - has vanished due to Caesarean sections,\" said Dr Mitteroecker. \"Our intent is not to criticise medical intervention,\" he said. \"But it's had an evolutionary effect. \" Future trends The researchers estimated that the global rate of cases where the baby could not fit through the maternal birth canal was 3%, or 30 in 1,000 births. Over the past 50 or 60 years, this rate has increased to about 3.3-3.6%, so up to 36 in 1,000 births. That is about a 10-20% increase of the original rate, due to the evolutionary effect. \"The pressing question is what's going to happen in the future?\" Dr Mitteroecker said. \"I expect that this evolutionary trend will continue but perhaps only slightly and slowly. \"There are limits to that. So I don't expect that one day the majority of children will have to be born by [Caesarean] sections.\" The research is published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Commenting on the study, Smithsonian paleoanthropologist Dr Briana Pobiner said there are \"probably many other biological and cultural issues that factor into the Caesarean sections rate, which varies widely across the developed and developing world\". And Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians, said factors such as diabetes and obesity, are having an impact on the number of Caesarean sections. \"I think what is important to take into the [question of] evolution is that things like diabetes are much more common at a younger age so we see many more women of reproductive age who have diabetes,\" she said. \"That has consequences as to whether or not they may need a caesarean section. \"In addition, the rates of obesity are increasing so more and more women of reproductive age have a higher body mass index and this again has an impact on caesarean section rates.\" Follow Helen on Twitter.", "summary": "科学家们说，普遍使用剖腹产将影响到人类的进化。"}

Mrs Putin had rarely been seen in public in recent months, prompting much speculation in Russian media. She is known to dislike publicity, and told the TV reporter that flying was difficult for her. \"Vladimir Vladimirovich is completely drowned in work,\" she said. The divorce was \"civilised\" and the couple would \"always remain close\", she said. \"I am very grateful to Vladimir... that he still supports me. And the children, he really cares for them and the children feel this,\" she added. Mr Putin confirmed on TV that the two were no longer living together. \"We are always going to be very close to each other. I am sure, forever,\" he said. Vladimir Putin and Lyudmila Shkrebneva were married in 1983. They have two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, both in their 20s. \"Our children have grown up; they have their own lives,\" Mrs Putin added. She and Mr Putin were last seen together at his inauguration for his third term as president on 7 May 2012. Remarriage? Neither clarified whether or not their marriage had been legally dissolved, but Mrs Putin referred to the separation as a \"civilised divorce\". The announcement came after the couple had gone to see the ballet Esmeralda at the Kremlin Palace - they left after the first act. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says that Thursday's announcement confirms what had been rumoured for years, that the Putins were having marital problems. But the news has still come as a shock to many Russians, who are not used to their leaders getting divorced - even though Russia has one of the highest divorce rates in the world, our correspondent adds. The question already dominating the Russian blogosphere is, \"will Russia's president marry again?\", he says. The Putins' marriage had been the subject of speculation before.

In the UK, the 30% Club was set up in 2010 with the aim of having women make up at least 30% of the members on every board. In the US, the Thirty Percent Coalition - a group of people who are chief executives and chairs of their companies - was created to achieve the same thing. Of course, there are many other - and some say better - reasons to argue for gender equality, but we wanted to look at whether this broadly accepted claim is true - does having more women on the board really mean the company makes more money? Academics have warned against jumping to simple conclusions. A report published by Credit Suisse last year said companies with at least one woman director received a better return on their investments compared with companies with all-male boardrooms. They say companies where women made up at least 15% of senior management were 50% more profitable than those where fewer than 10% of senior managers were female. But Prof Alice Eagly, at Northwestern University in the US, says many of the studies commissioned by corporations are \"naive\" as they don't consider other variables. She explains that more sophisticated pieces of analysis carried out by academics have shown very small positive correlations between female board members and financial success. But this is an average - in some companies the relationship was neutral and in some it was negative. And proving causation is far harder. It is difficult to say that it is having more women on boards that makes companies do better, rather than other factors - something corporate reports acknowledge. This is because companies with more women on boards are different in other ways, too, according to Prof Eagly. For example, firm size seems to be one of the most significant factors in determining profitability. And larger companies are likely to employ more women at every level. More innovative companies were more likely to use their talent effectively, regardless of gender. And companies that were already more profitable may have been more able to focus efforts on diversity, she says. A study looking at the gender make-up of the top management of the US's biggest firms, not only their board members, found female representation in top management improves firm performance but only in companies that are \"focused on innovation\". 'Add women and stir' And, interestingly, female board members appear to have more of a positive impact on their company's performance in countries where women have more equal rights and treatment overall. It looks like there is a relationship between more successful companies and those with more women in senior positions in general, but it's not enough to simply \"add women and stir\", as Prof Robin Ely at Harvard Business School puts it. Another study from a group of German, Dutch and Belgian researchers found \"the mere representation of females on corporate boards is not related to firm financial performance if other factors are not considered\". It relies on there being a good company culture too. If women are in the minority in a room that is hostile to them, they are unlikely to be able to have a positive effect and that applies to other kinds of diversity too, the study suggests. Focusing on numbers without also addressing structural diversity issues is not enough, according to Prof Ely. Looking at how many spaces on a board are filled by women doesn't tell you how influential the board is, and it doesn't tell us whether those women are being listened to and allowed to have an impact, Prof Ely points out, as \"not all spots on a board are created equal\". There is some evidence that having three women on a board of 12 to 15 people is the tipping point for them to actually be heard and able to have an influence at all. So there are good arguments for the 30% rule - it just doesn't necessarily translate directly to profits. In fact Corinne Post, a professor of organisation management at Lehigh University, says that board members don't have a direct influence on the bottom line of a company, but they do have a greater influence on corporate social responsibility. She found that there was a five times stronger correlation between a company having female board members and stronger performance when it comes to ensuring they are environmentally friendly as a company, or involve themselves in philanthropy for example, than the correlation between female board members and profits. Profitability is highly complex and there's even evidence that chief executives might not have much of an influence on company profits. \"In companies with any women on their board at all, they tend to have between one and three - are you really saying the gender of three people on a board is going to have an impact on the bottom line?\" Prof Ely asks. For Northwestern's Prof Eagly, the most pertinent question is why we would need evidence women bring in more money than men, before they are given equal status on boards. \"Why should you rule out 50% of the population from important jobs. It's about social justice not about profits.\" Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter", "summary": "总是有不断的新闻头条报道称“公司董事会有女性，能让财务业绩表现更好”， 强调这个一定能引人遐想、引发争议的商业统计。"}

President Donald Trump's America First foreign policy has seen the US thumb its nose at multilateral agreements from the Paris Climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal, while China is visibly positioning itself as the new supporter of the United Nations. But growing Chinese influence comes at a price, and if Beijing is devoting more money to fund UN agencies like the World Health Organization then it will want more say as a result. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres spoke of a foundational moment facing the UN - those who built the United Nations knew the value of unity, he noted, since they had lived through war and an earlier pandemic. Anxieties about what the US China rivalry means for global stability abounded at this remote gathering of world leaders. There was no disguising the urgency of French President Emmanuel Macron's tone, as he said in his pre-recorded remarks that today's world can't be left to the rivalry between China and the US. That rivalry, which has seen the two countries lock horns on everything from trade to technology, is becoming increasingly acrimonious - and President Trump dialled up the rhetoric, using his platform on the world stage to rail against what he called the China virus. With less than 40 days to go until the US election, Bejing bashing is central to the Trump campaign. It appears there is a concerted effort under way to deflect criticism of the president's handling of the outbreak by slamming China for exporting the virus. Would a bi-polar world in which the US and China vie for supremacy eventually lead to military conflict? Clearly the UN Secretary General is concerned about what lies ahead, warning of another \"Cold War\". \"We are moving in a very dangerous direction,\" Mr Guterres said. \"Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities. A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geostrategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.\" This open discussion about the consequences of a \"great fracture \" shows how rapidly the world is changing, and how diplomats are scrambling to keep up. China's President Xi Jinping actually declared at the virtual general debate that \"China has no intention to fight either a Cold War or a hot one with any country.\" That statement was telling. The presidency of Donald Trump has heightened tensions with China, to the point where speculation about where all this leads is rife. An experienced diplomat told me on Tuesday that the general debate at the UN was always seen as creative chaos. As world leaders came together and glad handed and met in private, real diplomacy was done. Now, it's just chaos, said this old hand sadly, asking rhetorically who's in charge, and which world leader has more than just narrow self interest at heart. The pandemic has exploited the injustices of the world, observed the UN secretary general. People are hurting, our planet is burning, he said, imploring world leaders to see Covid-19 as a wake up call and a dress rehearsal for the challenges ahead. Yet within an hour of Mr Guterres saying solidarity is self-interest, President Trump declared that all world leaders should follow his example and put their countries first. If he is re-elected, his unilateralism will become more pronounced, and the United Nations will probably be further marginalised by Washington. Would the US commitment to NATO weaken too? Were Joe Biden to be elected president, the tension between Washington and Beijing might be lessened, but the fundamental US China rivalry would remain. The world is realigning, and the question now is how the old multilateral order adapts - and who will lead it.", "summary": "联合国迎来成立75周年纪念之际，当初促使联合国诞生的二战后全球秩序根基却出现了动摇。"}

He again predicted the infection would \"disappear,\" as the US hit a new record high of 52,000 virus cases in a day. His remarks to Fox News come a day after a top Republican called on Mr Trump to wear a mask as an example. The US now has nearly 2.7 million confirmed Covid-19 infections and more than 128,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic. What did the president say? Speaking to Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Mr Trump said: \"I'm all for masks.\" When asked whether he would wear one, the president said: \"If I were in a tight situation with people I would, absolutely.\" He added that people have seen him wearing one before. Mr Trump said he would have \"no problem\" with wearing a mask publicly and that he \"sort of liked\" how he looked with one on, likening himself to the Lone Ranger, a fictional masked hero who with his Native American friend, Tonto, fought outlaws in the American Old West. But the president reiterated that he did not think making face-coverings mandatory across the US was needed, because there are \"many places in the country where people stay very long distance\". \"If people feel good about it they should do it.\" Mr Trump was also asked in his Fox Business interview on Wednesday if he still believes coronavirus will \"disappear\" someday. \"I do,\" he said. \"I do. Yeah sure. At some point.\" During Mr Trump's forthcoming Independence Day celebration on 3 July at Mount Rushmore, his supporters in attendance will not be forced to wear masks or socially distance. What has Trump previously said about masks? When the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in April began recommending people wear masks or cloth coverings in public to help stop the spread of the virus, Mr Trump told reporters he would not follow the practice. \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it,\" he said back then. \"Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens - I just don't see it.\" But Mr Trump has repeatedly emphasised that choosing to follow the official health guidance around masks is a personal decision. Last month, he told the Wall Street Journal that some people only wore masks as a political statement against him. In May, during a visit to a factory in Michigan, he told reporters he took off a facial covering before facing the cameras because he \"didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it\". The White House has defended the president's choice by saying everyone in contact with him is tested frequently for coronavirus, and so is Mr Trump himself. The president's daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, has also been spotted wearing a mask in public. An ABC News/Ipsos poll found that in the last week, 89% of Americans said they wore a mask or face covering outside their home in the last week - a 20-point jump from mid-April. What are politicians saying? Mr Trump has often been criticised by Democrats for downplaying the need to wear masks and politicising the idea. But more recently, the president's fellow Republicans and conservative media have joined the calls in favour of mask wearing. They include Vice-President Mike Pence, who heads the US Covid-19 task force, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, Senator Mitt Romney and congresswoman Liz Cheney. On Tuesday, Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said it was unfortunate that \"this simple, lifesaving practice has become part of a political debate that says 'if you're for Trump, you don't wear a mask, if you're against Trump, you do\". The same day, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci told lawmakers new American cases could reach 100,000 per day, and not enough Americans were wearing masks or social distancing. The recent surges have led to a number of states reversing or pausing reopening plans. About 20 states have mandated mask wearing in public.", "summary": "一直反对在公共场合遮盖面部应对新冠疫情的美国总统特朗普最近改口表示，自己现在“完全支持戴口罩”，并说口罩令它看起来像一个“独行侠”。"}

Physical activity rivalled some heart drugs and outperformed stroke medicine. The findings suggest exercise should be added to prescriptions, say the researchers. Experts stressed that patients should not ditch their drugs for exercise - rather, they should use both in tandem. Prescriptions rise Too few adults currently get enough exercise. Only a third of people in England do the recommended 2.5 hours or more of moderate-intensity activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. In contrast, prescription drug rates continue to rise. There were an average of 17.7 prescriptions for every person in England in 2010, compared with 11.2 in 2000. For the study, scientists based at the London School of Economics, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine trawled medical literature to find any research that compared exercise with pills as a therapy. They identified 305 trials to include in their analysis. These trials looked at managing conditions such as existing heart disease, stroke rehabilitation, heart failure and pre-diabetes. When they studied the data as a whole, they found exercise and drugs were comparable in terms of death rates. But there were two exceptions. Drugs called diuretics were the clear winner for heart failure patients, while exercise was best for stroke patients in terms of life expectancy. Amy Thompson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said that although an active lifestyle brings many health benefits, there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the merit of exercise above and beyond drugs. \"Medicines are an extremely important part of the treatment of many heart conditions and people on prescribed drugs should keep taking their vital meds. If you have a heart condition or have been told you're at high risk of heart disease, talk to your doctor about the role that exercise can play in your treatment.\" Dr Peter Coleman of the Stroke Association said exercise alongside drugs had a vital role that merited more research. \"We would like to see more research into the long-term benefits of exercise for stroke patients. \"By taking important steps, such as regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking, people can significantly reduce their risk of stroke.\" \"Moderate physical activity, for example, can reduce the risk of stroke by up to 27%.\"", "summary": "英国一项研究显示，对于诸如有心脏疾患的人来说，运动可能同服药同样有效。"}

Chancellor George Osborne's review will cover spending after the next election. Mr Osborne originally predicted in 2010 that he could balance the budget within four years, but that is now not expected to happen until 2017-18. Higher taxes While the government has stuck to most of its plans from 2010, there has been less growth than expected, which has reduced the amount of money the government has taken in taxes. The think tanks warned that whoever is chancellor after the next election will probably have to raise taxes straight away. The warning of extended austerity was based on the experience in Canada in the 1980s and 1990s, when the government needed to bring the budget deficit under control. \"If the UK experience proves to be as drawn out as the Canadian one, we should expect not just 2015 but also 2020 to be an austerity election,\" the briefing said. A budget deficit exists when a government is spending more than it is raising. Agreed cuts Mr Osborne has already said how much government spending needs to be cut in 2015-16. The overall cut in the parts of spending that departments can influence will have to fall by 2.8%. But as a result of spending on health, education and international aid being protected, unprotected departments' spending will have to fall by 8% in the year. Those cuts for unprotected departments could be even more severe if the government decides to cut defence or home office spending by less than average. The chancellor announced at the end of May that he had already reached agreement with eight government departments to make cuts of between 8% and 10% in 2015-16. The departments that have agreed the cuts are: the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Energy and Climate Change, HM Treasury, the Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Northern Ireland Office.", "summary": "英国两个有影响力的智库警告说，英国的紧缩政策可能会持续到2020年选举的时候。"}

Lawyers are continuing to refer alleged abuse by soldiers to the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT). The Ministry of Defence said it took such allegations \"extremely seriously\". Two public inquiries have already looked at claims against UK troops in Iraq. Mr Warwick, a former police detective who is in charge of IHAT, told the Independent that the allegations being investigated included ones of murder. The inquiry has considered at least 1,515 possible victims, of whom 280 are alleged to have been unlawfully killed. 'Wholly unacceptable' Mr Warwick said: \"We would look at the credibility of the allegation in the first instance and, when we've looked at a lot of these extra cases coming to us, some of them are duplicates of cases, some of them we've already identified as part of our own investigation process, and some are multiple allegations, where we would investigate as a single allegation.\" IHAT's budget of £57.2m runs until the end of 2019 - 16 years after the invasion of Iraq began in 2003. \"Over the next 12 to 18 months, we will review all the caseload to better understand the picture and then I think we can say whether 2019 seems realistic,\" said Mr Warwick. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Warwick's comments may have been a response to an interview by Michael Fallon reported in the Telegraph. In it, the defence secretary said soldiers were inhibited on the battlefield because they feared \"ambulance-chasing British law firms\" would haul them in front of the courts on their return. Public Interest Lawyers, which represents some alleged victims, said IHAT was \"failing to investigate\" those responsible for \"systemic\" abuse. \"Despite public inquires, court proceedings ongoing since 2004 and the IHAT team of investigators, there is yet to be a single prosecution resulting from IHAT's work,\" a spokesman said. Carla Ferstman, director of the human rights charity Redress, told the Independent that the \"incredibly slow pace\" of IHAT's investigations was \"wholly unacceptable\". She added: \"Things seem to still be moving at a snail's pace. We call upon the government to ensure IHAT can, and does, do what it was set up to do, and to do it now. This cannot be a whitewash.\" Col Richard Kemp, a former army commander in Afghanistan, agreed that the investigation needed to be completed urgently, but said it was \"inconceivable\" that that number of allegations against British troops could be legitimate. \"Of course one has to be concerned about these allegations, but the number, the sheer number, thousands of allegations made against British soldiers in Iraq, I just cannot believe that any significant number of them can be valid,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Corporate failure' However, Dr Andrew Williams, from the University of Warwick, said the investigations could take \"some years more\", saying the process could \"drag out for a long time to come\". Dr Williams - who has written about the murder of Iraqi civilian Baha Mousa - said the \"lapse of time\" since the alleged crimes could hamper investigations. \"In terms of obtaining the witness testimony from the Iraqi civilians concerned, that will be tricky. They are obviously still based in Iraq and getting hold of them, interviewing them, is a long process and logistically very difficult.\" A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: \"The vast majority of UK service personnel deployed on military operations conduct themselves professionally and in accordance with the law. \"Where there is sufficient evidence, members of HM Forces can be prosecuted.\" An inquiry into claims of abuse by UK troops in Iraq highlighted the death of 26-year-old hotel worker Mr Mousa, who died in UK military custody in September 2003. It concluded in September 2011, with inquiry chairman Sir William Gage blaming \"corporate failure\" at the Ministry of Defence for the use of banned interrogation methods in Iraq. The Al-Sweady Inquiry, set up in 2009, followed allegations made in judicial review proceedings at the High Court that the human rights of several Iraqis were abused by British troops in the aftermath of a firefight with insurgents near the town of Majar al-Kabir. Inquiry chairman Sir Thayne Forbes said allegations that troops murdered and mutilated Iraqis in custody were \"wholly without foundation\".

It said it was clear that hackers wanted to undermine Mr Macron ahead of Sunday's second round vote. The centrist will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The documents were leaked on a file sharing website late on Friday and the Macron camp condemned the action just before the official campaigning period ended at midnight (22:00 GMT). Candidates and the media now face restrictions until the polls close on Sunday evening, meaning Mr Macron cannot issue further statements. Opinion polls had indicated the former economy minister carried a lead of 20 percentage points or more over Ms Le Pen, the National Front candidate. Separately it was reported that socialist legislator Corinne Erhel, 50, collapsed while speaking at a rally for Mr Macron in Plouisy, western France, on Friday and later died. What was released? About nine gigabytes of data were posted online by an anonymous user. Mr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an \"act of massive, co-ordinated hacking\". \"The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement,\" it said in a statement. The campaign said the documents showed only legitimate campaign activities. France's election commission warned that publication or republication of the leaked information could be a criminal offence. How did the leaks spread? The hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster. Within 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots. Some three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag. Who might be responsible? That too remains unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy, It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers. Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible. Is this unprecedented? Mr Macron's team has already been the victim of hacking attacks, for which it has blamed groups based in Russia and Ukraine. It suspects the Kremlin of wanting to help Ms Le Pen, who supports a pro-Moscow foreign policy. Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Mr Macron. On Thursday, the centrist candidate filed a lawsuit over online rumours that he had a secret bank account in the Caribbean. Mr Macron called the allegations \"fake news and lies\" and said some of the sites spreading them were \"linked to Russian interests\". What is at stake on Sunday? France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades. Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union. If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers. If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite. She wants a Europe of nations to replace the EU. After the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of US President Donald Trump, France is the latest country to deal a blow to politics as usual. What are the battleground issues? One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment, which stands at almost 10% and is the eighth highest among the 28 EU member states. One in four under-25s is unemployed. The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and all the leading candidates say deep changes are needed. Economic challenges facing next president Marine Le Pen wants the pension age cut to 60 and to \"renationalise French debt\", which she argues is largely held by foreigners. Emmanuel Macron wants to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs, reduce public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), plough billions into investment and reduce unemployment to below 7%. What the two candidates want What about security? The election is taking place amid a state of emergency, and the first round took place three days after a policeman was shot dead on the Champs Elysées in the heart of Paris. Some 50,000 police will be deployed across the country along with 7,000 troops involved in the anti-terror operation begun after the January 2015 Paris attacks, according to French media. More than 12,000 police and military will be on alert in the Paris area. The security forces will primarily guard polling stations and will be organised into \"dynamic patrols\" set to intervene immediately in any incident, Le Figaro newspaper reported. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks since January 2015 and officials fear more of the hundreds of young French Muslims who travelled to Syria and Iraq may return to commit new atrocities. Intelligence services believe attackers are deliberately pursuing a Le Pen victory, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris - because that could tip the country into chaos. Ms Le Pen wants to suspend the EU's open-border agreement on France's frontiers and expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services. What happens after Sunday? Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen came top of the 11 candidates in total who participated in the first round of voting on 23 April. While the outcome of Sunday's second round should be clear that evening, the results will be officially proclaimed by France's constitutional council on Thursday, 11 May.

Separate data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales showed the number of crimes had fallen 9% since a year ago. And the Home Office said the number of police officers had fallen to below 130,000 - 4,500 fewer than last year. Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the figures as \"good news\" at a time of police cuts and thanked the service for its efforts. \"We have asked them to do more with less resources. They have performed, I think, magnificently,\" he said. Labour welcomed the figures, but said there was \"worrying evidence\" the service provided by the police was \"being hollowed out\" with cuts to the number of officers. Despite the wider drop in recorded crime, one of the main categories to rise was \"theft from the person\" - including pick-pocketing and snatching of bags and mobile phones - up 9%. 'Great tribute' The stealing of phones out of people's hands as they walk along the street was a particular issue in London, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. Fraud offences have also seen a big rise, up 27%. Officials suggested this was due to changes in the way fraud was recorded, with a more centralised approach. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said it was also an indication more fraud was being committed online. Statisticians attributed the rise in sexual offences to the \"Yewtree effect\" - referring to Scotland Yard's operation set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal. They suggested the number of sexual offences reported could continue to rise over the coming months, as people come forward to report historic offences. The Crime Survey, which is based on people's experience of crime and includes offences which aren't reported, now shows offending is at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981. Our correspondent said levels of crime had been falling since the mid 1990s, but there were some indications the decrease may now be slowing. On LBC Radio, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said falling crime figures were \"one of the great triumphs of recent years\" and \"a great tribute to the police\". The Home Office has also released figures on the number of police officers, showing there were 129,584 officers at the end of March - 14,000 fewer than in 2010 and the lowest number of officers since 2002. Officer numbers fell in 37 of the 43 forces last year - with the largest percentage decreases in the City of London force and Staffordshire. In the Met there were 1,742 fewer officers. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the fall in crime, which she said was in line with longer-term trends. She added: \"The police are doing an impressive job in increasingly difficult circumstances... but Acpo have warned that the full effect of the cuts is not yet being felt. \"As the government has made it so much harder for the police, they should not try to take credit for the work the police and communities are doing.\"", "summary": "英国国家统计局最新公布的数字显示，英国英格兰和威尔士在截至今年3月份的过去一年中记录在案的犯罪案件减少了7%。"}

Boris Johnson, who is 55, has been discharged from St Thomas' hospital in London after being in intensive care. He was given oxygen, but didn't need a ventilator machine to help his breathing. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said male sex is \"a very clear risk factor\". But why? Which people can get sick? Some people are at higher risk of complications. This includes people over the age of 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as heart disease. There are more than 1.5 million people in the UK who are at the greatest risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus. This includes people with cancer who have been receiving chemotherapy, and they are being asked to stay at home all of the time to shield themselves from the virus. Coronavirus also appears to disproportionately affect men in their 50s and 60s to a certain degree, although they are not singled out as a high risk group. But it's not that clear-cut. Correlation isn't necessarily cause. Why older men? Scientists are unsure. UK data from intensive care hospital wards shows the average patient who is critically ill is aged 60. Most are men and many have other health conditions that could put them at increased risk, such as heart problems and obesity. Of the 647 coronavirus-related deaths registered by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales up to the week ending 27th March, 44 were aged 45-65 - around 7% of the total. Death rates go up with age in both men and women, but men tend to outstrip women across the ages. Data from China, where the pandemic began, also suggests men are at greater risk than women, although experts caution there could be factors other than gender, such as smoking habits, that could explain the link. Prof Ian Hall, Professor of Molecular Medicine, University of Nottingham, said: \"I am not convinced this completely explains the increased risk of severe disease in men, so it seems possible there may be some other as yet unidentified factor playing a role.\" Men are more likely than women to have heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease. Some have suggested genes and sex hormones might be involved too. Are women more immune? Prof Philip Goulder, an expert in immunology at University of Oxford, said: \"It is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases. \"The immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males.\" This could be down to women carrying two copies of the X chromosome, compared to the single X and a Y that men have. A number of critical immune genes are located on the X chromosome, he says. Is coronavirus causing the deaths? Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. People with underlying health conditions and the elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. The Office for National Statistics has been assessing how many of the deaths linked to coronavirus might be as a direct result of the virus. This analysis suggests that most (86% or 3,372) of the 4,000 deaths linked to coronavirus in March were likely caused by the virus, although around nine in every ten of those who died had a pre-existing health condition. The coronavirus death rate was twice as high for men compared to women - 97.5 deaths per 100,000 population versus 46.5 deaths per 100,000. How can you protect yourself? Stay as fit and healthy as you can by exercising and eating a balanced diet. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. Men are more likely than women to: Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. What if I get coronavirus symptoms? If you have a new, continuous cough or a fever you should stay at home and self-isolate for at least seven days. If you, or someone you live with, develop symptoms, the entire household needs to isolate for 14 days to monitor for signs of the disease. What should I do if my symptoms don't get better? The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what you need to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words then you will be told to call 999 as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then the website will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111.", "summary": "大多数感染新型冠状病毒的患者在症状出现大约一周左右就会恢复，不需要医疗照顾。"}

The Ukrainian authorities seem in no doubt as to what has happened. An adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, Anton Herashchenko, alleges that the plane was flying at an altitude of some 10,000m (33,000 ft). He says that it was hit by a missile fired by a Buk launcher. The Buk, also known by its Nato codename of Sa-11 Gadfly, is a Russian-made, medium-range surface-to-air missile system designed to defend against high-performance aircraft and cruise missiles.

Typically, four missiles are carried on board a tracked vehicle which also houses the guidance and tracking radar. A separate tracked vehicle carries the Snow Drift target acquisition radar. Sanctions pressure Everything will now depend upon obtaining accurate and verifiable data on the aircraft's last moments and on what brought it down. If it does turn out that the Boeing 777 was shot down by the separatists - with weaponry supplied by Moscow - then it could significantly alter the terms of the whole debate surrounding the Ukraine crisis. Over the past few days there has been growing concern among Western governments that Russia was stepping up its military support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine. Nato spokesmen insist that more and more heavy military equipment has moved from Russian stockpiles to the separatists across the border. In response, the United States has strengthened its economic sanctions against Moscow - it is threatening even stronger action - though the European Union has so far failed to follow Washington's lead. But if Russia in any way had a hand in this tragedy then the pressure - especially on the Europeans - for much tougher sanctions will only grow. It will also prompt a renewed push for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Moscow clearly does not want the separatists to be swept aside. But equally Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to have no clear game-plan as to what the end-state should be.", "summary": "民航客机在空中发生灾难事故极为罕见。"}

On Tuesday, Jolie's lawyer said Pitt had paid \"no meaningful child support\" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt's lawyers also said Jolie's claims regarding child support were a \"thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage\". Her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday: \"[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. \"Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,\" the documents stated. Responding to Pitt's rebuttal, Jolie's lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean said she hoped the dispute could be resolved \"without further delay or posturing\". \"A loan is not... child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate,\" she said. \"Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children's expenses. He has not. \"Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years.

Pitt was investigated for possible child abuse after losing his temper in front of some of the children, but was later cleared of the allegations. The couple were known as \"Brangelina\" by fans and met on the set of the 2005 film Mr and Mrs Smith.

This was prompted by intercepted conversations between two senior al-Qaeda figures, including top leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, US media said. The Pentagon said the US Air Force was flying workers out of the capital, Sanaa, on Tuesday morning. A global travel alert said: \"The US Department of State warns US citizens of the high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist activities and civil unrest. \"The department urges US citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those US citizens currently living in Yemen to depart immediately.\" It added that \"the security threat level in Yemen is extremely high\". It comes hours after a drone strike killed four suspected al-Qaeda militants in the country overnight, a senior US official has confirmed to the BBC. In a separate incident, tribesmen say they have shot down a Yemeni military helicopter, killing at least six troops. The BBC's Abdullah Ghorab, in Sanaa, says the Yemeni capital has been experiencing unprecedented security measures, with hundreds of armoured vehicles deployed. Our correspondent says a security source confirmed that Yemeni intelligence services had discovered that dozens of al-Qaeda members had arrived in Sanaa over the past few days in preparation for the implementation of a large plot. The source described the plot as dangerous, and suggested it was to include explosions and suicide attacks aimed at Western diplomatic missions and Yemeni military headquarters. A source in the Yemeni air force has told the BBC that Yemeni war planes have made regular flights to monitor movements of cells believed to belong to al-Qaeda in the areas of Shaouan and Thahban in Sanaa. Jail breaks Both the White House and the US state department have said the current threat comes from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but have refused to divulge further details. According to the New York Times, the US intercepted communications between Zawahiri and the group's head in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi. The paper said the conversation represented one of the most serious plots since the 9/11 attacks. Washington earlier said the closures in North Africa and the Middle East were \"out of an abundance of caution\". A number of US diplomatic posts in the region - including in Sanaa - will remain closed until Saturday. In a statement on its website, the UK Foreign Office said: \"Due to increased security concerns, all staff in the British embassy have been temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return.\" It advises against all travel to the country. Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. Officials have advised particular vigilance during the festival period surrounding Eid - the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan - warning that \"tensions could be heightened\". Eid will begin on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the sighting of the new moon. Meanwhile, Interpol issued a separate global security alert at the weekend, citing jail breaks linked to al-Qaeda in nine countries. The international policing organisation said \"hundreds of terrorists\" had been freed during breakouts in countries including Iraq, Libya and Pakistan in the past month. A US state department global travel alert, issued last week, is also in force until the end of August. AQAP, the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda, has also been blamed for the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit and for explosives-laden parcels that were intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights.", "summary": "美国和英国政府因为担心安全威胁，已将驻也门外交人员撤走，并再次敦促两国公民立即离开该国。"}

It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. \"It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face,\" Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. \"When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers,\" she said. \"You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you.\" What were the previous records? Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had \"serious credibility issues\". What about the heatwave? The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large \"firenado\" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning \"when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply\". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. What are the effects of extreme heat? Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.", "summary": "美国加利福尼亚死亡谷国家公园（Death Valley National Park）测得据信是地球上可靠记录的最高温度：54.4摄氏度（130华氏度）。"}

Rowling took legal action later that month against Gossage and his friend Judith Callegari, who had revealed the information during a Twitter exchange with journalist India Knight. Rowling accepted an apology from the law firm and substantial damages, in the form of a charity donation. In a ruling issued on 26 November but made public on 30 December, the SRA said that \"by disclosing confidential information about a client to a third party\" Gossage had breached several principles of its rules and code of conduct.

Jail records confirmed Murray's release and the sheriff's office said he left a Los Angeles jail at 12:01 on Monday. Jackson died on 25 June 2009 after receiving a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol from Murray. The singer had been out of the public eye for several years but was preparing for a series of comeback performances at the O2 arena in London and Murray was serving as his personal physician. Murray, 60, had been sentenced to serve four years behind bars, but a change in California law allowed his jail term to be significantly reduced. Licence revoked The former doctor's medical licences remain suspended or revoked in the US states where he previously practised medicine. According to ABC News, Murray's legal team is filing petitions in Texas to have his medical licence reinstated. \"He's pretty confident that he'll be able to practise medicine again somewhere,\" Murray's legal representative, Valerie Wass told the US broadcaster. Murray is also appealing against his conviction, although an appeals court has questioned whether it needs to hear the case. Murray previously maintained clinics in Houston and Las Vegas and complained on several occasions about conditions in jail following his conviction and before his sentencing. He was allowed to serve his entire sentence in a Los Angeles jail instead of a state prison due to a law which allowed nonviolent offenders to be moved to local prisons to limit overcrowding. ''Dr Murray has not received any special treatment in jail and in fact has many less privileges than most inmates because of his notoriety,'' Ms Wass said earlier this year. She said he was \"very much looking forward to his release and getting on with his life\". According to ABC News, Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, said the singer's family hopes Murray \"can never practise medicine again and will not violate his Hippocratic Oath and hurt another patient\". She filed a wrongful death suit against concert promoter AEG Live LLC in 2010, claiming that the company was negligent in hiring Murray to tend to her son.

There are no survivors, officials say. The \"black box\" flight recorder has been found, France's interior minister says. The cause of the crash is not known and the plane sent no distress signal during an eight-minute descent. Among the passengers were 16 German pupils returning from an exchange trip. Germanwings, a low-cost airline owned by Germany's main carrier Lufthansa, has an excellent safety record. French, Spanish and German leaders have expressed shock. A recovery team reached the site, in a remote mountain ravine, earlier on Tuesday. Their work was called off in the evening and will resume at first light on Wednesday, the French interior ministry said. Bruce Robin, a prosecutor from Marseille, told the Reuters news agency that he had seen the wreckage of the aircraft from a helicopter. \"The body of the plane is in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,\" he said. Key points What we know Crash updates German school's fears mount In pictures: Germanwings crash German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was also flown over the crash site and described it as \"a picture of horror\", the Associated Press news agency says. Officials believe 67 of those aboard the plane were German citizens. Forty-five of the passengers had Spanish names, Spain's deputy prime minister said. The passengers included a German school class on its way back from an exchange trip as well as two opera singers, Maria Radner and Oleg Bryjak. Ms Radner was travelling with her husband and baby. The flight was also carrying citizens of Australia, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it was \"sadly likely\" that some British nationals were on board. Sandrine Boisse, a tourism official from the ski resort of Pra Loup, told the BBC that she believed she had heard a strange noise in the mountains at around 11:00 (10:00 GMT). \"At first we thought it was on the ski slopes, an avalanche, but it wasn't the same noise,\" she said. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC Transport correspondent We know the aircraft went from a normal cruising height of 38,000 feet to crashing in the mountains in just eight minutes. One pilot told me that is twice the normal descent rate, but he also said that the aircraft is capable of coming down even more quickly and still being okay. In an emergency, the pilots' first priority is to fly the plane, but as soon as they have some control they are trained to make an emergency call. That didn't appear to happen in this case, which suggests the pilots were coping with something so catastrophic they never had time to radio in a mayday, or turn to find the nearest runway. It's still too early to know anything for certain, but that might point to both engines failing, a fuel problem or something critical breaking off the aircraft. The plane began descending one minute after it reached its cruising height and continued to lose altitude for eight minutes, Germanwings managing director Thomas Winkelmann told reporters. He said the aircraft lost contact with French air traffic controllers at 10:53 (09:53 GMT) at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane did not send out a distress signal, officials said. Earlier reports of a distress call, quoting the French interior ministry, referred to a message from controllers on the ground. The White House has said there is no evidence so far of a terror attack. A Lufthansa official said they were assuming for the time being that the crash had been caused by an accident.

Mr Kerry ran as Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His nomination comes after the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, withdrew from consideration last week. Republicans had fiercely criticised her role in the aftermath of the deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Influential senator Speaking at the White House, Mr Obama said Mr Kerry understood the need to \"harness all elements of American power\", and said the veteran senator was \"not going to need a lot of on-the-job training\". The president added that he was sure Mr Kerry would be swiftly confirmed in the Senate. Mrs Clinton, who is still recuperating from a stomach virus and concussion, was not present for the announcement. But in a statement, Mrs Clinton said Mr Kerry was an \"excellent choice\" of head for the state department. \"He will be able to sustain and extend America's global leadership,\" she said. Mr Kerry, 69, becomes Mr Obama's first new cabinet nomination since he won a second term in November. The president will also have to name a new defence secretary to replace Leon Panetta, and a new director of the CIA to take over from David Petraeus, who quit last month after admitting an affair. Mr Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, lost a close presidential election to George W Bush in 2004 and had been a contender for the state department in 2008, before Mrs Clinton was chosen. The BBC's Washington correspondent, Kim Ghattas, says Mr Kerry is well-steeped in the details of world affairs and diplomacy. She says he has been the Obama administration's unofficial envoy to various hotspots, from Pakistan to Afghanistan. If confirmed, he will face the problem of ongoing Syrian unrest and continuing concern over Iran's nuclear programme. Mrs Clinton has indicated she will step down early next year. Mr Kerry will have to give up his seat in the Senate, where he represents the state of Massachusetts. The Democrats may face a tough battle to keep it in the subsequent election. Analysts say Mr Kerry's nomination is unlikely to face opposition from Republicans, who had threatened to oppose Ms Rice, despite the president's strong defence of her actions over Libya. Mr Kerry himself had spoken up for Ms Rice, saying: \"I've defended her publicly and wouldn't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment. She's an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant.\" Ms Rice's troubles began days after the 11 September assault on the US consulate. She said in a series of TV interviews that it seemed to have developed out of protests over an anti-Islamic film. But later intelligence reports suggested the attack was carried out by al-Qaeda affiliates. Her comments triggered a major political row over who knew what and when, and whether the consulate was adequately protected. The attack left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.", "summary": "美国总统奥巴马提名民主党资深参议员约翰·克里（John Kerry）为新一任国务卿。"}

The November 2014 article described a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house in 2012. A four-month police investigation found no evidence that the incident occurred. However, police chief Timothy Longo said that did not mean \"something terrible didn't happen\" to the student known as Jackie. When the story was published, it prompted student protests and a renewed national debate about sexual violence at US college. The Columbia School of Journalism report, commissioned by Rolling Stone, described the article as \"a story of journalistic failure\". Written by journalist Sabrina Erdely, the 9,000-word article A Rape on Campus relied on Jackie as the sole source to tell the story of an alleged rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Subsequent investigations by other reporters and Ms Erdely herself identified errors in the reporting of the piece. The Columbia School of Journalism report said the magazine failed to use \"basic, even routine journalistic practice\" to verify the details after Ms Erdely failed to contact the alleged attackers. \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking\", and there were \"systematic failures\" at the magazine, the report said. The report went on to suggest that the article had undermined work to stop sexual violence as it \"spread the idea that many women invent rape allegations\". Mr Dana described the report as \"painful reading\", and said the magazine was committing itself to a series of recommendations in the report. He apologised to all those affected by the story, \"including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students\". \"Sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses, and it is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward,\" he added. \"It saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings.\" Ms Erdely also apologised in a statement released alongside the report. Columbia said that Jackie had declined to answer questions for the report and that her lawyer said it \"is in her best interest to remain silent at this time.\"", "summary": "美国著名通俗文化双周刊《滚石》（Rolling Stone）杂志，就去年发表的一篇关于大学校园轮奸案的失实报道公开道歉，并表示正式收回文章。"}

The operation will take place on Friday under general anaesthetic. It is a planned, not an emergency, admittance. Prince Philip, who will be 92 on 10 June, pulled out of an official engagement earlier this week. In the past week, the duke has been having unannounced \"abdominal investigations\" at the hospital in central London, said BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt. The Palace said in a statement that \"further updates will be issued when appropriate\". On Monday, Prince Philip pulled out of an engagement for the Royal National Institute of Blind People after becoming unwell ahead of last week's service marking 60 years since the Queen's coronation. Philip attended the service at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday and was present at a garden party attended by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Guests said he gave no signs of being unwell. According to the BBC's royal correspondent, Prince Philip was driven to the clinic after the party and walked in unaided. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"He is in very good health.\" She added: \"He felt unwell on Monday and missed an engagement, but that was down to the fact he had temporarily lost his voice.\" A Palace spokesman at the London Clinic described the Duke of Edinburgh as being in good spirits. The spokesman stressed it was not an emergency admission and the decision was taken by the duke's doctors to carry out the exploratory operation after investigations and tests last week. Police officers were standing guard outside the hospital ahead of Philip's operation. In April, Buckingham Palace played down fears about the Duke of Edinburgh's health after he was pictured with purplish skin round his eye in Canada. It said he did not fall and simply woke up with the discoloration. Prince Philip, 91, has been admitted to hospital three other times in the past two years after suffering health scares. In August 2012, he was treated at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a bladder infection. He spent four days in hospital over Christmas 2011, following an operation to clear a blocked heart artery. After attending events to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June, he was admitted to hospital for five nights missing several days of festivities after sustaining a bladder infection. Writing on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"My best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh who is in hospital tonight. I hope he has a swift recovery.\" On Friday, Prince Philip was due to accompany the Queen when she officially opens the BBC's New Broadcasting House building in central London. The Queen will now undertake the visit alone. Philip was at the Queen's side at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday for the coronation service and on Wednesday toured a Victorian steamship, the SS Robin, in London's East End. Ahead of the garden party, the Queen invested her husband with New Zealand's highest honour to mark the Diamond Jubilee making him an additional member of the Order of New Zealand. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Duke of Edinburgh would miss the Trooping the Colour parade on 15 June, marking the Queen's official birthday. Camilla Tominey, royal editor for the Daily Express, told the BBC: \"Obviously he was at the garden party this afternoon, so he must have known that he was going into hospital later that day, but decided to carry ahead with that engagement. \"Naturally, Buckingham Palace is reluctant to go into too much detail because it concerns a key member of the royal family's health and personal affairs.\"", "summary": "白金汉宫确认，英国女王的夫君爱丁堡公爵因膀胱感染，被送往医院治疗。"}

She shared the details of her loo paper adventure to reporters over the weekend, instantly making her a laughing stock on social media. \"I'm laughing so hard, I'm on the floor,\" a user called Robhimx wrote on Twitter. Mrs Lam is currently seen as Beijing's top pick to become Hong Kong's chief executive, the highest position in the city. But many are now questioning her common sense and her knowledge of the city. Some wondered why she couldn't simply ask the housekeeping staff of her serviced residence for toilet paper. Or, when she found her local convenience store had no loo paper, why she didn't purchase the ubiquitous tissue packets for temporary use. \"So, where did she get her toilet paper BEFORE she moved into the government house?\" asked another online commentator. A few hours before the taxi trip, the former chief secretary had moved out of her government-assigned quarters to live as a civilian, as part of plans to contest the chief executive election in March. \"A lot has happened in my life in the last few days,\" she told reporters. \"I have to keep adapting to the changes, and to keep learning.\" Mrs Lam, who comes from a working-class background, became a civil servant in 1980 before rising to the chief secretary position, which came with many perks including housing and chauffeured cars. After so many years as a sheltered civil servant, some wonder if she is too out of touch to run a city of seven million people. \"Loo paper-gate\", as it is being called online, was not Mrs Lam's first gaffe. She was criticised last week for appearing not to know how to pass through a turnstile at a Hong Kong subway station. The station is part of a network that carries nearly five million passengers every day. Television footage shows her pausing at the turnstile, before an assistant tells her to walk through. Her blunders have become a popular talking point in Hong Kong's free-wheeling media. Joseph Lam, a lawyer and blogger, has posted a parody video on his Facebook page, in which he holds a basket with napkins while speaking with former judge Woo Kwok-hing, who also intends to run for the chief executive position. And another contender, former security chief Regina Ip, was quizzed on her transport knowledge during a live radio programme. When the presenter asked whether she was familiar with public transport, Mrs Ip held up two Octopus cards - pre-paid electronic cards used for everything from buses to trains to groceries. She proudly said she knew exactly how to use them and how to walk through turnstiles. The race for chief executive hasn't officially begun, but the campaign for hearts and minds has.

The areas include Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and parts of Cheshire, Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and East Sussex. A controversial badger cull is set to go ahead this year in two pilot areas. The new measures are for the so-called edge area, the boundary between the high-risk area for bovine TB (predominantly in the South West, West Midlands and parts of East Sussex) and the low risk area, in the North and East of England. Under the stricter regime, farms in Cheshire and Derbyshire within a radius of 3km (almost two miles) of a new TB outbreak on a farm will have to immediately test herds for bovine TB and again after six months. Elsewhere, farmers will be required to supply two further clean tests after an outbreak before restrictions are lifted. They will also need to use the gamma interferon test for spotting TB infection, which is more sensitive than the standard tuberculin skin one. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said there will also be more monitoring of TB infection in badgers, through post-mortems on badgers killed on the road. Meanwhile, farmers wishing to vaccinate badgers on their land will be able to apply for money from a £250,000 fund to help cover half the costs of the first year of the project. New strategy Last month, the government announced a new long-term strategy for the control of bovine TB in England, pulling together various policies, involving the government, the farming industry, vets and scientists. It focuses on the idea of dividing the country into three areas - low-risk, high-risk and the edge between the two - and tackling each with different interventions. In the high-risk area, badger culling has been authorised at two pilot sites in west Somerset and in and around west Gloucestershire. Under the proposals, about 5,000 badgers will be culled by free shooting before the end of the year. Ministers say the action is needed to help tackle the cattle disease, which has been steadily rising since the 1980s. Campaigners against the cull say it will have no impact on bovine TB, and could lead to local populations of badgers being wiped out. Vaccination of badgers is already under way in Wales as an alternative to culling. A similar vaccine for cattle exists, but its use is prohibited by EU regulations. Scotland has been officially TB-free since 2009.", "summary": "英国政府进一步采取措施，试图限制新型冠状病毒疫情的扩散。"}

By contrast, Starship's ground-based robots will be kept under close supervision by human operators. Each supervisor will watch over three robots via their on-board cameras and take control of road-crossings and other challenging situations.

It wants you to be able to summon a car, have it arrive in less than five minutes, and take you where you want to go. In major cities it has just about hit that goal. The average time for being picked up by an Uber is less than five minutes. This week, the company began a scheme that gave all residents in a small San Francisco community $100 (£68.50) every month to spend on Uber.

Six months into his presidency, how is he faring in these areas? And how much is he tweeting about these policy priorities? 1. Jobs During the campaign, Mr Trump vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become \"the greatest jobs president... ever\". In the past he discredited US jobless figures, claiming the actual unemployment rate was over forty per cent. Now he's America's CEO, he's embracing the same figures he once described as \"phony\". So, are the jobs numbers \"great\", as his tweet suggests? Yes - the jobs market is looking healthy, with the overall trend showing that unemployment is falling. The president is also right when he says there are more jobs around - in June 222,000 jobs were created. But this steady economic performance isn't a drastic change from what we saw under President Barack Obama, when job growth increased at a steady pace. One area where that growth isn't being matched is in wages, and there have been calls for President Trump to address this issue. Then there's his promise to bring more jobs back to the US from overseas - a pledge which energised much of his base. Shortly after his election victory he spoke of how he had saved 1,100 jobs with the Indiana based air conditioner firm, Carrier. Months later, 600 of those jobs are still moving to Mexico. Other companies like Ford are expanding production overseas, rather than in the US. Despite the president's assurances he would reverse what he described as \"job theft\" overseas, it's proving difficult. 2. Economy The latest growth figures, released since President Trump took office, showed a decline in the GDP rate (1.4%) in the first three months of this year, compared with the three months preceding (2.1%). It was one of the worst readings for nearly a year, but not necessarily bad news for President Trump, as economists say the first quarter of the year usually posts a lower rate. Overall, the president is correct when he characterises the US economy as \"strong\". Upward growth is part of a trend, in which the US economy has picked up since the financial crisis in 2008. The White House has set a growth target of 3%, but this does look like a challenge, as growth has only averaged less than 2% a year since 2001. The Congressional Budget Office currently estimates growth at about 1.9%. President Trump often boasts about how the stock market has risen since he took office. He can take credit for this in part. Some of the improvement in the markets can be attributed to anticipation that the president and the Republican pledge to reduce taxes and cut regulations will be implemented. But he's still not managed to pass tax reform laws. What will Trump's tax plan actually do? 3. Fighting Islamic State During the campaign Donald Trump didn't mince his words when it came to so-called Islamic State (IS), famously using an expletive to describe how much bombing he would carry out. He added: \"I'd just bomb those suckers. I'd blow up the pipes, I'd blow up the refineries, I'd blow up every single inch - there would be nothing left.\" Back then Mr Trump was wary to reveal details but promised he had a \"secret plan\". Since entering office, he has ordered a review of US policy on IS. Despite criticising his predecessor's handling of the militant group (\"he's the founder of ISIS\"), the Trump administration's strategy is strikingly similar. It includes continuing strikes and targeted raids, more support to local forces, and freezing the assets of IS operatives. The goals are the same too - to take control of IS strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq - and coalition forces have already seen success in the latter. But there are some key differences in tactics. One is the decision to arm Syrian Kurds to help take Raqqa, despite objections from the Turkish government. The second is a tougher stance on \"annihilating\" IS fighters, which has led to a rise in the number of civilian casualties caught up in attacks. The third is that the Trump administration is authorising a far greater number of air strikes as it makes its push, and has ramped up operations against IS in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. In Afghanistan his administration dropped the \"Mother of All Bombs\" to kill IS militants. And, when President Trump authorised a strike against a chemical weapons factory in Syria earlier this year, he showed he's not afraid to use military force when he feels it is necessary. It shows another key difference between him and his predecessor Barack Obama, who promised such action, but didn't deliver. 4. The border Securing America's borders was the centrepiece of Donald Trump's election pitch. At campaign rallies he promised to crack down on illegal immigrants in the US, with his focus on criminals. He often raised the case of Kate Steinle, a young woman from Seattle who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. Six things that could topple Trump's wall At the end of June he introduced \"Kate's law\" which would increase penalties for immigrants who re-enter the US after they've been deported. It was passed by the House of Representatives, and will now come before the Senate. In the president's first 100 days, more than 41,000 people were arrested on the suspicion they were in the US illegally, an increase on the previous year. About 10,800 had no criminal conviction, compared with 4,200 the previous year. But despite his tough talk on the issue, President Trump actually deported fewer people in his first 100 days than Barack Obama. In Trump's first 100 days 54,564 people were deported, compared with 62,062 for the same time period in the previous year under his predecessor. And let's not forget Donald Trump's plans to tighten the border even further - his flagship plan to \"build a wall\" is moving along. Companies have until September to pitch their prototypes. At a recent rally in Iowa, the president said it could be a \"solar wall\" which would pay for itself. For months the president's travel ban was blocked by the courts and failed to become law. After a decision by the US Supreme Court in June, it's partially in effect, but it's not as drastic. Visitors from the six designated countries can still enter, if they have a bona fide connection to the US.

The death toll from the Philippines has now risen to at least 59. Most died in landslides caused by heavy rain. Mangkhut, considered the strongest storm of 2018, ploughed through the northern Philippines on Saturday. What's the impact in China? Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on the Chinese coast near Jiangmen city on Sunday afternoon local time, state media reported. More than 2.45 million people have been relocated, and authorities there issued their highest warning level, a red alert. In Hong Kong, authorities also issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (177 kph). Officials put the number of injured at more than 200 but the territory avoided the worst of the storm. Water levels surged by almost 3.5 m (12 ft) in places and live fish were washed on to the streets. Most shops and public services were shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. \"I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,\" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Mangkhut is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday as it moves inland. How badly has the Philippines been hit? Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. One of the worst incidents was in Itogon municipality, where accommodation for miners was crushed by a large landslide, killing at least 26, according to police. Eight more people are missing there. Officials say that two first responders reported on Saturday to have been killed in a landslide in Cordillera province have been accounted for. The BBC's Howard Johnson travelled 80km (50 miles) from the city of Tuguegarao to Aparri on the northern coast. He describes a trail of destruction along the route - forests ripped to shreds, electricity poles felled and crops eradicated. There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Preparation and evacuation procedures have improved since Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 which killed more than 7,000 people. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. Ask a question Share this chatbot. How have you been affected by the typhoon?

The statistics, from monitoring service Musicmetric, conclude that in the first half of 2012, UK users illegally shared over 40 million albums and singles. Industry group, the BPI said it showed piracy \"remains a significant problem\". The data, collected independently by Musicmetric and seen exclusively by the BBC, is believed to be the biggest analysis of its kind to be conducted. It monitored the global activity of BitTorrent files - a method of obtaining files by downloading from many users at the same time. The data's release came as measures to attempt to curb illegal downloading began to take hold, such as the blocking of popular piracy websites and the relegation and removal of search results from Google. Musicmetric's findings said that singer Ed Sheeran was the most pirated act in the UK for the first half of 2012, followed by hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks and Barbadian megastar Rihanna. The data suggested that Ed Sheeran's 2011 album + (Plus) was illegally downloaded an average of 55,512 times every month, and was the most popular download in over 460 towns and cities in the UK. Legal UK sales of his album in the first half of 2012 hit the 448,000 mark - making it the fourth most popular album behind releases from Adele, Emeli Sande and Lana Del Rey. Who is the most illegally shared artist in your area? Download nation Globally, the research suggested that the UK is a significant player on the world stage as a country of illegal music downloaders. The country was placed second in the world in terms of pure volume of illegal activity, with Musicmetric logging 43,263,582 downloads in the first six months of this year. The US topped the list, with 96,681,133 downloads tracked in the same period. Italy (33,158,943), Canada (23,959,924) and Brazil (19,724,522) made up the remainder of the top five. Rihanna's latest album - Talk That Talk - was found to be the world's most pirated release - Musicmetric tracked 1,228,313 downloads for the title in the first half of 2012. In its analysis of the UK's data, Musicmetric has estimated that 345 million individual tracks made up the torrent files downloaded by British music fans. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the UK's music industry body, the figures were having a \"significant effect on investment in new music\". \"According to their data, there are more illegal downloads in the UK still than there are legal purchases,\" the BPI's chief executive Geoff Taylor told the BBC. \"[It] compares to about 240 million tracks that were sold legally. A lot of people are getting very rich from stealing other people's things. \"That's wrong, and we think that musicians deserve to be paid for what they do, just like everyone else.\" However, Loz Kaye, leader of the Pirate Party UK - who will be attempting to become Manchester's next MP in the next election - said the complaints of record labels is \"protectionism\". \"We need to remove the barriers for actual artists to connect with their business and their fans,\" he told the BBC. \"The truth is, why [music industry figures] are complaining so much is that with a properly functioning internet, and a properly functioning economy, the big players are no longer necessary.\"", "summary": "BBC所做的一份调查显示，曼彻斯特是英国的音乐盗版之都。"}

Mexican officials have accused Mr Abarca of ordering police to confront the students on the day of their disappearance on 26 September. Eyewitnesses described seeing them being bundled into police cars. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto praised the work of prosecutors and the security forces. \"I hope that [the couple's] arrest will clarify many points being investigated by federal prosecutors,\" Mr Pena Nieto said. Unknown whereabouts Mexican officials had issued an arrest warrant for Mr Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, after Iguala police officers said they had received an order from the mayor to intercept the students. The officers said they had been told to stop the students from interrupting a speech given by Ms Pineda in Iguala on that day. \"This was the missing piece. This arrest will help us find our kids,\" Felipe de la Cruz, a parent of one of the missing told Milenio television. The students, from a nearby teacher training college, had travelled to Iguala to raise funds and protest. They have not been seen since. A search has uncovered a series of mass graves in the area, but initial tests suggested they were not those of the students. Since then, more bodies have been uncovered and officials have cast doubt on the accuracy of the initial tests. More forensic tests are currently being carried out.

They did not resist arrest. They have been taken for questioning. Officials hope they will be able to shed light on the whereabouts of the students. Public outrage The events of 26 September have shocked Mexicans and have led to mass protests demanding that the authorities do more to find the missing students. The 43 were part of a larger group which had gone to Iguala to protest against what they said were discriminatory hiring practices. The students all attended a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa with a history of left-wing activism, and their presence in Iguala raised alarm bells with the local authorities. When the students boarded busses to return to their college, they were stopped by police - allegedly on the orders of Mayor Abarca. The officers opened fire and killed three students and three people in nearby vehicles. They stopped one busload of students trying to flee and took them to a local police station. According to police officers detained as part of the investigation, they then handed the students over to a local drugs gang. The gang's leader, who has also been arrested, says he ordered the students be \"made to disappear\", after having been told they belonged to a rival gang. However, he did not specify further what happened to them. The gang leader also accused Ms Pineda of being \"the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala\".

The number of people in employment in the economy fell in the three months to July, by 69,000 to 29.17 million. Private sector \"Clearly this is a very unwelcome set of figures. Any increase in unemployment is something we really don't want to see happen,\" said Employment Minister Chris Grayling. He said the data would \"reinvigorate\" the government's \"determination\" to take steps to get the economy growing and create private sector jobs. The government is looking to the private sector to offset job losses in the public sector resulting from its wide-ranging programme of spending cuts, designed to reduce the UK's debt levels. Mr Grayling reiterated the government's determination to continue with its programme of cuts, as the alternative of borrowing more money was not a credible solution. Analysts said the unemployment figures reflected weak economic growth. \"Today's data provide further evidence that the fading of the UK's economic recovery is having increasingly severe effects on the labour market,\" said Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics. \"Continued rises in unemployment in the coming months seem likely.\" However, some argued that, given the current economic environment, the figures were not as bad as could have been expected. \"The biggest surprise has been the resilience of the labour market given how weak growth has been,\" said Ross Walker at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

It is now being used to identify people at borders, unlock smart phones, spot criminals, and authenticate banking transactions. But some tech firms are claiming it can also assess our emotional state. Since the 1970s, psychologists say they have been able to detect hidden emotions by studying the \"micro expressions\" on someone's face in photographs and video. Algorithms and high definition cameras can handle this process just as accurately and faster, tech firms say. \"You're already seeing it used for commercial purposes,\" explains Oliver Philippou, an expert in video surveillance at IHS Markit. \"A supermarket might use it in the aisles, not to identify people, but to analyse who came in in terms of age and gender as well as their basic mood. It can help with targeted marketing and product placement.\" Market research agency Kantar Millward Brown uses tech developed by US firm Affectiva to assess how consumers react to TV adverts. Affectiva records video of people's faces - with their permission - then \"codes\" their expressions frame by frame to assess their mood. \"We interview people but we get much more nuance by also looking at their expressions. You can see exactly which part of an advert is working well and the emotional response triggered,\" says Graham Page, managing director of offer and innovation at Kantar Millward Brown. More controversially, a crop of start-ups are offering \"emotion detection\" for security purposes. UK firm WeSee, for example, claims its AI tech can actually spot suspicious behaviour by reading facial cues imperceptible to the untrained eye. Emotions, such as doubt and anger, might be hidden under the surface in contrast to the language a person is using. WeSee says it has been working with a \"high profile\" organisation in law enforcement to analyse people who are being interviewed. \"Using only low-quality video footage, our technology has the ability to determine an individual's state of mind or intent through their facial expressions, posture, gestures and movement,\" chief executive David Fulton tells the BBC. \"In future, video cameras on a tube station platform could use our tech to detect suspicious behaviour and alert authorities to a potential terrorist threat. \"The same could be done with crowds at events like football matches or political rallies.\" But Mr Philippou is sceptical about the accuracy of emotion detection. \"When it comes simply to identifying faces, there are still decent margins of error - the best firms claim they can identify people with 90%-92% accuracy. \"When you try assess emotions, too, the margin of error gets significantly bigger.\" That worries privacy campaigners who fear facial recognition tech could make wrong or biased judgements. \"While I can imagine that there are some genuinely useful use-cases, the privacy implications stemming from emotional surveillance, facial recognition and facial profiling are unprecedented,\" says Frederike Kaltheuner of Privacy International. Straightforward facial recognition is controversial enough. When revellers attended BBC Radio 1's Biggest Weekend in Swansea in May, many will have been unaware that their faces were being scanned as part of a huge surveillance operation by South Wales Police. The force had deployed its Automated Facial Recognition (AFR) system, which uses CCTV-type cameras and NEC software to identify \"people of interest\", comparing their faces to a database of custody images. One man on an outstanding warrant was identified and arrested \"within 10 minutes\" of the tech being deployed at the music festival, says Scott Lloyd, the AFR project leader for South Wales Police. But human rights group Liberty points out that the tech has yielded large numbers of \"false positive\" matches at other events, such as the Champions League final in Cardiff last year. And in July, Cardiff resident Ed Bridges - represented by Liberty - began legal action against the force, arguing that AFR violated people's privacy and lacked proper scrutiny, paving the way for a High Court battle. But the technology is becoming more reliable, says Patrick Grother, head of biometric testing at the National Institute of Standards & Technology, a US federal agency that conducts research into facial recognition. He attributes the recent technological progress to the development of \"convolutional neural networks\" - an advanced form of machine learning that enables a much greater degree of accuracy. \"These algorithms allow computers to analyse images at different scales and angles,\" he says. \"You can identify faces much more accurately, even if they are partially obscured by sunglasses or scarves. The error rate has come down ten-fold since 2014, although no algorithm is perfect.\" WeSee's Mr Fulton says his tech is simply a tool to help people assess existing video footage more intelligently. He adds that WeSee can detect emotion in faces as effectively as a human can - \"with around 60%-70% accuracy\". More Technology of Business \"At the moment we can detect suspicious behaviour, but not intent, to prevent something bad from happening. But I think this is where it is going and we are already doing tests in this area.\" This sounds a step closer to the \"pre-crime\" concept featured in the sci-fi film Minority Report, where potential criminals are arrested before their crimes have even been committed. A further concern for civil liberties organisations? \"The key question we always ask ourselves is: Who is building this technology and for what purposes?\" says Privacy International's Frederike Kaltheuner. \"Is it used to help us - or to judge, assess and control us?\"", "summary": "人脸识别技术正在变得越发成熟。一些公司声称，这一技术甚至能够解读我们的情绪并监测到可疑行为。不过，这对隐私和公民自由会产生何种影响？"}

Thursday's referendum result means the UK will need to renegotiate its trade relationship with the European Union - including whether it remains part of the single market. HSBC declined to comment. Chris Cummings, chief executive of financial lobby group TheCityUK, said it was focused on securing continued access to the single market and warned of the risk of \"prolonged uncertainty\" while a new relationship with the EU was negotiated. Eurozone leaders have warned that without unrestricted access to the EU, London's big finance firms could move operations outside the UK. The head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said limited access to the single market would be the \"price\" of the UK leaving the EU. If the UK was not in the single market or the European Economic Area (EEA), it would mean the loss of \"passporting\", which allows banks to operate without restriction in all EEA countries. The EEA comprises the 28 members of the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. EEA rules allow those non-EU countries to be part of the EU's single market, as long as they allow full freedom of movement of people. The head of France's central bank, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, also warned that London's banks would lose their \"financial passport\" outside the single market or EEA. John Cryan, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said he thought London would lose some of its status as a financial hub. \"The financial centre won't die, but it will get weaker,\" he told German business newspaper Handelsblatt. Mr Cryan did not comment on the possible impact of the leave decision on Deutsche Bank, which employs at least 11,000 staff in the UK. Meanwhile, sources at Standard Chartered told the BBC it was unlikely that the Asia-focused bank would move any staff from London. Job cuts Leave campaigners have dismissed concerns of widespread job losses, saying Britain should focus on developing trade relationships with non-EU countries. Gerard Lyons, a UK economist who backed the Leave camp, said London would not be displaced as Europe's financial centre. \"We have the depth of skills, knowledge and experience that's hard to replicate,\" said Mr Lyons, an economic advisor to Boris Johnson. Passporting for finance firms is a \"negotiable issue\" with the EU, he said, particularly as several European banks also use those rules to access the UK. HSBC already has more than 10,000 staff working in Paris. The London-based bank has about 48,000 UK workers across its retail and investment banking operations. A year ago, it said it was planning to cut 8,000 jobs in the UK to reduce costs. Earlier this year, the bank said it would keep its global headquarters in London, following a review. On Friday, sources told the BBC that up to 2,000 jobs at the US investment bank Morgan Stanley could be moved from London to Dublin or Frankfurt. Morgan Stanley denied that jobs will be moved. What is passporting? Andrew Walker, World Service economics correspondent Banks and other financial companies can be authorised to do business in one member state of the EU, or the slightly wider European Economic Area (EEA), and then ply their trade across the region without having to be separately authorised in each country. The EEA is a grouping made up of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein who have access to the EU's single market. A bank using this system can provide services by offering them from its home base to a customer in another country, or it can establish a branch abroad. It is widely used by financial firms (not just banks) in the EU. It is also used by companies from outside the EEA, such as Switzerland and the US. They establish themselves in one place in the EU, typically in London as the continent's dominant financial centre, and use that as their headquarters for selling services across the single market. If the banking passport is no longer available to British-based firms, then some operations would clearly have to shift to a location inside the EEA. What is impossible to judge is just how much business, and how many jobs, would be affected. Would any shift be narrowly focussed on those functions serving EEA customers? Or would firms find it more cost effective to move other parts of the business as well?

Mr Hanlin said he would not confirm the name, adding: \"I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.\" Warning The gunman was reportedly born in the UK and moved to the US as a young boy. A man identified as the gunman's father, Ian Mercer, told US media he was \"just as shocked as everybody\" by his son's actions. The killer's motive is not known, although police said they were investigating reports that he had warned of his intentions on social media. What we know about Chris Harper Mercer Hours after the attack, in which seven were also injured, a visibly frustrated President Barack Obama demanded tighter gun laws, saying prayers are \"no longer enough\". Such shootings - and his own response - had become routine, he said, barely concealing his exasperation. \"We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. \"But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these mass shootings every few months.\" Referring to a BBC interview in which he talked about this, he said countries like the UK and Australia showed that effective legislation was possible. Obama's 'hopeless' push for gun control Lorie Andrews, who lives opposite the campus, said she heard what sounded like fireworks and when she came out of her home she saw students streaming out. \"One girl came out wrapped in a blanket with blood on her,\" she said. Hannah Miles, 19, said that she and fellow students were led to a nearby bookshop, where they hid in a back room. \"No-one really was sure what was going on,\" she said. \"The next thing we knew, there were three or four more gun shots and everybody just looked at each other - and we knew.\" Stacy Boylan, the father of a woman who survived the shooting, told CNN that his daughter had described how the gunman asked his victims to state their religion before opening fire. According to Mr Boylan, his daughter said the gunman told the Christians he killed that they were about \"going to see God in just about one second\". Another student who survived the shooting, Kortney Moore, gave a similar account to a local newspaper, The News-Review. The 3,000-student school is located in Roseburg, Oregon, a rural area about 175 miles (280 km) south of Portland. Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil in a Roseburg park in the evening. In audio from police radio channels an officer can be heard saying the suspect was down and that there were \"multiple gunshot wounds\", and calling for multiple ambulances to go the scene. The suspect supposedly used a \"long gun\". Students were transported by bus to a local fairground to be reunited with their loved ones.

The TUC, which organised the protests under the slogan \"Britain Needs a Pay Rise\", said between 80,000 and 90,000 people ha taken part in the London march. There has been no independent confirmation of this. The march in London was \"very peaceful and well organised\", the Metropolitan Police said. 'End the lock-out' Leaders of some of the UK's biggest trade unions criticised the government, saying pay had fallen despite the economic upturn. Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said the \"best thing\" the government could do was \"recognise the value of the masses of people here today who have suffered and give them a pay rise\". \"Our members didn't cause this recession, our members didn't cause the failures of the banks,\" he said. The TUC says average wages have fallen by £50 a week in real terms since 2008. The union's general secretary Ms O'Grady said: \"Our message is that after the longest and deepest pay squeeze in recorded history, it's time to end the lock-out that has kept the vast majority from sharing in the economic recovery.\" Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said Labour should support workers by offering a \"clear socialist alternative\" to the Conservatives at the next election. \"I say to Labour - stop being scared of your own shadow. Don't shrink what you offer the British people,\" he said. Ms O'Grady said top directors were being awarded 175 times more than the average worker, while five million people were earning less than the living wage. \"If politicians wonder why so many feel excluded from the democratic process, they should start with bread and butter living standards,\" she said. GMB union general secretary Paul Kenny said members' living standards were still falling. \"People are currently facing the biggest squeeze on their incomes since Victorian times, and wages have fallen in real terms every year since 2010,\" he said. Case study: 'My lifestyle is pressured' Mick Bowman, 56, is a mental health social worker for Northumberland County Council who lives in Newcastle and is taking part in the march in London. \"I've not had a pay rise for four years so with the cost of living rising, that's a very substantial pay cut,\" he said. \"At the same time my workload has increased and my job's become more stressful. \"At the end of every pay month I have to use my credit card to live on. I last had a holiday three years ago. So my lifestyle is pressured. \"I feel extremely angry about this. The national deficit was manageable and the way to deal with it is not to cut jobs and shrink the public sector. \"It's time to invest more in the public sector and get people into a position where they are able to spend more and put more money into the tax system.\" For more reaction from the protests click here. 'Depth of feeling' The marches come after industrial action by health workers on Monday - the first strike over pay in the NHS since the 1980s and the first time midwives had ever taken action. Hospital radiographers and prison officers will strike in the coming week as part of the same dispute. Cathy Warwick, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said the response from members showed the \"depth of feeling\" over the issue. A Treasury spokesman said the government had overseen the \"largest annual fall in unemployment, more people in work than ever before\" and average inequality levels \"lower than the average under the previous government\". He said it proved the government's \"long-term economic plan is working\". \"The only sustainable way to raise living standards is to keep working through the plan that is building a resilient economy and has enabled us to announce the first real terms increase in the minimum wage since the great recession. \"We appreciate that the effects of the great recession are still being felt, which is why we have taken continued action to help hard-working people by cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty, helping local authorities to freeze council tax, cutting energy bills, providing free school meals, and reducing childcare costs.\"", "summary": "英国伦敦、格拉斯哥和贝尔法斯特有数万人在星期六（10月18日）走上街头，抗议工资低和财政紧缩政策。"}

Representatives from 23 countries met in Rome on Tuesday to discuss the growing threat from IS in Libya. IS took control of Sirte, the hometown of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, last year. Disagreements between rival administrations in the country have hampered efforts to fight IS. The Islamist group is believed to have received support from some loyalists of the former regime. But Ismail Shukri, the head of intelligence in the city of Misrata, told Newsnight there had been an influx of foreign fighters in recent months. More about Islamic State in Libya: Control and crucifixions: Life in IS-controlled Sirte The school on the front line Guide to Libya's militias \"The majority [of IS fighters in Sirte] are foreigners, around 70%. Most of them are Tunisians, followed by Egyptians, Sudanese and a few Algerians. \"Add to that the Iraqis and the Syrians. Most of the Iraqis come from Saddam Hussein's disbanded army.\" Mr Shukri said senior IS commanders were taking refuge in Libya, under pressure from international airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. \"Some of their members, especially those with long-term importance to IS, are taking refuge here. They view Libya as a safe haven.\" Authorities in Misrata say they are preparing an offensive against Islamic State militants in Sirte. But in the town of Abugrein, 120km (75 miles) south of Misrata, the BBC saw little evidence of an imminent confrontation. Abugrein represents the final line of defence against IS. Beyond that, IS controls the road east. Commanders in Abugrein told Newsnight that their forces, loyal to the government in Tripoli, numbered around 1,400 - less than half the estimated strength of IS. Find out more Mohammed al-Bayoudi, a commander with Battalion 166, acknowledged that, without international help, they would not be able to defeat IS. \"Certainly we would welcome Nato support. But air strikes alone cannot defeat IS. What the army really needs is logistical support.\" The prospect of international military involvement in Libya is a vexed topic. The United States has acknowledged that it has sent in small numbers of special forces on at least one occasion in recent weeks. Similar groups from other Nato countries are also understood to be exploring potential local allies on the ground for a looming battle with IS. But fighters in Abugrein said they did not want to see Western boots on the ground. \"We Libyans will fight. There is no need for foreign troops,\" said Mr al-Bayoudi. Western governments, including the UK, are becoming increasingly concerned, and impatient. A proposed Italian-led training force, with up to 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries including the UK and France, has yet to be agreed. A major stumbling block is a lack of consensus from Libya's rival parliaments. A UN-brokered deal to create a unity government has stalled, amid opposition from both the Islamist-backed authorities in Tripoli and the internationally recognised government in Tobruk in the east.", "summary": "利比亚高级情报官员表示，几名“伊斯兰国”组织的高级指挥官最近几个月已从伊拉克和叙利亚前往利比亚。"}

His daughter, Crystal Dao Pepper, told the news conference in Chicago the family was \"sickened\" by what happened. Video of the incident has been watched by millions of people online. Law enforcement officials dragged Dr Dao off Sunday evening's Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, flight because it was fully booked, and the airline wanted four passengers to make way for staff members. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician had refused to leave, saying he needed to go home to see his patients. Lawyer Thomas Demetrio told journalists on Thursday: \"He [Dr Dao] said that he left Vietnam in 1975 when Saigon fell and he was on a boat and he said he was terrified. \"He said that being dragged down the aisle was more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam.\" Ms Dao Pepper, who lives in suburban Chicago, said: \"What happened to my dad should have never happened to any human being, regardless of the circumstance. \"We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what happened to him and to see what happened to him.\" Dr Dao's lawyers have filed an emergency court request for the airline to preserve evidence ahead of a hearing next Monday morning. The filing with an Illinois state court demands that United Airlines and the city of Chicago preserve all surveillance videos, cockpit voice recordings, passenger and crew lists related to the flight. United Airlines said it would refund the ticket costs of all passengers on Sunday's flight. Dr Dao was released on Wednesday night from a Chicago hospital, his lawyer said, adding that he planned to have reconstructive surgery. Mr Demetrio, and a second lawyer for Mr Dao, said that neither they nor the Dao family had heard from United Airlines yet. \"For a long time airlines, United in particular, have bullied us,\" Mr Demetrio told the press conference. \"We want respect and we want dignity, that's it! Not a big deal.\" The lawyer said he did not believe Mr Dao's race played a factor, despite an email he had received suggesting he was \"the modern day, Asian Rosa Parks\", a reference to the civil rights activist who refused to give up her seat on an Alabama bus in 1955. Mr Demetrio also said the family had not heard from United yet. But the airline said in a statement that its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, and the company had \"called Dr Dao on numerous occasions to express our heartfelt and deepest apologies\". The company did not comment on the potential litigation. On Wednesday, United's CEO said he felt \"shame and embarrassment\" and vowed it would never happen again. More than 150,000 people have signed online petitions calling for Mr Munoz to resign, but he has refused to do so. The CEO said Dr Dao had not been at fault, adding \"no one should be treated that way. Period.\" However, Mr Munoz initially described Dr Dao as \"disruptive and belligerent\". The airline has confirmed it is offering compensation to customers on United Flight 3411 for their flights. Three aviation security officers involved in removing Dr Dao from the plane have been \"placed on leave\", says the Chicago Department of Aviation. The US Department of Transportation is reviewing whether United complied with rules on booking.", "summary": "律师说，被美国联合航空拖下超售座位飞机的乘客陶成德（David Dao）说，他的经历比他在越南战争中的经历\"更可怕\"。"}

Poachers killed the animal at night, with a silencer, and then dehorned it. Stirton took the photo as part of an investigation into the illegal trade in rhino products. The photographer visited more than 30 such crime scenes in the course of his probe - experiences he said he found depressing. \"My first child is going to be born in February; I'm 48. And I think I left it such a long time because I kind of lost faith in a lot of the work we see as photojournalists. You lose faith in humanity to some extent.\" Stirton, who collected his award at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, believes this particular piece of butchery was probably carried out by local people, but working to order. The usual practice is to sell the animal's two horns to a middleman. This individual then smuggles the merchandise out of South Africa, most probably through Mozambique, to China or Vietnam. In those Asian countries rhino horn has a street value higher than gold or cocaine. The trade is driven by the misguided belief that horn - the same material as toenails - can cure everything from cancer to kidney stones. Brent Stirton told BBC News: \"For me to win this, for the jury to acknowledge this kind of picture - it's illustrative that we are living in a different time now, that this is a real issue. The sixth age of extinction is a reality and rhinos are just one of many species that we are losing at a hugely accelerated rate and I am grateful that the jury would choose this image because it gives this issue another platform.\" Lewis Blackwell, the chair of judges for WPY, said the rhino image had had a searing impact on his panel: \"People may be disgusted, they may be horrified - but it draws you in and you want to know more, you want to know the story behind it. And you can't escape it; it confronts you with what's going on in the world.\" The rather more peaceful image of a young western lowland gorilla feeding on breadfruit is the subject of the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year winning entry. This was taken by Daniël Nelson from the Netherlands, who entered the picture in the 15-17-years-old category. The gorilla is about nine years old and is called Caco by the trackers who took the young Dutchman to see the ape in Odzala National Park in the Republic of Congo. Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered. Their numbers are being denuded by illegal hunting for bushmeat, disease (notably the Ebola virus), and habitat loss (to mines and oil‑palm plantations). Daniël, who is now 18, said he first became aware of WPY when he was six. \"It inspired me immediately, and since then my passions in life have revolved around wildlife, photography and conservation.\" Some of the other WPY category winners This image is called Contemplation, taken by Peter Delaney (Ireland/South Africa). It wins the Animal Portraits category. It shows a resting chimpanzee on the forest floor in Uganda's Kibale National Park. Peter is from County Wicklow but WPY inspired him to move to Africa to pursue his photography career. Crab surprise is the title of this picture from Justin Gilligan (Australia). It claimed the Invertebrates category. It shows an octopus choosing a meal in a field of giant spider crabs in Mercury Passage off the east coast of Tasmania. Tony Wu (US) calls this The giant gathering. It is the Behaviour: Mammals winner. Tony is a specialist in photographing sperm whales. This huge gathering was captured off Sri Lanka's northeast coast. Very rarely have such scenes been witnessed by cameras. This unusual photo is titled The ice monster. Laurent Ballesta (France) captured the scene in waters off East Antarctica, close to the French Dumont d'Urville scientific base. It shows the underside of an iceberg. It's actually a mosaic of many images stitched together. It won the Earth's Environments category. Palm-oil survivors is the work of Bertie Gekoski (UK/USA) - the winner of the Wildlife Photojournalist: Single image award. It is taken in eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo. Three generations of Bornean elephants are seen moving across an oil-palm plantation being cleared for replanting. The palm oil industry has reduced and fragmented the animals' habitat. When the animals stray into plantations they often get shot or poisoned, says Bertie. The grip of the gulls, taken by Ekaterina Bee from Italy. Ekaterina is the winner in the 10 years and under category. She got these herring gulls to play for her camera by throwing some bread for them. Ekaterina is just five-and-a-half years old. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964 by what has since become BBC Wildlife Magazine, it has grown in scale and this year accepted 48,000 entries from 92 countries. The current competition is organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday.

US doctors took the unprecedented step to ensure the baby boy would be free of a genetic condition that his Jordanian mother carries in her genes. Experts say the move heralds a new era in medicine and could help other families with rare genetic conditions. But they warn that rigorous checks of this new and controversial technology, called mitochondrial donation, are needed. It's not the first time scientists have created babies that have DNA from three people - that breakthrough began in the late 1990s - but it is an entirely new and significant method. Three person babies Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into usable energy. Some women carry genetic defects in mitochondria and they can pass these on to their children. In the case of the Jordanian family, it was a disorder called Leigh Syndrome that would have proved fatal to any baby conceived. The family had already experienced the heartache of four miscarriages as well as the death of two children - one at eight months and the other at six years of age. Leigh syndrome Scientists have devised a number of fertility methods to help such families. The US team, who travelled to Mexico to carry out the procedure because there are no laws there that prohibit it, used a method that takes all the vital DNA from the mother's egg plus healthy mitochondria from a donor egg to create a healthy new egg that can be fertilised with the father's sperm. The result is a baby with 0.1% of their DNA from the donor (mitochondrial DNA) and all the genetic code for things like hair and eye colour from the mother and father. Dr John Zhang, medical director at the New Hope Fertility Centre in New York City, and his colleagues used the method to make five embryos - only one of them developed normally. The UK has already passed laws to allow the creation of babies from three people. But the science does raise ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Fertility experts say it is important to push ahead, but cautiously. Some have questioned whether we are only now hearing the success story while failed attempts could have gone unreported. Prof Alison Murdoch, part of the team at Newcastle University that has been at the forefront of three person IVF work in the UK, said: \"The translation of mitochondrial donation to a clinical procedure is not a race but a goal to be achieved with caution to ensure both safety and reproducibility.\" Critics say the work is irresponsible. Dr David King from the pro-choice group Human Genetics Alert, said: \"It is outrageous that they simply ignored the cautious approach of US regulators and went to Mexico, because they think they know better. Since when is a simplistic \"to save lives is the ethical thing to do\" a balanced medical ethics approach, especially when no lives were being saved?\" Dr Zhang and his team say they will answer these questions when they presents their findings at a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. Prof Darren Griffin, an expert in Genetics at the University of Kent, said: \"This study heralds a new era in preimplantation genetics and represents a novel means for the treatment of families at risk of transmitting genetic disease. \"With radical new treatments like this there are always challenging ethical issues, however any concerns need to be balanced against the ramifications of not implementing such a technology when families are in need of it.\" The structure of a cell Nucleus: Where the majority of our DNA is held - this determines how we look and our personality Mitochondria: Often described as the cell's factories, these create the energy to make the cell function Cytoplasm: The jelly like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria Follow Michelle on Twitter", "summary": "英国《新科学家》（New Scientist）周刊宣布，采用一种新的“3人共同生育”技术的首名婴儿已经诞生。"}

She also said that thousands of doctors would be drafted in from overseas to improve the national health service. Earlier she held an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the protests. The demonstrations began over transport fare rises in Sao Paulo, but quickly grew into rallies across the country against corruption and other issues. On Thursday night more than a million people took to the streets and there was violence in various cities in which dozens were injured and two people died. Protests continued on Friday with an estimated 1,000 people marching in Rio de Janeiro. Witnesses said some stores were looted and an empty arts centre building was invaded. Police were pelted with rocks and responded with tear gas. Demonstrations also took place in Sao Paulo, where traffic was brought to a halt but no violence was reported, and in Fortaleza in Brazil's north-east. In her address - pre-recorded and broadcast nationally on TV and radio - Mrs Rousseff said she was listening to the demonstrators' concerns. She promised to meet the leaders of the peaceful protests saying she needed \"their contribution, their energy and their ability\". Football anger The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says President Rousseff struck a conciliatory note for the most challenging speech she has had to make as Brazil's leader. \"I want institutions that are more transparent, more resistant to wrongdoing,\" she said. She also defended hosting next year's football World Cup saying Brazil had always been welcomed in international events. \"We will treat our guests with respect and make a great World Cup,\" she said. Answering criticism of the cost of hosting the event, she said the World Cup would be financed by companies that are making use of the sporting arenas. \"I would never allow this money to come out of the taxpayers' money, harming essential areas such as health and education,\" she said. Some of the protests have targeted the Confederations Cup, the eight-team tournament currently taking place which is considered a dry run for next year's World Cup. Demonstrators have expressed their anger at steep ticket prices and the money spent on both tournaments, as well as the 2016 Olympic Games, which Rio de Janeiro is hosting.

Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to scatter the crowds. Belo Horizonte Police and protesters clashed in the eastern city of Belo Horizonte, which hosted a game in the Confederations Cup - the warm-up tournament for the World Cup. Sao Paulo The widespread demonstrations taking place across the country followed a police crackdown on smaller protests in Sao Paulo, which galvanized Brazilians to take to the streets. The city saw thousands gather once again near the city's landmark Avenida Paulista late on Thursday. Fortaleza At least 30,000 people rallied in the north-eastern city of Fortaleza ahead of the Confederations Cup game with Mexico this week.

The biggest drop was in England, where applications are down 10%. This means that about 50,000 fewer people are applying to university compared with the previous year. Universities Minister David Willetts said the application figures were \"the second highest on record\" - and that tens of thousands more people were still expected to apply. \"This will still be a competitive year like any other as people continue to understand that university remains a good long term investment for their future,\" said Mr Willetts. Deterring applications? Labour's universities spokeswoman, Shabana Mahmood, said \"the decision of the Tory-led government to treble tuition fees to £9,000 is hitting young people and their aspirations\". These updated figures from the Ucas admissions service show the level of applications up to the end of June. While England has seen the most substantial reduction, down 10% compared with the same point last year, there are also declines of 2% in Scotland, 3% in Wales and 5% in Northern Ireland. Universities in England are going to charge up to £9,000 per year from this year - while Scottish students at Scottish universities will not face any tuition fees. The biggest fall for the 2012 intake is among the over-18 age group - for example, applications from 19 year olds and those aged between 25 and 29 are down by 12%. Among 18-year-old school leavers, the fall has been less marked, approaching 3%. The raising of tuition fees had been criticised as a deterrent to poorer students - but the latest figures show a mixed picture. The biggest reduction in England is among students from the 20% most advantaged areas - although whether this means they are not going to university, or studying outside the UK, is not certain. Applications from the most disadvantaged areas fell marginally. Wealth gap But the rate of applications remain strongly tied to family income. The 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas are many times more likely to apply to university than their counterparts in the poorest - with all the income bands in between following this same stratification. This social divide has remained in place throughout the decade - and appears to be continuing through this latest fee increase. There have also been questions about how the growing differences in fees between countries within the UK will affect cross-border applications. The latest figures show fewer English students applying to Scottish universities and fewer Scottish students applying to England - from an already low base. Northern Ireland has had the highest proportion of students going elsewhere in the UK - but this round of applications shows a fall of 14% for applications to English universities and 15% down for Scotland. Wales bucks this trend - with more applications to England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Temporary fall? This year will see the first fall since 2006 - when a previous increase in tuition fees pushed down applications. That proved a temporary drop - with numbers recovering the following year. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"These figures confirm that the fall in applications is far less dramatic than some were predicting for this year.\" Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, attacked \"the folly of hiking up tuition fees to £9,000\". \"This government can talk all it likes about improving social mobility but how will erecting punitive financial barriers help our best and brightest get on?\" Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the Million+ group of new universities, challenged the idea that the fee system should be assessed on the basis of applications from 18 year olds going into full-time degrees. \"They now make up less than half of the student cohort and it is premature to reach any conclusions about the impact of higher fees on the background of students. This will only be known much later,\" said Ms Tatlow.", "summary": "最新数据显示，今年秋季入学的大学申请人数比去年减少了5万人，跌幅8.9%。"}

Millions of people from the Allied countries took part in parades and street parties. Germany had surrendered on 7 May 1945, followed by Victory in Europe (VE) Day on 8 May, but World War Two still continued in the Asia-Pacific region. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said then: \"We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, but let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead.\" An estimated 71,000 soldiers from Britain and the Commonwealth were killed in the war against Japan, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war who died in Japanese captivity. Japan treated prisoners of war very badly, including American and British soldiers who had surrendered. Following the end of the fighting in Europe, the Allies told Japan to surrender by 28 July 1945, but the deadline passed without them doing so. It wasn't until the US had dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August, that Japan surrendered and ended the war. The recorded death tolls of the atomic bombings are estimates, but it is thought that about 140,000 of Hiroshima's 350,000 population were killed in the blast, and at least 74,000 people died in Nagasaki. After days of rumours, US President Harry S Truman broke the news of Japan's surrender at a press conference on 14 August. In an address to a crowd that had gathered outside the White House, President Truman said: \"This is the day we have been waiting for since Pearl Harbor. This is the day when fascism finally dies, as we always knew it would.\" British Prime Minister Clement Atlee said: \"The last of our enemies is laid low.\" He expressed gratitude to Britain's allies, the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand, India, Burma, all countries occupied by Japan, and the USSR. He added that special thanks went to the US \"without whose prodigious efforts the war in the East would still have many years to run\". The following day, Japan's Emperor Hirohito was heard on the radio for the first time ever in a broadcast in which he blamed the use of \"a new and most cruel bomb\" for Japan's unconditional surrender. He added: \"Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in the ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but would lead also to the total extinction of human civilisation.\" In London, the Royal Family greeted cheering crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Thousands watched King George VI and the Queen driven down the Mall in an open carriage. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret later mingled with the crowds outside the palace. That evening, the King addressed the nation and the Empire in a broadcast from his study at Buckingham Palace. He said: \"Our hearts are full to overflowing, as are your own. \"Yet there is not one of us who has experienced this terrible war who does not realise that we shall feel its inevitable consequences long after we have all forgotten our rejoicings today.\" The official surrender documents were signed by Japan on 2 September aboard the USS Missouri battleship in Tokyo Bay.

In the letter to Germany's economics minister dated last Friday, Mr Grenell said secure communications systems are essential for defence and intelligence co-operation, and that firms like Huawei could compromise this. The warning marks an escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to convince allies to boycott the Chinese tech giant. The US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. Huawei has launched a more aggressive strategy in recent months to counter what it sees as an American \"smear\" campaign. Last week, it filed a lawsuit against the US government over a ban that restricts federal agencies from using its products, arguing it is \"unconstitutional.\" Huawei has also taken out ads in the foreign press and invited foreign journalists to visit its campuses.

The couple, married in 1999 aboard a private yacht in New York, have two daughters together, Grace and Chloe. In 2011, Ms Deng famously leapt to her husband's defence to slap a protester who threw a pie at him as British MPs quizzed him over phone-hacking. Mr Murdoch, 82, met his Chinese-born third wife in 1997 at a cocktail party in Hong Kong. They were married two years later, weeks after his second divorce. Pre-nup Ms Deng, 44, is 38 years younger than the Australian-born media mogul, who is said by Forbes to be worth $9.4bn (£6bn). \"I can confirm for the record that Rupert filed in New York State Supreme Court this morning for divorce,\" Murdoch spokesman Steven Rubenstein told AFP news agency on Thursday. The BBC's Robert Peston says the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement and have held shares in trust for their children. So our business editor believes the divorce is not likely to lessen the magnate's grip on his media empire. Mr Murdoch, now a US citizen, reportedly paid $1.7bn in his divorce settlement from his last wife. Ms Deng, said to be the daughter of a factory director, was born in 1968 and grew up in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou before leaving for the US at 19 to study. She worked in a Chinese restaurant in California before going on to graduate from Yale University in 1996. Ms Deng was later employed by Star TV, News Corp's Asian satellite-television operation in Hong Kong, where she met Mr Murdoch during one of his visits. The divorce filing comes two days before News Corp is to be split into two companies, one for its entertainment assets and the other for its publishing business. Mr Murdoch is to be chairman of both firms. His global media portfolio includes the Wall Street Journal, television channels such as Fox News and Sky, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. Two years ago, his UK newspaper division became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal, which led Mr Murdoch to close one of the titles, the News of the World. In July 2011, Ms Deng jumped from her seat during a UK parliamentary hearing to slap a prankster who tried to shove a shaving-cream pie into Mr Murdoch's face.", "summary": "新闻集团证实，该集团主席兼首席执行官默多克向法院提出和妻子邓文迪离婚。"}

This move will turn concern into alarm and anger. Beijing sees Taiwan as a province. Denying it any of the trappings of an independent state is one of the key priorities of Chinese foreign policy. For four decades American leaders have respected Beijing's red lines on closing down diplomatic space for Taiwan and acknowledging that there is only \"One China\". The phone call between Mr Trump and Ms Tsai is the first known contact between a US president or president-elect and a Taiwanese leader since the United States broke diplomatic relations with the island in 1979. Taiwan does not have a formal mutual defence treaty with the US, and American commitments on the defence of the island are deliberately shrouded in ambiguity. But as China's military might grows, the island of Taiwan relies ultimately on the American security umbrella in East Asia for protection from invasion. This is already a sensitive time in the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan. Under President Xi Jinping, China has been putting growing economic and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to move towards reunification. But despite Beijing's efforts, the party it favours lost elections across the board over the past year. Opinion polls suggest that younger Taiwanese may be becoming more, not less, resistant to reunification with the mainland. Both before and after her election to the presidency in January, Ms Tsai promised to maintain the status quo in the cross-straits relationship, but Beijing does not trust her and has broken off official contacts with her administration. 'Enough to infuriate Beijing' In this context, any shift in the relationship between Taiwan and the US is significant. In a statement released after the phone call, the president-elect's office said the two leaders noted that \"close economic, political, and security ties\" exist between Taiwan and the United States. It also said Mr Trump \"congratulated President Tsai on becoming president of Taiwan\". This content may seem uncontroversial on the face of it, but the very fact of the call and of an American president-elect congratulating a Taiwanese president will be quite enough to infuriate Beijing. A spokesman for the US National Security Council said afterwards that government policy had not changed but Mr Trump's team did not inform the White House before the call. When Donald Trump was asked during his campaign to name the person he consulted most often on foreign policy, he said: \"I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.\" Mr Trump has said a lot of things… about \"winning\" against China on trade, about whether US allies like Japan and South Korea should pay more for their own defence, about quitting the regional TPP trade deal that was a centrepiece of his predecessor's policy in Asia. Like many other governments, Beijing is puzzling over which of these things to take seriously. But there are few things more serious for China than the status of Taiwan. When it has worked out how to understand the significance of the phone call between Mr Trump and Ms Tsai, expect Beijing to \"say a lot of things\" in return.", "summary": "美国总统当选人决定背弃美国近四十年的对台礼节，直接与台湾总统进行电话通话，此举将令北京的政策制定者们惊讶。"}

It also explains the site's lingering association with UFOs and aliens. The remote patch of desert surrounding Groom Lake was chosen because it was adjacent to a nuclear testing facility. \"The U-2 was absolutely top secret,\" Chris Pocock, a British defence journalist and author of histories of the programme, told the BBC. \"They had to hide everything about it.\" The U-2 plane, developed to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, is still flown by the US Air Force. Reports of UFOs The document, a secret 1992 internal CIA history of the U-2 programme, was originally declassified in 1998 with heavy redactions. Many of the blacked-out details were revealed this month after a public records request by the National Security Archive at the George Washington University in Washington DC. The site was selected for the U-2 programme in 1955 after an aerial survey by CIA and Air Force staff. According to the history, President Dwight Eisenhower personally signed off on the acquisition. Officials from the CIA, Air Force and Lockheed, the contractor building the U-2, began moving into the facility in July 1955. While a lengthy account of the development of the U-2 spy plane programme, the history also attempts to shed light on the public's fascination with the Area 51 site and its lingering associations with extra-terrestrials and UFOs. It notes that testing of the U-2 plane in the 1950s - at altitudes much higher than commercial aeroplanes then flew - provoked \"a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)\". \"At this time, no one believed manned flight was possible above 60,000 feet, so no one expected to see an object so high in the sky,\" note authors Gregory Pedlow and Donald Welzenbach. 'Inclination towards secrecy' The original request for the redacted portions of the history was made in 2005. It was released to the National Security Archive several weeks ago. Jeff Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, said the long period of secrecy was notable because of the extent people across the world were already aware of Area 51's existence. Mr Richelson speculates the CIA must have recently made a conscious, deliberate decision to reveal Area 51's existence and origins. \"There is a general inclination towards secrecy,\" he said, and the many US agencies and non-US governments involved in the U-2 programme would have had a say in the declassification process. \"As far as I can tell, this is the first time something must have gone to a high-enough level to discuss whether or not to formally acknowledge Area 51's existence,\" he said", "summary": "美国中央情报局在新解密的有关U-2侦察机文件中正式承认在内华达州沙漠中一处秘密试验基地的存在。"}

Dr Kent Brantly was flown home for treatment on Saturday. His colleague Nancy Writebol arrived back in the city of Atlanta on Tuesday. Since February, 887 people have died of Ebola in four West African countries. US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Tuesday that the risk of Ebola transmission in the US is \"very low\". \"We have in this country the protocols to isolate and manage any patient who may present with those symptoms of the disease,\" she said. Meanwhile, another man is being tested for Ebola at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York after travelling to West Africa. The hospital said he was in isolation and \"was stable overnight and in good spirits\". The World Bank is allocating $200m (£120m) in emergency assistance for countries battling to contain the Ebola outbreak. It is the world's deadliest outbreak to date and has centred on Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been two cases in the Nigerian city of Lagos, where eight people are currently in quarantine. British Airways has temporarily suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until 31 August 2014 because of the health crisis, the airline said in a statement. It follows a similar suspension by two regional air carriers last week. The virus spreads by contact with infected blood and bodily fluids. The current outbreak is killing between 50% and 60% of people infected. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola - but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says clinical trials are to start in September on an Ebola vaccine that has shown promising results during tests on animals. \"By the middle to end of 2015, we'll be able to have some vaccine - at least to vaccinate health workers - who put themselves at considerable risk when they take care of these patients,\" he told the BBC's Newsday programme. The US aid workers were treated with the ZMapp serum before their evacuation from Liberia. According to a CNN report, quoting a doctor in Liberia, Dr Brantly's condition improved dramatically within an hour of receiving the drug. Service in Mission (SIM), the Christian aid group that employs Ms Writebol, says she has had two doses of the drug and did not respond as well as Dr Brantly but she is showing \"improvement\". \"She is walking with assistance... strength is better... has an appetite,\" SIM spokesman Palmer Holt told the Washington Post newspaper in an email on Monday. Ms Writebol is in a special isolation ward at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, where Dr Brantly is being treated by infectious disease specialists. Three companies, the US government and the Public Health Agency of Canada are behind the experimental drug. \"ZMapp was first identified as a drug candidate in January 2014 and has not yet been evaluated for safety in humans. As such, very little of the drug is currently available,\" Mapp Biopharmaceutical said in a statement. \"Mapp and its partners are co-operating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.\" Ebola has initial flu-like symptoms that can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums, and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure. In another development, the World Health Organization is to hold an emergency meeting in Geneva starting on Wednesday to discuss new measures to tackle the Ebola outbreak. The meeting will decide whether to declare a global health emergency which could involve imposing travel restrictions on affected countries.

Downing Street said there were \"no plans\" to detain him after his arrival. Mr Aamer said he felt \"obliged\" to everyone who fought for him to be released, and to \"bring an end to Guantanamo\". \"My thanks go to Allah first, second to my wife, my family, to my kids and then to my lawyers who did everything they could to carry the word to the world,\" he said. \"I am overwhelmed by what people have done by their actions, their thoughts and their prayers, and without their devotion to justice I would not be here in Britain now.\" Concern has been raised over the health of the Saudi national, 48, whose family live in London, and the BBC witnessed an ambulance arrive at the airport. Number 10 said Prime Minister David Cameron \"welcomes\" the release of Mr Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is British. It also said any necessary security measures \"will be put in place\". The father-of-four landed at London's Biggin Hill Airport shortly before 13:00 GMT. Mr Aamer's father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, said his release was a \"miracle\". \"It's a delightful day,\" he told BBC News while admitting it was also a \"surprise\". Mr Aamer, who was first held by US authorities in Afghanistan in 2001, maintains he was in the country doing charity work. Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents George W Bush and then Barack Obama. It is understood Mr Aamer will go through standard immigration checks now he has arrived in the UK. Mr Aamer's legal representative Clive Stafford Smith told BBC News: \"Shaker only wants the truth to come out he is not interested in persecuting anyone. \"His first priority is health - he really is in terrible shape.\" In letters sent to the BBC by his lawyers earlier this month, Mr Aamer described himself as \"an old car that has not been to the garage for years\", saying the first thing he wanted once freed was a cup of coffee. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent When the business jet carrying Shaker Aamer landed in London he was met by British officials. His lawyers say he will need urgent medical and mental assessments. He may, like others who have been held at Guantanamo, be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. While the PM has said Mr Aamer won't be detained, it's unlikely we will ever find out if MI5 separately decides to monitor him - by definition its work is secret. Mr Aamer is said to be relaxed about such prospects and has asked his lawyers to make clear he believes he has a \"contract\" to honour with the people of Britain. Shaker Aamer's return is the end of an astonishing and murky personal saga. But it's by no means the end of the story. The government's long-promised investigation into substantial allegations that our agencies became mixed up in rendition and torture - unwittingly or otherwise - hasn't happened. Shaker Aamer and many others want to know the truth. Who is Shaker Aamer? What now for Guantanamo detainee? Shaker Aamer in his own words 'Falsely imprisoned' Mr Aamer's release has been welcomed by some human rights groups and a number of MPs - but others say serious questions remain unanswered. Amnesty International said Mr Aamer's alleged torture in front of British agents in Afghanistan was a very serious claim that required investigation. Tory MP David Davis said he was keen to speak to Mr Aamer, saying: \"When Mr Aamer is ready to talk, the Shaker Aamer All-Party Parliamentary Group, and I am sure many more MPs, look forward to seeing what he has to say about his detention.\" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Shaker was simply a man in the wrong place at the wrong time, a charity worker building wells in Afghanistan who was kidnapped, ransomed and falsely imprisoned.\" But Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society - a think tank which supports liberal democracies and an interventionist approach to foreign affairs - said: \"Any joy and relief at his release must be tempered by the fact that this is someone who has had very serious questions posed of his past connections and conduct.\" Lawyer and journalist Jonathan Foreman told the BBC Mr Aamer's lack of a trial was \"not so incredible\" because he was \"not detained in the same way as a criminal trial, he was detained on the battlefield as an unlawful combatant\". 'Approved for transfer' Mr Aamer was detained in Afghanistan by bounty hunters tracking down and handing over possible al-Qaeda suspects, shortly after the 9/11 attacks in the US. He was detained on the same day his youngest son was born, and has never seen him. Mr Aamer was first held by US forces at Bagram air base, near Kabul, where his lawyers say he was tortured. They say he made false confessions to end his torture. In February 2002, Mr Aamer was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where his lawyers say he suffered further abuse. The US Department of Defense said on Friday a review had been conducted of Mr Aamer's case. \"As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, Aamer was unanimously approved for transfer.\" the statement said. Some 112 people are still being held at Guantanamo, which President Obama has promised to close, the statement confirmed. Guantanamo Bay is a US military prison in Cuba, set up during the \"war on terror\" in 2002 to detain what the US government called \"enemy combatants\". The first 20 detainees were transferred to the facility on 11 January of that year, and a total of 780 men have been held since then - the vast majority without charge or criminal trial.", "summary": "被美军囚禁于关塔那摩基地长达13年的最后一名英国居民早间获释。"}

Critics have hit out at the use of the hull of the ship, in which hundreds of migrants drowned, at the Venice Biennale. The fishing vessel sank on its trip from Libya to Italy in 2015 and at least 700 people, many from Africa, died as a result. Swiss-Icelandic artist Christoph Büchel brought the boat to the Biennale which opened to the public at the weekend. He said that his exhibit, Barca Nostra (Our Boat), was intended to be \"a monument to contemporary migration\". It was the Mediterranean's deadliest shipwreck in living memory and happened in the middle of the European migrant crisis, which peaked in 2016 with an estimated 5,096 people dying or going missing trying to cross the Mediterranean - the highest number ever recorded. Some art critics have been scathing in their attacks on Büchel's use of the ship. In the Guardian, Adrian Searle calls it a vulgar gesture. \"I found Büchel's appropriation of the boat in which so many migrants lost their lives a vile and mawkish spectacle in the context of the Biennale. \"The best one can say of Büchel's intervention is that it brings us face to face with death. Biennale visitors pause to take selfies in front of it.\" How people interact with the boat has appeared to alarm observers. A tweet showing a cafe next to the boat is described as \"peak art world\" by Martin Herbert. Matthew Mpoke Bigg from the UN refugee agency points out that people were \"sipping aperitifs at a nearby cafe in the sunshine, some apparently ignorant of the horror of what happened there\". Calling it the \"most troubling\" exhibit at the Biennale, Cristina Ruiz in the Art Newspaper gives an explanation why art lovers may not be acting in the sombre way some might expect. \"Art can and should deal with the most pressing issues of our time and Büchel's boat would easily be the most important inclusion in [the] Biennale if it were not for the fact that Büchel has chosen to provide no labels or signs near the rusting vessel. \"It is true that there is information about the boat and its history in the Biennale catalogue but only a small proportion of visitors purchase this. \"So many, if not most, exhibition goers will eat and drink in the shadow of this ship with absolutely no idea of the tragedy that unfolded there.\" Who died in the 18 April 2015 shipwreck? Context is everything, it seems for these critics. One detail of context to be considered is the motivation of the curator of the Venice Biennale, explains BBC arts editor Will Gompertz. He points out that curator Ralph Rugoff had already said art should be \"entertaining\". But the critics went further, starting to question the purpose of art in our society at this point. \"Horrified\" by the exhibit, Stephen Pritchard wrote in his blog Colouring in Culture that the artist was exploiting the tragedy: \"To see the art world fawn over a shipwreck that was a grave to so many people is utterly abhorrent. \"To exhibit it as a 'relic' or 'monument' such a tragic loss of life is to reify, commodify and totally exploit the lives of not only those who lost their lives but migration itself.\" 'Barbarous exhibit' While Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says in the I newspaper that the exhibit is reflective of a worrying trend in the art world - an exhibit that \"lacks integrity\". \"Büchel simply used the dispossessed on the high seas to flaunt his artistic and political nihilism\". For her, it was not the people taking selfies and having picnics next to the tragic artefact that stood out. Instead, it was what was not there that led her to conclude the exhibit was \"barbarous\": \"The dead souls are not there, not even as black silhouettes. They are, one surmises, unimportant to the 'provocative' Swiss-Icelandic artist, Christopher Büchel\". Büchel himself declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Instead he said everything he wanted to say was in the original press release. In this he argues that Barca Nostra is \"a relic of a human tragedy but also a monument to contemporary migration\". \"The vessel has become a symbolic object, dedicated not only to the victims of the tragic event in 2015 and the people involved in its recovery, but to our mutual responsibility representing the collective policies and politics that create such wrecks.\"", "summary": "如果说艺术的目的是为了引起人们的强烈反应，那么在世界最大型艺术展上展出的一艘失事船只就做到了这一点。"}

The two species lived around the same time, but Paranthropus robustus died out earlier. The research team described the find as exciting. \"Most of the fossil record is just a single tooth here and there so to have something like this is very rare, very lucky,\" Dr Angeline Leece told the BBC. The researchers, from Melbourne's La Trobe University, found the skull's fragments in 2018 at the Drimolen archaeological site north of Johannesburg. It was uncovered just metres away from a spot where a similarly aged Homo erectus skull of a child was discovered in 2015. Archaeologists then spent the past few years piecing together and analysing the fossil. Their findings were published in the Nature, Ecology and Evolution journal on Tuesday. Co-researcher Jesse Martin told the BBC that handling the fossil pieces was like working with \"wet cardboard\", adding he had used plastic straws to suck the last traces of dirt off them. 'Competing species' It is thought that three hominins (human-like creatures) species lived in South Africa at the same time in competition with each other. As such the skull discovery presented a rare example of \"microevolution\" within human lineage, Mr Martin said. Paranthropus robustus had large teeth and small brains, differing from Homo erectus which had large brains and small teeth. It is believed the former's diet involved eating mainly tough plants, like tubers and bark. \"Through time, Paranthropus robustus likely evolved to generate and withstand higher forces produced during biting and chewing food that was hard or mechanically challenging to process with their jaws and teeth,\" said Dr Leece. The scientists said it was possible that a wetter environment caused by climate change may have reduced the food available to them. Meanwhile Homo erectus, with their smaller teeth, was more likely to have eaten both plants and meat. \"These two vastly different species... represent divergent evolutionary experiments,\" Dr Leece said. \"While we were the lineage that won out in the end, two million years ago the fossil record suggests that Paranthropus robustus was much more common than Homo erectus on the landscape.\"", "summary": "澳大利亚研究人员称，在南非发现的一个200万年前的头骨为人类进化提供了更多信息。"}

The packages were addressed to former President Obama, ex-Secretary Clinton and former CIA Director John Brennan. Additional suspicious packages addressed to Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and former Attorney General Eric Holder are currently being investigated by law enforcement. The packages to Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton were intended to arrive at their residences. FBI Special Agent Bryan Paarman told reporters the device for Mr Brennan, which appeared to be live, had been sent to CNN's mailroom. One of the packages sent had listed Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender. The package intended for Mr Holder was sent to an incorrect address and returned to the congresswoman's office in Sunrise, Florida, US media say. Mr Brennan was scheduled to appear on CNN on Wednesday, US media report. Mr Brennan, is a frequent contributor to the network and has become a vocal critic of Mr Trump since leaving office. According to a statement from the US Secret Service, the package addressed to Mrs Clinton was recovered late on 23 October. \"Early this morning, October 24, 2018, a second package addressed to the residence of Former President Barack Obama was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington, DC,\" the statement adds. \"Both packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location. The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them.\" These attempted attacks come two days after a confirmed pipe bomb was discovered in a mailbox at the home of Mr Soros, who has been criticised by right-wing groups for supporting liberal causes. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had said a suspicious package had been sent to his office, but New York police told the BBC \"it was a thumb drive and is not related to other events\". What was in the packages? The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. Law enforcement officials tell US media that the device discovered at CNN on Wednesday appears to be similar to the one found at Mr Soros' home on Monday. Police commissioner Mr O'Neill also said law enforcement found an \"envelope containing white powder\" in the packaging of the device sent to CNN. The powder is being investigated, but authorities found \"no additional threats\" after sweeping the area. A US official told the Associated Press that a \"functional explosive device\" was found during a screening of mail sent to the home of Mr and Mrs Clinton in Chappaqua, New York. Speaking at a campaign event in Florida, Mrs Clinton thanked the Secret Service and said she and her family \"are fine\". \"It is a troubling time,\" she said. \"It is a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together. We also have to elect candidates who will try to do the same.\" A spokeswoman for Mr Obama declined to comment on the incident, and referred reporters to the Secret Service statement. In a statement, Ms Waters thanked law enforcement and said she \"unequivocally condemn[s] any and all acts of violence and terror\". What's the reaction? White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders condemned the \"attempted violent attacks\" against the public figures. In a follow-up tweet, she added that the White House condemnation \"certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants\". But CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker criticised the president and Mrs Sanders in a statement on Wednesday afternoon. \"There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,\" he said. \"The president, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far they have shown no comprehension of that.\" The president has repeatedly called journalists the \"enemy of the people\". In a joint statement, top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer also said the president's words \"ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence\". The US President's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, who received a suspicious package at his New York home earlier this year, tweeted: \"As someone whose family has directly been the victim of these mail threats I condemn whoever did this regardless of party or ideology.\" His sister, Ivanka Trump, also condemned the \"acts of violence\", while First Lady Melania Trump called them \"cowardly\", adding \"I strongly condemn all that choose violence\". Chelsea Clinton, the only child of Bill and Hillary Clinton, tweeted: \"Every day, I am grateful to the women and men of the United States Secret Service. Thank you.\"", "summary": "一系列怀疑藏有爆炸品的包裹在同一天分别寄至美国政界多名显赫人物的办公室或寓所，包括前总统奥巴马（Barack Obama）以及前国务卿希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）。"}

But children who used consoles for more than three hours reported lower satisfaction with their lives overall. The research is published in the journal Pediatrics. Experimental psychologist Dr Andrew Przybylski analysed British surveys involving 5,000 young people aged 10 to 15 years old. Social interactions Some 75% of those questioned said they played video games daily. Children were asked to quantify how much time they spent gaming on a typical school day - using consoles or computers. They then rated a number of factors, including: The answers were combined to assess levels of psychological and social adjustment. When compared with all other groups, including those who played no video games at all, young people reporting under an hour of play each day were most likely to say they were satisfied with their lives and showed the highest levels of positive social interactions. The group also had fewer problems with emotional issues and lower levels of hyperactivity. According to the results, people who spent more than three hours playing games were the least well adjusted. 'Digital world' Dr Przybylski says there may be numerous reasons behind this. He told the BBC: \"In a research environment that is often polarised between those who believe games have an extremely beneficial role and those who link them to violent acts, this research could provide a new, more nuanced standpoint. \"Being engaged in video games may give children a common language. \"And for someone who is not part of this conversation, this might end up cutting the young person off.\" He argues that policies and guidelines that impose limits on the use of this technology need to take such evidence into account. Dr Przybylski points out that though the effect of video games on children is statistically significant in this study, factors such as the strength of family relationships play a larger role. Dr Iroise Dumontheil, of Birkbeck, University of London, who was not involved in the research, said: \"Other studies have shown that playing first-person shooter games, but not other types, can lead to increased visuospatial processing and memory abilities. \"Further research would help to determine whether particular types of game help or hinder adolescents as they adjust to the changes they experience during development.\"", "summary": "牛津大学的一项研究显示，每天玩一会儿电脑游戏可能会对少年儿童的心理发育有好处。"}

Before the auction, Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as an \"an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property\".

Autumn had just had a bath when she first spoke about these feelings. She wanted two towels, one for the hair and one for the body, \"like a woman\". \"She then came out of the bathroom with her two towels, saying: 'I've got something to tell you Mum, I'm not Anthony, I'm not a boy, I'm a girl',\" says Fran Norris. \"At the time, I think I was lost for words as for what to say. I just gave her a hug. \"I had trouble sleeping that night, I had that many things going on in my head, of what to do from there.\" Ms Norris, from Shifnal in Shropshire, believes it had been on Autumn's mind for a long time and she had engaged in \"feminine role-play\" to explore her identity. She would often come to her and ask to wear her clothes, put on make-up, do her nails or wear hair extensions. Initially, Autumn had two weeks, during the Easter break, where she dressed as a girl. \"It was taking things one day at a time, letting her lead the way and discover, in herself, who she was,\" Ms Norris says. \"After those two weeks she was going to school as Anthony, and changing and becoming Autumn at home.\" Eventually, they informed Autumn's school. Ms Norris says it has been \"incredibly supportive\", and, although the children have had \"mixed reactions\", teachers have tackled the issue \"head on\". \"They will say things like, 'Do you remember Anthony? Do you remember how upset he could get, and how angry he could be? Don't you think Autumn is happier?', and explaining Autumn is who she wants to be,\" Ms Norris says. Ms Norris says they didn't approach their GP until later, when Autumn was referred to the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. The London-based trust sees many UK children who are questioning their gender, through its gender identity development service. It received 2,519 referrals in 2017-18 for under 18s. The majority, 1,806, were assigned female at birth, and there were 13 referrals of children aged five. \"Her appointments are just purely her talking through who she is, who she feels that she is inside, how she identifies herself,\" says Ms Norris. \"Tavistock and Portman haven't gone too in-depth with Autumn about future processes and changes. They have talked about the use of hormone blockers, but that's years into Autumn's future if she is still living as a girl.\" Autumn says the sessions with the service are something she enjoys. \"It is very exciting, because I get to talk about what I am going through and how I am feeling,\" she says. Ms Norris says she plans to write a book about their \"emotional journey\", to clear up \"misinformation\" about the process and how it affects children and their families. \"I wanted to get something out there to actually go through the process a bit more in depth and make people aware how it affects a whole family,\" she explains. Children and gender dysphoria Ms Norris has also been in contact with the secondary school she hopes Autumn will attend, which already has a transgender student. She has spoken to that child's mother and says the school has been \"very accommodating and has an LGBTQ after-school group\". \"When she told us this is what she wanted to happen, and wanted to spend some time dressed as a female, at first we saw it as her wanting to experiment. \"It was only when she started to do that it became clear that it was the right path for her; whether it remains the right path in future remains to be seen. \"If she wasn't given the freedom to choose her identity, it would create problems further down the line. \"But nothing is set in stone, because there has not been any physical intervention, no procedures to change her physicality - it is all cosmetic, in the way she dresses and has her hair.\" She adds: \"At this moment in time, Autumn is very settled into living as a female and, when she talks about the future and her dreams, it's about being a mother and getting married to the man of her dreams. \"I can't say 100% whether I think Autumn will remain female past puberty; there could be a change when hormones kick in. \"But at this moment in time I have a daughter that I'm proud of and will do everything I can to support and help make her wishes come true. \"I just hope she will always feel she can express herself.\" If you have been affected by any of the issues raised, support and advice is available via BBC Action Line.

Student protestors are now staging sit-ins at university buildings in London, Oxford and Cardiff after yesterday's violence in London (24 November). Universities in England are more popular than ever with more courses and more students on them. But that means it costs more and someone has to pay. The government, both the old Labour one and the new coalition one, cut back on university spending as part of the plan to deal with the deficit. That is central to this issue. Universities need more money to deal with more students but the government is spending less. So who should foot the bill; Taxpayers, students, parents or graduates? Who should pay? The man who advised the government on reforming the system is ex-oil boss of BP Lord Browne. He said graduates should pay. He also said universities in England will be allowed to charge up to £9,000 a year in fees, three times the current limit. But Browne also advised that no one would have to pay up front and students will only start to pay back once they've graduated and are earning well. £21,000 a year is the new benchmark. One of the big issues here is how do you let universities charge more, to meet the rising cost of increasingly popular course, but at the same time ensure that prospective students aren't put off by the debt? The government's answer is: nothing to pay upfront, increase the amount you earn before you have to start paying back, increase grant and loan amounts to lower income students. The top universities like Oxford and Cambridge, who will presumably be charging the top whack £9,000 a year, will have to prove they are doing more to take poorer students. That could mean more scholarships and more effort to recruit from people and areas they haven't traditionally gone to. Labour doesn't support the proposal. It wants a graduate tax instead. Graduates would pay for their university education once they start working. Higher earners would pay more. This is most controversial for the Liberal Democrats. Before the election they promised no rise in tuition fees. It was a major policy. Now they are in government that have completely gone back on that. The National Union of Students has promised to \"chase down\" Lib Dems if this is approved.", "summary": "百余位英国学者联名投书，抗议大学受压查证学生签证。"}

His assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. In one part of the video they use a knife to remove part of his scalp. Chicago police have described the video as a \"sickening\" possible hate crime. The assault went on for two days, until the man was found disorientated, walking the streets. \"It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. \"I've been a cop for 28 years, and I've seen things that you shouldn't see in a lifetime, but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't.\" What did the video show? The incident happened in a flat on Chicago's West Side. In the 30-minute video, the attackers can be seen cutting the 18-year-old victim's clothes, dropping cigarette ash on him, pushing his head back with a foot and drawing blood by cutting off some of his hair with a knife. Several people can be seen drinking, laughing and smoking, while their bound and gagged captive cowered in the corner of the room. In other videos posted online the young man is beaten, made to drink from a toilet bowl and forced at knife-point to say \"I love black people\". An African-American woman talks to the camera, sometimes with slurred speech. At least two male African-Americans are also visible in the footage. How did police find them? The unnamed white victim is a school acquaintance of one of the attackers. Police say they found him on Monday wandering in the streets in a disorientated and distressed state after the assault. Later they say they responded to reports of an assault close to where he was discovered and uncovered evidence of violence and damage to property. They described him as facing \"mental health challenges\". They believe he may have been kidnapped for up to 48 hours prior to the assault. He was taken to hospital, traumatised by the attack, and had difficulty communicating with police, but was later released from hospital. Who has been arrested and have they been charged? Police say four people, two male and two female, aged 18, have been arrested. Three were Chicago residents, they said. On Thursday, a police spokesman said the four black suspects made \"terrible racist statements\" during the assault. But he said police think the victim was attacked because he has \"special needs\", not because he is white. Police also said there was a possibility that the incident would be considered a kidnapping. How violent is Chicago? BBC North America correspondent James Cook says the incident is shocking, but gangland violence is far from uncommon in Chicago. It recorded 762 murders last year, more than in the larger cities of New York and Los Angeles combined. In speeches and tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has made much of the crime and racial division in the city where President Barack Obama worked as an activist and a senator. The incoming president now faces the much tougher challenge of turning damning words into useful actions. What has been the reaction? The incident has provoked a strong reaction on Twitter, especially among alt-right - the fringe group that celebrated Mr Trump's election win with Nazi salutes. They say the mainstream media has been slower to react, and the police slower to label it a hate crime, than if a black person had been assaulted by white people. The hashtag #BLMKidnapping was adopted by users suggesting the Black Lives Matter campaign was in some way involved, although police have not mentioned the organisation in connection with the incident. Some people, however, used the hashtag to dismiss the suggestion as completely unfounded. It was trending worldwide and in the US, with more than 280,000 posts in 12 hours. Torture video prompts online race fight What does Facebook say? The video was streamed on Facebook Live for 30 minutes, but the company later removed it. A spokesman told Associated Press the social media giant does \"not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook\". Some versions of the video have also been removed from YouTube, after users reposted it. Facebook detailed its policy on live-streaming in July 2016, after the filming of the aftermath of an incident in which a police officer shot a black man dead in St Paul, Minnesota. The company says its rules for live video are the same as for other content. Footage will not be removed simply because it is violent or graphic, but if it is shared to mock the victim or celebrate the violence it will be taken down. Live videos can be reported to a team which is on call 24 hours a day. Reviewers in the team can interrupt a live stream if it breaches Facebook's community standards. In June, Chicago man Antonio Perkins, 28, was shot dead while live-streaming a video of himself on Facebook.", "summary": "美国芝加哥一名男子被虐待的过程被人用脸书（Facebook）直播传播到网上，警方拘捕四人。"}

We asked three people what they did when confronted by a gunman threatening their lives. 'I fought for my life' Heather Bryant, 42, Maryland One evening I was working alone in a store and a man walked in and put a gun to my chest, demanding money. With the gun pointed toward my chest I slowly bagged up the cash. I put all the money in a bag and handed it over to him, thinking \"he's going to leave now\". He didn't leave. He told me to shut my mouth and cursed at me. He told me to take him back into the stock room. I pretended to oblige. I had no idea how to get out of this situation and only had a few seconds to think of something. One thing that came to mind was I would rather be shot in the open store where anyone walking by may see me versus back in a tiny stock room with no windows or doors and no way to escape. I remember thinking I was not going in that stock room with this man and his gun. Period. I pretended to open the stock room door. As I did he momentarily took the gun off my chest giving me a split second to throw a metal display case over his head. He dropped to his knees. Money scattered all over the floor. I saw the gun was no longer in his hand. But now he was furious with me. I knew I had to keep fighting. As we went at each other a woman outside, startled by the noise, peered into the window. This scared him, and he grabbed the gun and ran away. As he left he told me he would be back for me. I know many people have a freeze that comes over them when confronted by this type of danger. They feel helpless and weak and they can't move. For some reason my instinct was to fight, and I'm glad I did. I had no choice. 'We fought, and then we fled' Tina Ring, 53, Oklahoma This week, on the 10th anniversary of opening my liquor store, an armed gunman entered while I was working with my daughter, Ashley Lee, who is 30. He came towards us holding a shotgun and demanded money from our register. I remember thinking: \"Really?\" Nothing like this had ever happened before. I had no idea how I was going to react. At first, I complied. I told my daughter to open the drawer and give him the money. She did. I didn't really think during that moment, I just reacted. He grabbed all the money and started walking towards the door. We ducked behind the counter and grabbed two guns that were hidden there. The next thing I remember is seeing his face as he came back around the counter. I don't remember pulling the trigger, but I did. When he grabbed me, I recognised him as a customer that had entered the store an hour earlier. I said: \"I know you.\" I wish I hadn't said that because it sent him into a panic. All I remember from these terrifying minutes was trying to protect my daughter. I shot him, she shot him. But he never went down. I was scared for my daughter and I was scared for my life. We fought, and then we fled. As soon as we were out of his grasp we sprinted out the door and ran away. He came after us but we managed to get away. I'm thankful he's alive. I wasn't trying to hurt him. I just wanted him to stop terrorising my daughter. You really never know how you're going to react in that situation until it happens to you. 'I couldn't move, I was frozen' Len Penzo, 54, California When I was 16, I worked at a local supermarket in my hometown. It was a weekend shift and the place was hopping. I was bagging groceries for a customer when I heard the screeching tyres of a car that had violently backed up to the supermarket doors. At first I didn't really think too much about it - I figured it was simply some ticked-off driver who decided to park in the no-parking zone. I was wrong. The next thing I knew three guys wearing pantyhose [sheer tights] over their faces stormed into the store screaming at the top of their lungs. \"Nobody move! Hands in the air!\" One of the robbers turned his gun on the people in the checkout line, shouting obscenities and telling them to keep their hands in the air. I was in a state of disbelief at what was happening. In the back of my mind, I still hadn't truly processed the danger that we were all in. The whole thing was so surreal. The third robber ran towards me carrying a shotgun. He told me to get on the floor so he could get into the cash register behind me. Unfortunately for me, I was paralysed with fear and my legs wouldn't move. He screamed his command and swore at me again: \"I said get on the floor!\" I couldn't move. I was frozen. Visibly frustrated, he lunged at me and threw me to the ground, face down. He took his shotgun, placed it on the back of my head, and told me not to move or he'd blow my head off. I thought my life was over. He was angry with me for slowing them down. It's hard to describe the feelings that swim through your brain when somebody has a gun to your head. Aside from fear, the most powerful feeling I experienced was utter helplessness. You're literally at the mercy of somebody who couldn't care less if you live or die; as a result, your life literally hangs in the balance. I remember thinking about what it would feel like when he pulled the trigger. I remember thinking about my mom and dad and sister, and I prayed to God too. It seemed like an eternity, but it couldn't have been more than a minute before the robbers finished their job. That's when they bolted out the door. Looking back, I suspect the paralysing fear I experienced was the result of being in a position where I subconsciously determined that neither fight or flight was an appropriate response.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普在佛罗里达发生校园枪击事件后表示，如果换了是他，碰到这种情况就会冲进去（阻挡枪击者）。"}

Videos are posted most days and one promoting a blue giant mystery egg bearing Ryan's face has had more than a million views since Sunday. The Dude Perfect channel was in third place, making $20m, Forbes said. Ryan's earnings, which do not include tax or fees charged by agents or lawyers, have doubled compared with the previous year. Asked by NBC why kids liked watching his videos, Ryan - who is now eight - replied: \"Because I'm entertaining and I'm funny.\" Since the channel was set up by Ryan's parents in March 2015, its videos have had almost 26 billion views and amassed 17.3 million followers. Forbes said all but $1m of the $22m total is generated by advertising shown before videos, with the remainder coming from sponsored posts. The amount generated by sponsored posts is small compared with other top YouTubers, Forbes writes. It is \"the result not only of how few deals Ryan (or his family) chooses to accept, but also the fact that his pint-sized demographic isn't exactly all that flush\". The toys featured in one of the channel's videos can sell out instantly. In August, Walmart began selling an exclusive range of toys and clothing called Ryan's World, and a video showing Ryan and his parents searching for his own toys at a Walmart store has had 14 million views in three months. The revenues from the Walmart deal are set to substantially increase Ryan's total earnings next year. As he is still a child, 15% of Ryan's earnings are put into a bank account that he can only access when he becomes a legal adult. Ryan's twin sisters haven't been left out of the fun either: they feature in some videos on a related YouTube channel called Ryan's Family Review. A video titled \"Top 10 Science Experiments you can do at home for kids\" starring the three children has had more than 26 million views: Daniel Middleton, the Minecraft gamer who topped the 2017 list with earnings of $16.5m, has slipped to fourth place. While Jake Paul moved up six places to second, his brother Logan Paul has tumbled down the Forbes rankings this year to 10th place with $14.5m - still $3m more than 2017. Logan Paul apologised in January after showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan in one of his videos. Google, which owns YouTube, removed Paul's channels from its Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators, in the wake of the controversy.

On the other hand, regular exercise reduces the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers. The University of Cambridge study showed that even in cities with high pollution levels, the benefits outweigh the risks. The researchers used computer simulations to compare data on different kinds of physical activity and different levels of air pollution in locations around the world. It found that for an average air pollution concentration in an urban area, the tipping point - when the risks begin to outweigh the benefits - comes after a huge seven hours of cycling or 16 hours of walking a day. It is far beyond what most people would ever do. \"Even in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world - with pollution levels 10 times those in London - people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits,\" said Dr Marko Tainio, the lead author of the study. He added: \"We should remember, though, that a small minority of workers in the most polluted cities, such as bike messengers, may be exposed to levels of air pollution high enough to cancel out the health benefits of physical activity.\" The study, published in Preventive Medicine, said exercise was always beneficial in London. 'Action still needed' The average air pollution level for cities around the globe is 22 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In London the air pollution level was recorded at 16 micrograms per cubic metre in 2011. Senior author Dr James Woodcock added: \"Whilst this research demonstrates the benefits of physical activity in spite of air quality, it is not an argument for inaction in combating pollution. \"It provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bikes - which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity.\" The research was carried out by experts from the University of Cambridge's Centre for Diet and Activity Research and Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, along with researchers from the University of East Anglia.", "summary": "一项研究显示，即使是在空气污染的环境下，骑自行车和步行对健康所带来的好处仍然大于暴露于有害空气中带来的风险。"}

French police have warned that they will use force if the migrants refuse to move to nearby shipping containers. But many migrants fear they will be required to claim asylum in France and give up hope of travelling to Britain. French authorities believe about 1,000 migrants will be affected by the eviction plan while aid agencies say the number of people living there is much higher. On Tuesday, riot police entered the camp with shields, batons, helmets and tear gas - prepared for trouble, but meeting little resistance, reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in Calais. They were followed by bulldozers, which cleared away wooden pallets, blankets and debris. Those living in the camp, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, hope to cross the Channel to the UK, often using people traffickers to try to enter illegally. About 100 shacks were dismantled on Monday. At least 12 shelters were set ablaze. 'Borders of pain' - media analysis by BBC Monitoring In France, the camp clearance is generally not on the front pages, although regional daily La Voix du Nord is headlined \"Jungle set ablaze\". National paper Le Figaro has a feature on migrants who are so fed up with the life in the Jungle that they want to go home. \"We're treated like animals. We're slowly dying,\" Afghan Nasrat says. In Germany, the papers focus on Monday's storming of the Greek-Macedonian border and the continuing debate over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal migration policy. \"Europe's pain threshold,\" says a headline in Die Welt, using a word that also translates as \"borders of pain\". \"Athens loses control over refugees,\" says Sueddeutsche Zeitung, arguing in a in a commentary that the \"suffering\" on display in Greece vindicates Mrs Merkel's approach, while an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung believes Ms Merkel is failing to win over the other EU states and Turkey. The story is also well covered in Russia, whose government - according to some - sees the refugee crisis as a way to sow division in the EU. On Monday, under cover of darkness, migrants tried to access lorries on the motorway heading towards the port. French media say about 150 people, some wielding sticks and iron bars, walked on to the road to block vehicles. Riot police fired tear gas, forcing them back, our correspondent reports. In pictures: Anger as 'Jungle' cleared At least four people, including activists from the UK-based No Borders group, were arrested during Monday's unrest, police say. Earlier, Good Chance, a theatre group which works in the camp, said police were stopping volunteers from entering the camp. French officials say public areas such as places of worship or schools will not be affected. They describe the clearance as a \"humanitarian operation\". Conditions in the southern sector are squalid and the camp's sprawling presence has become a controversial issue in both France and the UK. The Jungle in numbers Tea, rivalry and ambition at 'Jungle hotel' Jungle migrants prepare to move Migrants resist relocation to containers Officials say migrants can either move into converted containers in the northern sector of the camp, where there is room for 1,500 people; move to similar accommodation centres elsewhere in France; or claim asylum in France. But many residents are reluctant to leave the Calais area. Afghan migrant Hayat Sirat told AP news agency: \"Going to Britain... is what people [here] want.

The records reveal \"chronic losses and years of tax avoidance\", it says. Mr Trump called the report \"fake news\". \"Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,\" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. \"The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me well… they treat me very badly,\" he said. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was \"provided by sources with legal access to it\". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. What are the key claims? The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, \"largely because he reported losing much more money than he made\". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS \"portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes\". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics, the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\". \"Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,\" he said. By using the term \"personal taxes\", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. What else does the report say? The newspaper also claims that \"most\" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - \"report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year\". \"That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,\" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from \"lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour\" from the president. The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money \"from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics\". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to \"carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years\". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story \"goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman\". \"You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,\" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: \"That makes me smart.\" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. What has the reaction been? Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken \"extraordinary measures\" to \"game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes\". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. Unwanted distraction for Trump or more? So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.", "summary": "《纽约时报》发布调查，指美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）在2016年竞选美国总统和入主白宫后的第一年都只缴纳了750美元（人民币约5115元）的联邦所得税。"}

Populism is on the rise - especially among Europe's right, and in the US, where it helped crown Mr Trump. Italy's populist Five Star Movement and anti-immigrant League parties have emerged as two major players in the latest elections - the most recent of several such results in Europe. But there's a difference between being popular and being populist. The pure people In political science, populism is the idea that society is separated into two groups at odds with one another - \"the pure people\" and \"the corrupt elite\", according to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. The term is often used as a kind of shorthand political insult. Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of populism over his party's slogan \"for the many, not the few\" - but that's not quite the same thing. The word \"is generally misused, especially in a European context,\" according to Benjamin Moffitt, author of The Global Rise of Populism. The true populist leader claims to represent the unified \"will of the people\". He stands in opposition to an enemy, often embodied by the current system - aiming to \"drain the swamp\" or tackle the \"liberal elite\". \"It generally attaches itself to the right in a European context… but that's not an iron rule,\" Dr Moffitt said. Rise of the Right Populist parties can be anywhere on the political spectrum. In Latin America, there was Venezuela's late President Chávez. In Spain, there is the Podemos party, and in Greece the label has also been applied to Syriza. All these are on the left. But \"most successful populists today are on the right, particularly the radical right,\" Prof Mudde said. Politicians \"like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism,\" he added. Commentators - from Time magazine to the President of the European Commission - have been warning about the rise of right-wing populism for years. But in reality, it's nothing new. \"Political scientists have been catching on to this for the last 25-30 years,\" Dr Moffitt says - but admits \"there's been an acceleration.\" Experts point to both societal changes like multiculturalism and globalism, and more concrete crises as behind the rise of populist parties in Europe. Martin Bull, Director of the European Consortium of Political Research (ECPR), says the emergence of populist parties in Europe could be seen in the early 2000s - but they remained small for several years. The swell in support seemed to happen \"from 2008 - and particularly in 2011, when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis\", he said. It was a rare occasion when an elite class - the wealthy bankers - could be identified as more or less directly responsible for a crisis which affected the majority of society. 'I am the people' In his book The Global Rise of Populism, Dr Moffitt argues that there are other traits associated with the typical populist leader. One is \"bad manners\", or behaving in a way that's not typical of politicians - a tactic employed by President Trump and the Philippines' President Duterte. The other, he says, is \"perpetuating a state of crisis\" - and always seeming to be on the offensive. \"A populist leader who gets into power is 'forced' to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be,\" according to Prof Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University. She argues that populist content is \"made of negatives\" - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism's strengths - it is versatile. It is \"extraordinarily powerful because it can adapt to all situations,\" she said. Another common thread among populist leaders is they tend to dislike the \"complicated democratic systems\" of modern government - preferring direct democracy like referendums instead, according to Prof Bull. That also ties in to its links to authoritarianism, he argues - a lack of trust in the established system gives rise to \"strongman\" leaders. \"Ultimately, the leader makes the decision in a way that just isn't possible in traditional democracies,\" he says. That sentiment is perhaps best embodied by the late left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who once said: \"I am not an individual - I am the people\". Such thinking \"can lead to people thinking they're infallible,\" Dr Moffitt said. \"It restructures the political space in a new and scary way\". After all, if you're not with \"the people\" - then you must be against us. That is why populist leaders are often viewed with suspicion - and why the term is often used as a type of insult for a politician who promises too much. It's what Prof Bull says is called \"irresponsible bidding\". \"In order to garner support, they're quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things… that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible,\" he said. \"You might question how good that is for democracy,\" he added.", "summary": "美国总统特朗普、英国工党领袖科尔宾与菲律宾总统杜特尔特，这三个人之间有什么共通点？"}

His body was found riddled with bullets and shrapnel in the apartment. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had received intelligence that Abaaoud had passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Friday's gun and suicide bomb attacks in the French capital left 129 people dead and hundreds injured. Key questions remain after attacks One of the other attackers, who blew himself up outside the Stade de France, was traced to Greece by his fingerprints, where he was registered as a migrant. In other developments: Confirming Abaaoud left for Syria last year, Mr Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. The minister also implicated Abaaoud in four out of six attacks foiled in France since this spring. He was linked to a plot in April to attack a church near Paris. Police are also investigating a possible connection to the attack on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August. In Belgium, he had links to an Islamist cell that was broken up in a raid by security forces in the town of Verviers in January which led to the deaths of two gunmen. Police sources told AFP news agency that the tip-off about Abaaoud's presence in Greece had come from Moroccan intelligence. Eight people were arrested and at least two killed in the raid on the property in Saint Denis. Heavily armed police stormed the building after a tip-off that Abaaoud was in Paris. A woman at the flat - reported in French media to be Abaaoud's cousin - died during the raid after activating a suicide vest. The prosecutor's office said it was still unclear whether Abaaoud had blown himself up or not. The 28-year-old was identified from his fingerprints. Mr Cazeneuve told reporters that a non-EU state had alerted France on Monday that Abaaoud had been in Greece. \"Everyone must understand it is urgent that Europe wakes up, organises itself and defends itself against the terrorist threat,\" he said. Abaaoud's movements 2013: Said to have first visited Syria, joining the Islamic State group before slipping back to his home country, Belgium 20 January 2014: Passes through Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport, en route to the Turkish city of Istanbul. Returns to Syria, where he becomes one of the faces of IS propaganda 15 January 2015: His mobile phone is reportedly traced to Greece from calls made to an Islamist cell in Verviers, Belgium 16 November 2015: Three days after the Paris attacks, a foreign intelligence service alerts France that he is back in Europe, having passed through Greece; police receive a tip-off that he is on French territory 18 November 2015: Killed in police raid on Paris suburb of Saint Denis, five days after reportedly heading the attacks in Paris that left 129 people dead Profile of Abdelhamid Abaaoud How the Saint-Denis raid unfolded The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the identification of Abaaoud raises serious questions for security services. He was high on French and Belgian wanted lists and yet managed to travel from Syria to the heart of Paris without ever leaving a trace. Investigators are still looking for another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have travelled to Belgium after the attacks on Friday night. More on the Paris attacks Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath Also on Thursday, Belgian police raided properties linked to Bilal Hadfi, who is believed to have blown himself up outside the Stade de France stadium during Friday's attacks. Seven of the arrests were linked to Hadfi while the other two were connected more generally to the Paris attacks, prosecutors said. What is Islamic State? IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. What does it want? IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death.

Right now, US networks don't offer any Huawei smartphones, because US security services are worried they could be used for Chinese surveillance. And yet, Huawei has still decided to promote itself at CES in some force - at a time when the company's chief financial officer faces possible extradition to the US over accusations of bank fraud. And in a climate where US-China trade relations are at boiling point. \"It makes business sense for them to come here,\" says Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES. \"Because they can meet their buyers from all around the world. So they want to be here.\" Missing firms But Mr Shapiro may be putting on a bit of a brave face. There are significant indications that some of the best-known Chinese companies have, for this year at least, taken a step back from America's premier tech event. Shenzhen-based ZTE, which had been at CES every year since 2011, was nowhere to be found at this year's show, despite being originally listed as an exhibitor. It has offered no explanation as to why, but last year Donald Trump signed an order that said ZTE equipment must not be used by the US government, or any company that wants to do public work. While Huawei does have a large stand, no executives are in attendance - a contrast to last year when Richard Yu, one of the firm's most senior figures, was a keynote speaker. This year, not a single Chinese company executive is expected to speak at the show. More broadly, the CTA says it's too early to know whether the precise number of exhibitors from China is up or down on last year, until it carries out its audit of attendees. It did tell the BBC, however, that in terms of physical floor space, the amount of room taken up by Chinese companies is roughly the same as 2018 - approximately 13-14% of the entire show. The likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Lenovo and DJI are all in prime locations. War on trade Earlier this month, a shockwave ripped through the technology industry: Apple announced that its revenues would be significantly lower when it reports its next quarterly earnings. Chief executive Tim Cook blamed China's economic volatility, and suggested looming US-China trade tariffs are already having an effect. Most analysts predict Apple will not be alone in reporting signs of strain. After all, fewer iPhones sold means fewer iPhones made in China. The complex tangle of supply chains and components sourced from all over the world in some respects makes the notion of an \"American\" or \"Chinese\" phone rather absurd. It's why all technology companies are looking very closely at the outcome of talks between Washington and Beijing. If the two sides are unable to strike a deal by 1 March, the tariffs will be in place. If that happens, the business world will be reassuring itself that a change in leadership might repair the damage. \"I have to say the [Trump] administration's part of the current tensions,\" says Frank Gillet, an analyst with Forrester Research. \"So, if that administration changes then we're going to have a reset.\" More from CES 2019: Even if the trade dispute dissipates, what isn't going anywhere is the growing atmosphere of suspicion between these two global superpowers over how they use their new technology. This is coming to a head now because of the significant progress made by the Chinese tech industry over the past decade. It has shaken off its reputation as just a source of cheap, high-quality manufacturing, or as an irritating imitator of Western creativity. Huawei took \"Made in China\" and made it \"Designed in China\". High-quality, genuine innovation and a price point that often came in significantly below comparable efforts from Apple. This has disrupted the smartphone world order. Huawei is currently second only to Samsung when it comes to global smartphone sales. Other Chinese brands like ZTE and Xiaomi are also selling well. Smartphones are just the start. One of the next major innovations is the mass adoption of 5G, a technology that should offer 20 times the download speeds of 4G mobile networks. To get there will require vast amounts of new networking infrastructure - and Huawei has positioned itself as a dominant - if not the dominant - supplier of equipment worldwide. \"Huawei is the only true supplier in 5G,\" says Huawei's security spokesman, Andy Purdy. \"Everyone is else is playing catch-up.\" 'Drumbeat of hostility' The US government has blocked the use of Huawei's 5G equipment in the country, and has reportedly urged other allies to do the same. Other Chinese firms are subject to bans as well. Huawei feels the move is anti-competitive. \"From the beginning of 2018 there's been a global drumbeat of hostility by the United States government against Huawei,\" Mr Purdy argues. He adds that current political posturing is preventing progress from being made. \"It's clear to us that whatever real cyber-security concerns exist regarding products, they can be addressed. But we have to have the conversations to address them.\" Mr Purdy argues that globally many countries have embraced Huawei's technology - including the UK, which utilise Huawei products across Differing philosophy So will the US ever be fully open to China's business? It's a question that is becoming harder to answer as China graduates into what is now a hub of innovation that is surpassing the progress of the West in profound ways. When so much of the future is about how we capture and crunch personal data, breakthrough moments in technology - which we look for at CES - are less tangible. The next big thing may not be a product, but a philosophy. What's more important to a prosperous society: innovation or liberty? \"The Chinese attitude towards privacy is actually helping them advance much more quickly,\" Mr Shapiro says. \"I would defend our European and American approach on liberty and individual rights. But I also think it has to be balanced against the need for innovation and competition.\" Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019", "summary": "在拉斯维加斯会议中心举行的2019年国际消费电子展（CES）上的一角，一排华为Mate 20智能手机整齐摆放在一起，闪闪发亮。"}

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay £2.4m of taxpayer money for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home, the statement added. The new arrangement comes into effect in spring this year, the palace said. The statement comes after the Queen held talks with the couple on Monday about their future, following their announcement that they wanted to \"step back\" as senior royals and divide their time between the UK and Canada. The Queen said following \"many months of conversations and more recent discussions\" she was \"pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family\". \"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,\" the statement continued. She thanked them for their \"dedicated work\", adding that she was \"particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family.\" On Sunday, the Queen made her first public appearance since the announcement, arriving at church with the Duke of York. In a separate statement, Buckingham Palace said: \"The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family.\" HRH, an abbreviation of His/Her Royal Highness, is used as part of the title of some members of the royal family. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When they first issued that statement about what they wanted, they talked about forging this progressive role within the Royal Family, about stepping back from royal duties. This isn't stepping back, it's stepping away entirely.\" She said the question that will \"hang over them\" for the next year is what their commercial life will look like. \"This will be a test of the integrity of Harry and Meghan,\" she said. As well as repaying the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, the couple will pay a \"commercial rent\" for the property. Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess understood they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments. \"While they can no longer formally represent the Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,\" it said. The statement added that the pair would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. The Rugby Football League said it was \"delighted\" to continue to have the duke as patron, praising his \"genuine commitment\". Map Ives, director and founder of Rhino Conservation Botswana, said he had already been told by an official in Harry's office that the duke \"wants to continue\" his patronage of the organisation. \"If anything our relationship should get stronger,\" Mr Ives said. There has been much speculation on who will provide security arrangements for the couple and how much it will cost, but the palace said it would not comment on such matters. Harry and Meghan's new website, sussexroyal.com, was updated following the Queen's statement to say: \"Information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course.\" Earlier this month, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to create a \"progressive new role\" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America. Last year, they both spoke about the difficulties of royal life and media attention. The duke said he feared his wife would fall victim to \"the same powerful forces\" that led to his mother's death. A legal case against the Mail on Sunday for publishing what the duchess says was a private letter has also raised the prospect of her father testifying against her. In comments for a forthcoming Channel 5 documentary, Thomas Markle accused the couple of \"cheapening\" the Royal Family and \"making it shabby\". \"Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away,\" he said. \"It looks like she's tossing that away for money.\" 'Harder to think of a much cleaner break' They will always be, the Queen writes, \"much loved members of my family\". But that's about it. No royal title, no royal duties, no military appointments, no tours, most of their time spent in Canada, no public money. It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal. The early talk was of a much more mixed life - one where perhaps Harry and Meghan continued with some royal duties, dividing their time equally between the UK and Canada. But the contradictions and conflicts of interest were too many. There are still lots of details to thrash out. And the whole thing will be reviewed after a year. But a new life awaits Harry and Meghan - celebrities, certainly, but a different kind of royalty. 'A workable situation' Some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the UK and Canada. It is not yet known whether Meghan still intends to gain British citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the UK. While the couple intend to divide their time between the UK and Canada, it is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in Canada. Former press secretary to the Queen Dickie Arbiter said the new arrangement brings a crisis for the Royal Family to an acceptable conclusion. \"It's a win-win situation. It's the best sort of deal that they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart - although Harry and Meghan made a pretty good job of that with their bombshell announcement,\" he said. \"It's a workable situation and it's a situation that is going to be reviewed after a year which kind of indicates that the door might be just left ajar.\" Blueprint for the future? But Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan stepping away from royal duties was a loss for the institution. \"The Sussexes have won because they've got what they want, which is independence from the Royal Family. I do think the Royal Family will have lost out. Harry and Meghan brought a very magical and unique brand to the Royal Family,\" she said. She said that the agreement could also pave the way for younger royals, however. \"Prince Charles wants a slimmed-down monarchy. Maybe this is all in keeping with how the monarchy sees itself moving forward. If this works, if it's seen as a success, I think it could be a blueprint for future generations,\" she said. One question that still needs to be resolved is the issue of their security bill when they are in Canada, said David McClure, an expert on royal finances. He told BBC Breakfast that the overall royal security bill was estimated at more than £100m a year, and that one Canadian security company believed it would cost about £7m a year to protect Harry and Meghan when they are out of the UK. \"The Canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so I'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the Canadian government and the British government as to who pays for it,\" he said. If they plan to \"maximise the commercial opportunities\", the Sussexes may come under pressure to contribute to that cost, Mr McClure added. Meghan and Harry have already begun a transition phase of living in Canada and the UK. The move was agreed by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The duchess is in the Commonwealth country with son Archie, where the Sussexes spent six weeks over the festive period. On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty. On Thursday, the Duke of Sussex hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace - his first public event since he and his wife said they would step back from royal life.", "summary": "白金汉宫宣布，哈里和梅根今后将不再使用殿下（HRH）头衔，也将不再正式代表英国女王。"}

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. \"I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\" he said in an all-staff email. \"I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too.\" A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: \"We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded.\" What led to the walkout? Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (£69m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a “credible” allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the “creator” of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the company’s X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an \"error of judgement\". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times’ report had been \"difficult to read\". What do the employees want? Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: \"I’m not at my desk because I’m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that’s not working for everyone.\" They have also made formal demands to Google’s management. They are: What is forced arbitration? Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. \"Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,” said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. \"We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\" What else are Google employees angry about? Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. \"Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,” said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. \"There are a lot of ‘manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. \"I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails.\" In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the company’s work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. “We stand in solidarity with the Google workers,” a spokesperson for the group said. “It’s clear the executives won’t do this for us so we’re taking matters into our own hands.\"", "summary": "谷歌员工全球串联在世界各地办公室展开一系列的“集体出走”活动，抗议该公司对女性的不当对待。"}

Meanwhile, it said red meats were \"probably carcinogenic\" but there was limited evidence. The WHO did stress that meat also had health benefits. Cancer Research UK said this was a reason to cut down rather than give up red and processed meats. And added that an occasional bacon sandwich would do little harm. What is processed meat? Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is \"processed\" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. It is the chemicals involved in the processing which could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbeque, can also create carcinogenic chemicals. In the UK, around six out of every 100 people get bowel cancer at some point in their lives. If they were all given an extra 50g of bacon a day for the rest of their lives then the risk would increase by 18% to around seven in 100 people getting bowel cancer. \"So that's one extra case of bowel cancer in all those 100 lifetime bacon-eaters,\" argued Sir David Spiegelhalter, a risk professor from the University of Cambridge. How bad? The WHO has come to the conclusion on the advice of its International Agency for Research on Cancer, which assesses the best available scientific evidence. It has now placed processed meat in the same category as plutonium, but also alcohol as they definitely do cause cancer. However, this does not mean they are equally dangerous. A bacon sandwich is not as bad as smoking. \"For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal (bowel) cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\" Dr Kurt Straif from the WHO said. Estimates suggest 34,000 deaths from cancer every year could be down to diets high in processed meat. Red meat risk In context 21% of bowel cancers are caused by processed or red meat 86% of lung cancers are caused by tobacco 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco compared to 3% of all cancers ascribed to red or processed meat That is in contrast to one million deaths from cancer caused by smoking and 600,000 attributed to alcohol each year. Red meat does have nutritional value too and is a major source of iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, the WHO said there was limited evidence that 100g of red meat a day increased the risk of cancer by 17%. An eight ounce steak is 225g. The WHO said its findings were important for helping countries give balanced dietary advice. Little harm Prof Tim Key, from the Cancer Research UK and the University of Oxford, said: \"This decision doesn't mean you need to stop eating any red and processed meat, but if you eat lots of it you may want to think about cutting down. \"Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn't going to do much harm - having a healthy diet is all about moderation.\" Dr Teresa Norat, one of the advisors to the WHO report and from Imperial College London, said there were many factors causing bowel cancer. She told BBC News website: \"People should limit consumption of red meat and avoid consuming processed meat, but they should also have a diet rich in fibre, from fruit and vegetables and maintain an adequate body weight throughout life and limit the consumption of alcohol and be physically active.\" The industry body the Meat Advisory Panel said \"avoiding red meat in the diet is not a protective strategy against cancer\" and said the focus should be alcohol, smoking and body weight.", "summary": "世界卫生组织（WHO）在最新发表的报告中说，吃加工肉例如培根、香肠以及火腿的确可能增加患癌的风险。"}

His father played no part in the newborn's life - and when his mother Janet married two years later, the boy was given his step-father's surname, Ajao. The future killer would use the surnames interchangeably as an adult, before he converted to Islam and became Masood. His mother and her husband lived for a while in south London and Adrian was at school in Lewisham until he was 13. His parents went on to have two more sons. He then he moved to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with his two half-brothers. Adrian attended Huntleys School for Boys, having failed to secure a place at grammar school. In 2013, Masood sent an angry bitter email to his mother about his childhood - and his disappointment with his schooling. \"I remember that email,\" Mrs Ajao told the inquests. \"I have spent a long time thinking what did I do wrong… What should I have done.\" His parents later moved to rural Carmarthenshire - and after many years of being estranged from them, Masood visited one last time in the days before his attack. He left that last meeting, telling his mother, \"They will say I am a terrorist - but I am not.\" First offending Masood's first offending came when he was arrested aged 14 for shoplifting and given a police caution. His mother had sent him out to buy stationery for school - and told the inquests she could not understand why he had not used the money she had provided. He left school at 16 and and studied for a BTEC in business studies at a local college. And as he entered his later teenage years, his temper developed. His two brothers told police Masood was \"a violent but clever person who wouldn't back down from a disagreement\". His mother later told police that she had come to believe years earlier that he could end up killing someone. And that refusal to back down would lead him into a life of violence. Detective Chief Inspector Dan Brown was in charge of the Metropolitan Police's operation to establish Masood's background \"He would go out locally to pubs and clubs and his mother believes that Masood would go looking for a fight after drinking,\" he told the inquests. Despite this violence, his working life appeared to begin well. He was taken on to as a trainee manager for the now-defunct department store Woolworths, and moved to Hastings. But in October 1983, aged 18, he was convicted of criminal damage and fined £15. He later walked out of Woolworths and in 1988, when he was 23-years-old, he was arrested in possession of an offensive weapons and for threatening behaviour. Later he got into a row on a bus, leading to arrest for assault causing bodily harm. Then in 1990 he ripped a telephone from a wall in a restaurant and began to fight officers trying to arrest him. Adrian Ajao began his first serious relationship the same year after meeting Jane Harvey in Tunbridge Wells. They would go on to have two children and lived in the village of Northiam, East Sussex. She later told police he was powerful, charming and intelligent - but she would be scared when he was drunk - and they separated once after he hurt her in an incident. Four years into the relationship, he enrolled at The University of Sussex and graduated with a degree in economics - but his hopes of a career in finance was blocked by his criminal record. So he began working for his partner's firm, staying there until a more serious act of violence led to prison. In 2000, he became embroiled in a serious pub attack following a row, which he later claimed was triggered by racism. He lost his temper with Piers Mott, slashing him on his face and leaving an 8cm gash on his left cheek. Mr Mott has since died, but his widow Heather recalled the incident. \"My husband was defending someone who was working for him,\" she said. \"I don't know how it happened - Piers was just defending this guy.\" Elms/Ajao was jailed for two years and spent time in HMP Lewis, Wayland and Ford. He never returned to live in the village. This was the turning point in his life. Elms knew he was violent and dangerous - he pleaded guilty to the attack - and his partner left him. In prison, he began reading the Koran, apparently encouraged by a visiting imam who may have been called Khalid. Adrian Ajao began the transition to Khalid Masood. After his release from jail in the summer of 2001, he moved to Eastbourne - where a man who knew him as a casual acquaintance told the BBC Elms used both cocaine and bodybuilding steroids. And he was still violent. He was fined after assaulting a girlfriend - and in 2001 took part in a major pub fight. \"I first met him in a pub around Christmas Eve 2001,\" the former electrician told the BBC. \"He was introduced as 'Black Ady'. \"Everyone who met him said he was really polite, but he was in a pub one night and two guys were playing pool. \"Something was said and he battered them both with pool cues.\" The assaults didn't lead to prosecutions - and detectives believed that the suspect had intimidated the victims. \"One time I noticed a Koran and I made a joke like: 'Are you reading that?' He did not seem the religious type at all,\" said the friend. \"I spoke to my friend who lived with him for a while and he said he used to read the Koran all the time. \"The next time I saw him it was summer 2002 - he was on steroids, though he wasn't huge. \"He took quite a lot of cocaine and he seemed to like women with pink hair. He had one girlfriend and she had silicone breasts.\" When Elms and the acquaintance mistakenly thought they were dating the same woman - Elms suggested that if they weren't friends, he would stab him in the face. Attempted murder Sussex Police received reports of at least two other acts of violence in 2002 and 2003. Detective Constable Stuart Black from Sussex Police came across Khalid Masood in the critical period. \"He was trying to increase his reputation and status,\" DC Brown told the Westminster Bridge inquests. \"Eastbourne is only a small town, and he was just trying to big it up in a small town.\" In 2003 the future killer attacked a man called Daniel Smith. \"The injuries were probably the worst knife injuries I've actually seen,\" said the detective. After some kind of row over whether or not he was an undercover police officer, Masood began the attack to prove he wasn't. He lunged at Mr Smith and plunged a knife through his nose. It went through the palate of his mouth, his tongue and into his jawbone. Masood was arrested and charged with attempted murder. DC Black recalled that during the interview, the suspect was \"extremely confident to the point of cocky\". At trial, he claimed self defence and was acquitted. The judge, according to accounts, was amazed. Despite a six-month sentence for the additional offence of carrying the weapon, the attacker had to be released straight away because he had spent that period on remand. Approaching 40 years old, he had escaped a major prison sentence. And that sealed his belief in God. He later told others that he had experienced two miracles in his life. One was his daughter's recovery after a serious car accident. The other was his acquittal for attempted murder. Filled with religious zeal, he would call his mother to lecture her. \"He had met someone in prison who had advised or explained to him [the faith],\" Mrs Ajao told the inquests. \"He would telephone - he would never stop talking about it - go on and on and on. I would put the phone down, walk across the room and make a cup of tea and he would still be going on.\" What happened next is a little unclear. Police believe that the new convert briefly went to Saudi Arabia. By 2004 he was living in Crawley and using his new name all the time. He legally changed it in May of the following year. In September 2004 he married Farzana Malik, a Pakistani-heritage Muslim woman in Crawley, West Sussex. The relationship was an utter disaster because Masood was becoming more extreme in his views. \"When I visited in the New Year there was an atmosphere,\" said Mrs Ajao. \"I could feel that Farzana was separate from Adrian. It did not feel right to me. He said later he had five rules that he would like her to follow. What I felt at the time that he was too strict with these rules.\" Those rules included trying to control what she watched on TV and whether she met non-Muslims. What we have now learned is that during this critical period of being a new Muslim, Masood expose himself to the extreme worldview propagated by followers of a now-banned terrorism network. Crawley was then a centre of activity for Al Muhajiroun, the network later headed by the jailed preacher, Anjem Choudary. At the inquests, it emerged that Khalid Masood knew two Crawley members of the network who became involved in violence thousands of miles apart. The first was Waheed Mahmood, sentenced to life in 2007 for his part in the UK's then biggest bomb plot. The second was Waheed Majeed who became the first suicide bomber from the UK in the Syrian civil war. Masood and his wife split up - and in November 2005 he left to work as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia. In late 2006 he returned home and met, and later married, his final wife, Rohey Hydara. Masood worked twice more in Saudi Arabia before finally settling in Luton to teach English there to foreign students. During this period, the evidence suggests that Masood case to associate with more members of the al-Muhajiroun network. Luton was constantly targeted by the terror group - and Masood went to the same gym as a man who would later flee the UK while under investigation to fight in Syria. Eventually, Masood, his wife and their two children, settled in Birmingham - but they were effectively living separate lives by the time of his attack. He had become more and more extreme in his views, criticising her for wearing trousers and lecturing her about the Islamic State group. In late 2016, all the evidence indicates that Masood wanted to return yet again to Saudi Arabia - but his visa application was rejected, possibly because of his criminal record. Frustrated, this may have the significant final event in his road to becoming a killer in March 2017. Unbeknown at the time to their mother, Masood had a number of video calls with his young children. In some, he talked about dreams he'd experienced - and he told the children - too young to understand what it would come to mean - that he believed he was going to die fighting for God.", "summary": "英国警方议会大厦附近周三（3月22日）发生恐怖袭击事件肇事者是52岁的英国公民卡里德·马苏德（Khalid Masood）。"}

It is believed to be the first such apology by a Japanese company. One of the few surviving former US prisoners forced to work in Japan was present to accept the apology. James Murphy, 94, said this was \"a glorious day... for 70 years we wanted this.\" \"I listened very carefully to Mr Kimura's statement of apology and found it very very sincere, humble and revealing,\" he added. \"We hope that we can go ahead now and have a better understanding, a better friendship and closer ties with our ally, Japan.\" 'Important gesture' Relatives of other former prisoners were also present at the ceremony, held at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. Mitsubishi is acting independently of the Japanese government which has already issued a formal apology to American prisoners. Japanese government officials say that it is an important gesture ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of the war in August. \"We hope this will spur other companies to join in and do the same.\" said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. The mines operated at four locations run by Mitsubishi's predecessor company, Mitsubishi Mining Co. Only two living survivors could be located to accept the apology, and, only Mr Murphy was fit enough to make the trip to Los Angeles, local media reported. About 500 American POWs were forced to work in the mines from among the thousands of allied, Philippine, Korean and Chinese prisoners who were pushed into slave labour by the Japanese. 'Slavery in every way' Mr Murphy told US media earlier that he spent a year at a copper mine near Hanawa, an experience he described as \"a complete horror\". \"It was slavery in every way: no food, no medicine, no clothing, no sanitation,\" he said, adding that it was all the more galling to know that Mitsubishi built fighter aircraft used against American forces. He said that, while he had forgiven his captors, he still wanted the apology for his ordeal. Although no cash compensation is being offered by Mitsubishi, the apology was \"a big deal\", he had said. Correspondents say it is not clear why the apology has come so long after the war. The Japanese government officially apologised to American former POWs five years ago.", "summary": "日本三菱公司在美国洛杉矶的一场仪式上，就二次大战期间强迫美军战俘劳动的行为正式道歉。"}

Parliament backed British participation in air strikes against IS extremists in Iraq in September, at the invitation of the Iraqi government. RAF aircraft are conducting flights almost daily, it is believed. IS has seized large parts of both Iraq and Syria, up to the Turkish border. The new advice comes after the UK national terror threat level was raised from \"substantial\" to \"severe\" in August, meaning an attack was \"highly likely\". The updated information, being added to all travel advice pages on the FCO website, states: \"There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. \"You should be vigilant at this time.\" A spokeswoman for the Association of British Travel Agents advised UK nationals overseas \"be aware of an increased threat from terrorism\". \"All travellers should familiarise themselves with Foreign Office advice before they travel - in particular, country specific advice for their destination.\" \"Holidaymakers should be alert but not alarmed,\" she said. The four threat level categories used by the FCO in advice to travellers are: Dr Frank Faulkner, terrorism expert at the University of Derby, told BBC News that the move was \"a precaution as much as anything else\". He said that the nature of global threats made it hard to pinpoint the most vulnerable countries: \"It could well come from anywhere.\" He went on: \"The likely main countries would of course be North America, Western Europe and so on, primarily because some of these countries are involved in operations against Isis in Iraq.\" The FCO has advised against all travel to Syria and warned Britons already there to leave.

Those targeted include Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, and Sergei Chemezov of the hi-tech firm Rostec. The announcement comes after the mayor of Kharkiv, a city in eastern Ukraine, was shot and critically wounded. Hennadiy Kernes was recovering after an operation to repair damage to the chest and abdomen, but his life remained in danger, his office said. Mr Kernes used to be a supporter of former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. He then dropped his support for Mr Yanukovych in favour of a united Ukraine. Monday also saw pro-Russian separatists seize a local government building in Kostyantynivka, a town in the eastern Donetsk region. In Donetsk itself, pro-Russian activists armed with clubs and chains attacked a pro-unity rally. A number of people were injured in the clash. Western countries accuse Russia of actively supporting the activists in Eastern Ukraine - a claim denied by Moscow. Separatists were also continuing to detain about 40 people in the town of Sloviansk, including journalists, pro-Kiev activists and seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as three members of Ukraine's security service, officials in Kiev said. At an OSCE meeting in Vienna, Russian ambassador Andrei Kelin said Moscow was taking \"steps\" to secure the observers' release. But the area around Sloviansk was very tense and it had been \"extremely irresponsible\" to send them there, he added. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon later called for the immediate and unconditional release of the observers. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in a phone call with his US counterpart Chuck Hagel said Russian troops had returned to their permanent positions after conducting military exercises on the border with Ukraine. But he did not say whether the overall number of Russian troops deployed in the region - said to be around 40,000 - had been reduced. Meanwhile, Mr Hagel warned that Russia's continued aggression would result in more diplomatic and economic pressure. 'Additional costs' The US and EU first imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a number of senior Russian officials and companies after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine last month. On Thursday, the White House said it was adding to its sanctions list \"in response to Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine and provocative acts that undermine Ukraine's democracy\". It accused Russia of \"doing nothing to meet the commitments it made\" at a meeting with Ukraine, the US and EU in Geneva on 17 April, which it said had included refraining from violence or provocative acts. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow's response would be \"painful for Washington\". He told the Interfax news agency the Kremlin was \"disgusted\" by the sanctions. Among the seven government officials facing a US asset freeze and visa ban, two are seen as long-time allies: Most of the 17 companies targeted are linked to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko - individuals targeted in the previous sanctions list. The latest measures also targets some hi-tech exports that \"could contribute to Russia's military capabilities\". Meanwhile, diplomats in Brussels said EU governments had reached a preliminary agreement to impose similar sanctions on another 15 people as part of expanded sanctions against Russia.

The French scientists say the contagion poses no danger to humans or animals, but other viruses could be unleashed as the ground becomes exposed. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, from the National Centre of Scientific Research (CNRS) at the University of Aix-Marseille in France, said: \"This is the first time we've seen a virus that's still infectious after this length of time.\" Biggest virus The ancient pathogen was discovered buried 30m (100ft) down in the frozen ground. Called Pithovirus sibericum, it belongs to a class of giant viruses that were discovered 10 years ago. These are all so large that, unlike other viruses, they can be seen under a microscope. And this one, measuring 1.5 micrometres in length, is the biggest that has ever been found. The last time it infected anything was more than 30,000 years ago, but in the laboratory it has sprung to life once again. Tests show that it attacks amoebas, which are single-celled organisms, but does not infect humans or other animals. Co-author Dr Chantal Abergel, also from the CNRS, said: \"It comes into the cell, multiplies and finally kills the cell. It is able to kill the amoeba - but it won't infect a human cell.\" However, the researchers believe that other more deadly pathogens could be locked in Siberia's permafrost. \"We are addressing this issue by sequencing the DNA that is present in those layers,\" said Dr Abergel. \"This would be the best way to work out what is dangerous in there.\" 'Recipe for disaster' The researchers say this region is under threat. Since the 1970s, the permafrost has retreated and reduced in thickness, and climate change projections suggest it will decrease further. It has also become more accessible, and is being eyed for its natural resources. Prof Claverie warns that exposing the deep layers could expose new viral threats. He said: \"It is a recipe for disaster. If you start having industrial explorations, people will start to move around the deep permafrost layers. Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from.\" He told BBC News that ancient strains of the smallpox virus, which was declared eradicated 30 years ago, could pose a risk. \"If it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planet - only the surface,\" he said. \"By going deeper we may reactivate the possibility that smallpox could become again a disease of humans in modern times.\" However, it is not yet clear whether all viruses could become active again after being frozen for thousands or even millions of years. \"That's the six million dollar question,\" said Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham, who was commenting on the research. \"Finding a virus still capable of infecting its host after such a long time is still pretty astounding - but just how long other viruses could remain viable in permafrost is anyone's guess. It will depend a lot on the actual virus. I doubt they are all as robust as this one.\" He added: \"We freeze viruses in the laboratory to preserve them for the future. If they have a lipid envelope - like flu or HIV, for example - then they are a bit more fragile, but the viruses with an external protein shell - like foot and mouth and common cold viruses - survive better. \"But it's the freezing-thawing that poses the problems, because as the ice forms then melts there's a physical damaging effect. If they do survive this, then they need to find a host to infect and they need to find them pretty fast.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter", "summary": "科学家说，一个沉睡了至少三万年的古代病毒“复活”过来。"}

That made Chloe Zhao only the second woman to win best director in the 53 years of the category's history. Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, 27 years after his last competitive Bafta win. The 83-year-old, who won for playing a man losing his grip on reality, is the oldest ever winner of the award. But he was not watching Sunday's ceremony and later said he only found out he'd won when he heard cheering from the next room. \"I was sitting here painting, and I heard this cheer go off next door,\" he said after the ceremony. \"I thought, what the hell's happened? I thought they were watching a football match. And they came in and said I'd won.\" The key Bafta winners Most winners were watching live and delivered acceptance speeches remotely, with none of the nominees at the Royal Albert Hall in person. Zhao, who was born in China and is based in the US, referred to her education in the UK when she told the ceremony: \"I think I just made my teacher at Brighton College very proud.\" Her win comes 11 years after Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win best director for The Hurt Locker, and Zhao's victory means she is the first woman of colour to pick up the prize. Nomadland will be released in the UK on Disney+ on 30 April. British star Daniel Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. The supporting actress trophy went to South Korea's Yuh-Jung Youn for playing a grandmother in Korean-American drama Minari. Giving her speech in broken English, the 73-year-old said the award meant a lot because Brits were \"snobbish\" people. \"Every award is meaningful, but this one especially recognised by British people, known as very snobbish people, and they approved me as a good actor so I'm very, very privileged,\" she said. The prize for best British film went to Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller about a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, who pretends to be blind drunk when men pick her up in bars and clubs. Its writer and director Emerald Fennell also won best original screenplay. She joked that everyone involved in the film had made it for \"a packet of crisps\", and said the experience was \"the greatest thing in my life\". Fennell is best known to viewers for her acting as Patsy in BBC drama Call the Midwife and for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles in Netflix's The Crown. Other Bafta winners included Bukky Bakray. The 18-year-old was named rising star following her first ever acting role in Rocks, in which she played a teenage schoolgirl abandoned by her mother. The low-budget film, set in east London, was the joint highest nominee along with Nomadland, with seven nominations each. Rocks also won the casting award for finding its group of largely novice young stars. Other films to win two prizes included Disney/Pixar's animated hit Soul; Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, adapted from August Wilson's play about a 1920s blues band; and Sound of Metal, which stars Riz Ahmed as a rock drummer who loses his hearing. This year's shortlists included a diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time 16 of the 24 acting contenders came from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 21 were first-time nominees. More on the winning films: The night began with a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was Bafta's first president between 1959 and 1966. Co-host Edith Bowman said Prince Philip \"occupies a very special place in Bafta's history, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family\". The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Academy Awards. Unlike the Baftas, Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders. Sir Anthony, however, said he would stay in Wales, where he is having \"a quiet time\", rather than travelling to take part in the Oscar ceremony.

In the video, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. Chicago police have described the incident as \"sickening\". Torture video prompts online race fight Cook County prosecutors have also charged the suspects with aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Mr Hill is further charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor. All the suspects, apart from Tanishia Covington, each face an additional count of residential burglary. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the attack demonstrates \"a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans\". He said he has not yet spoken to Barack Obama about the incident in his hometown of Chicago, but added that he is certain the president would be angry. Police said the unnamed 18-year-old victim was dropped off by his parents at a McDonald's restaurant on 31 December to meet his friend, Jordan Hill, who later became one of his attackers. The pair drove around for two days, sleeping inside a van that Mr Hill had allegedly stolen without the victim's knowledge, before ending up at the Covington sisters' home. Police said a play fight led to a prolonged assault in a flat on the Illinois city's west side. The captive was made to drink from a toilet bowl, had part of his scalp removed with a knife, and was bound, gagged and beaten. Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said the victim finally escaped when his attackers went downstairs to confront a resident who had called police because of the noise. Cdr Duffin said the racial slurs and references to the victim's mental capacity, depicted in the video, led to the hate crime charges. One of the female attackers allegedly kicked in the front door of the neighbour's home, resulting in burglary charges for three of the suspects. The escaped captive was found disorientated and traumatised, walking the streets in shorts and sandals with Mr Hill. The victim, who had difficulty communicating with police, was taken to hospital for medical treatment, and discharged. More on violence in Chicago \"I've been a cop for 28 years,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson earlier, \"and I've seen things that you shouldn't see in a lifetime, but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't.\" In the 30-minute video, the attackers can also be seen cutting the victim's clothes, dropping cigarette ash on him and pushing his head back with a foot. Several people can be seen drinking, laughing and smoking, while their captive cowers in the corner of the room. In other videos posted online the young man is forced at knife-point to say: \"I love black people\". An African-American woman talks to the camera, sometimes with slurred speech. But the grandmother of one of the young women charged said her granddaughter is \"a good person\" who has had her \"ups and downs\". Priscilla Covington said the video does not reflect the young woman she said she had raised since she was a baby.

A minute's silence was held and wreaths were cast into the sea at the moment the Titanic sank. And a plaque featuring the names of those who died was unveiled in Belfast. The ship, which at the time was the largest vessel in the world, was built in the city. The plaque, in the Titanic Memorial Garden, lists the names of those who died in alphabetical order. Thousands attended or listened to the Belfast service, which was held at the city hall. Una Reilly, head of the local Titanic Society, said: \"We are all proud of this ship. What happened was a disaster, she was not.\" And a memorial service was held in Southampton, from where the ship set sail five days before its sinking. The anniversary has been marked in a number of services across the UK. Earlier, on the Balmoral, passengers and crew members listened in silence as the names were read out of those who died when the liner sank on its maiden voyage. Jane Allen's great-uncle, Thomas Pears, was one of those who died. Explaining the emotions she felt during the service, she told the BBC: \"It was just so eerily quiet. \"And then you look down over the side of the ship and you realise that every man and woman who was not fortunate enough to get into a lifeboat had to make that decision of when to jump or to stay with the ship, until the lights went out. \"And when the lights went out it must have been horrendous. We witnessed that tonight.\" Melinda Norris, whose relative Charles Lightoller was a surviving crew member, said: \"You still get a chill just looking at that water, imagining you have to go into it. \"We've been listening to the names of the 1,500 people who died. \"It's just an unimaginable amount of suffering took place here, so it's surreal to be here.\" Richard Hyman's great-grandfather was also on board Titanic and lived to tell the tale. Mr Hyman said: \"You imagine it's pitch black, freezing cold, nothing is anywhere near you other than an iceberg. \"The fear that must have been with all those people who were either stuck on the ship or in a lifeboat, not knowing whether they were going to survive or not. \"And people did freeze to death as well, even though they'd survived the disaster.\" Another cruise ship, Azamara Journey, which has travelled from New York, also held a service at the site of the disaster, which occurred 400 miles (640km) off the coast of Newfoundland. The sinking is also being remembered in other parts of the globe including New York, which had been the Titanic's intended destination. About 1,300 passengers, ranging from millionaires to poor emigrants, and about 900 crew were on board the Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage. The ship left Southampton on 10 April 1912. It headed to Cherbourg in France and Queenstown - now Cobh - in the Irish Republic before heading for New York. The ship hit an iceberg at 23:40 (Ship's Time) on 14 April 1912, and sank two-and-a-half hours later.", "summary": "包括泰坦尼克的出生地贝尔法斯特等等全球众多地方，在周日纪念泰坦尼克沉船100周年。"}

But the source said that Liu Xiaobo's wife Liu Xia is \"suffering mentally\" because she has now spent two years under illegal house arrest and continues to be detained. It was exactly two years ago when Liu Xiaobo, a soft-spoken academic, won the Peace Prize for his calls for peaceful political reform in China. He never collected it as he was already in a jail in China, where he remains, convicted of subversion. His wife Liu Xia, an even softer-spoken poet and photographer, has been similarly silenced. She's being held in her own flat in Beijing. She's been there for two years, detained just a couple of days after her husband was announced as the 2010 winner. And Norway too is, it seems, still being punished. The prize has nothing to do with the Norwegian government. But China continues to snub Norwegian ministers, diplomats and politicians, according to other diplomats in Beijing. Tight control But the BBC has spoken to an individual in contact with Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia's families, who has given some new insights into the couple's situation. The individual asked that we don't name them, and told us that Liu Xiaobo is in reasonable health, but his stomach problem \"is getting worse\". China's authorities allow only three people to visit Liu Xiaobo in Jinzhou prison where he's being held: his two brothers who can see him about once every six months, and his wife who sees the Nobel Peace Prize winner every two to three months, the source said. They have to ask for permission in advance and wait for notification. \"They are not allowed to go and visit him together. Only one person is allowed each time. And the police watch them during the entire meeting,\" our source told us. \"They are forbidden to talk about anything else other than family matters. The police don't want the family to bring in any information from outside to Liu Xiaobo.\" The two brothers did visit together once, in September last year. That was to inform Liu Xiaobo that his father had died. He was then allowed a brief visit home to pay his respects before he was whisked back to jail. His wife, Liu Xia, meanwhile, has not committed any crime in China but is being held in her home. \"There are two policewomen living with her in her apartment. And lots of plain-clothes police watching the compound constantly,\" our source told us. \"Liu Xia's health is not very well. Mentally she suffers a lot because of the loss of personal freedom and the worries about her jailed husband.\" \"She is allowed to go out and visit her mother and meet one of her best friends roughly once a month, escorted by policewomen the entire time. Other than visits to her husband, that's it. \"She is not allowed to go anywhere else, not even to the park or shop. And no-one is allowed to even approach her compound, let alone visit her.\" The individual added: \"What the government is doing to Liu Xia is illegal. They do this routinely to dissidents in order to prevent them speaking to the press and tainting the government's image. \"Her husband is currently the most famous dissident in China, so she suffers tighter control than other dissidents.\" 'Very cruel' His view is backed up by Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who said he was \"not aware of any legal authority for restricting Liu Xia's liberty\". \"Her relegation to this ambiguous zone appears to be deliberate, because if you can't treat [her detention] as something sanctioned or even covered by law, then how do you begin to challenge it? Liu Xia effectively ceases to exist, both as a human being and as an issue,\" he said. China's government insists Liu Xia is not being held against her will. But Mr Rosenzweig says its aim is to silence Liu Xia, her husband and their families, so there is no news about the jailed laureate. \"One of the few ways the outside world has to learn anything about individuals who have been imprisoned in China is through what their relatives learn and observe during periodic prison visits,\" he says. \"I don't know the last time that Liu Xia was able to visit her husband, but I am fairly certain that any interaction she has been able to have with him has been under the precondition that she remain silent. \"To the extent that this reflects an official strategy to counter Liu Xiaobo's influence, it would have to be deemed successful. There's only so much interest that can be sustained by a person's continued absence. \"That's why you don't see too many headlines proclaiming 'no news of Nobel laureate again this month'.\" And the friend of the family who spoke to the BBC says that, by being so harsh on his wife, China is trying to pressure Liu Xiaobo into cutting a deal to go into exile. \"The government is trying to force Liu Xiaobo to leave China by taking his wife's personal freedom away. At the same time, the government threatens both their families, saying if they try to speak to the media or leak any information their right to visit Liu Xiaobo will be taken away. \"This is very cruel. It has forced the family to keep quiet.\" But, the family friend added, Liu Xiaobo will not agree to leave China, despite the fact that his prison term lasts until 2020. \"The government has always wanted Liu Xiaobo to leave China because the fact that a Nobel Peace Prize winner is in jail, is a constant reminder of China's poor human rights situation. \"When previous dissidents have left China their voices gradually fade and their influence disappears. That's why Liu Xiaobo insists he'll stay even if it means staying in jail. Remaining in China is what's significant for him.\"", "summary": "BBC记者获得的消息显示，中国的共产党统治者正在向目前受到监禁的诺贝尔和平奖获得者刘晓波的妻子刘霞施加压力，以迫使刘晓波流亡国外。"}

A Belgian artist had complained that his design was stolen. Logo designer Kenjiro Sano had admitted copying online material for a previous project, Japanese media reported. In July, a new Olympic stadium design was scrapped amid a row over its cost. The logo was unveiled only last month, based around the letter T and a red circle representing a beating heart - which critics said resembled the Japanese flag. Its withdrawal is a highly unusual move. \"We're certain the two logos are different,\" Toshio Muto, director general of the Tokyo organising committee, told a news conference. \"But we became aware of new things this weekend and there was a sense of crisis that we thought could not be ignored. \"We have reached a conclusion that it would be only appropriate for us to drop the logo and develop a new emblem. At this point, we have decided that the logo cannot gain public support.\" Belgian designer Olivier Debie claimed that the design was similar to his 2013 logo for the Theatre de Liege. He and the theatre had filed a lawsuit to prevent it being used. Mr Debie expressed surprise at the organisers' decision on Tuesday as they had publicly backed the design only days earlier. He told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I thought the Olympic committee was a big machine and I didn't dare to take action against them.\" But the director of the Theatre de Liege had told him they had to \"do something\" and they sought the help of good copyright lawyers. He said the logo, devised in 2011, had been official for two years and would have been available on sites like Pinterest around the world. While Kenjiro Sano has denied plagiarising the logo, he has admitted his team did copy other work for a beer promotion and faces several other accusations of plagiarism. \"I want Mr Sano to provide an explanation. I feel like we have been betrayed,\" said Tokyo Governor Yoichi Masuzoe. Japan was seen as a safe pair of hands to host the Olympics, but Tuesday's developments cap an awkward month for the organisers. The stadium delay means it will not be ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. A promise to keep most venues within eight kilometres (five miles) of the Olympic Village has also not been kept. There may also be repercussions for lucrative sponsorship deals as Japan Airlines and other sponsors have already started using the logo.

Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. \"We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,\" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. \"Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West.\" 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was \"arguably the toughest and most rigorous\" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering\" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. \"Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,\" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. \"The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection.\" 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a \"cell\" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen \"a credible plan\". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. \"Resilience is key,\" Mr Martin said in Brussels. \"There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market.\" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.", "summary": "在光明乐观的愿景中，未来我们将生活在“智能城市”：无人驾驶汽车在智能电网上充好电后，会核对最佳路线。"}

After six nuclear tests since 2006 and more than 20 missile launches in 2017, could the North have reached a point where its military advances give it a de facto nuclear deterrent credible enough to discourage the US from ever attacking North Korea? The question is not an academic one. If Pyongyang feels secure - and the North's leaders have routinely claimed that their nuclear and other Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) assets are purely for defensive purposes - then presumably Kim Jong-un can negotiate from a position of strength with the US to secure a relaxation of economic and political sanctions. Such talks would allow Mr Kim to realise his twin strategic priorities: military modernisation and sustainable economic growth - in the process bolstering his leadership legitimacy in the eyes of his people. A prelude to further testing Official North Korean news statements accompanying the missile launch suggest that the latest launch is the culmination of a long-term technological mission - in the words of Kim Jong-un it was \"a significant day when the historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power was realised\". Yet, the test - another confirmation of the North's increasing technical sophistication - is most likely a prelude to further testing. While the US and its allies worry that the North is inching closer to the date when it can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and deliver it with a measure of accuracy against a US city, the evidence suggests that the North is at least months or possibly a year or two away from reaching this goal. It will, therefore, need to test similar long-range missiles to refine its strike capacity, including developing the targeting, and heat-resistant, re-entry capabilities needed to guarantee a meaningful deterrent. Keep in mind that testing military hardware has purposes beyond merely bolstering deterrence. It is a way of showing strength and resisting pressure from one's enemies. North Korean officials frequently point out the need not to appear weak in the face of external provocation, especially from Pyongyang's historic adversary, the United States. David and Goliath myth President Trump's \"fire and fury\" warning that he may feel compelled to totally destroy\" North Korea, his belittling of \"rocket man\" Kim Jong-un, tighter US and international sanctions, and the latest decision by Trump to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism are all evidence in Pyongyang's eyes of hostile intent. To President Trump, his tough language may appear like a shrewd negotiating tactic, putting pressure on both the North and on China to end the current deadlock, but it is woefully short-sighted and unimaginative not to consider how the actions may be seen from the North's perspective. One senior North Korean foreign ministry official has characterised Trump as \"crazy… a complete thug… just a pathetic guy and a scattermouth\". In this context, and with the North's elaborate propaganda machinery at home mobilised single-mindedly in gearing up its population for a prospective war with the South, there seems very little reason for the North to refrain from further tests. More tests strengthen resolve at home and demonstrate the country's capacity to stand up to the US. Pyongyang's narrative of resistance against the US imperialist is a simple, if not simplistic (and at heart disingenuous) re-telling of the David and Goliath myth in which the North is depicted as a plucky and resilient small state standing up to an international bully. Trump's careless tweets and public bluster only serve to bolster this narrative. Tipping the balance For now, there are no signs that the North wishes to engage in substantive dialogue with the US; nor has it shown any willingness to respond to the freeze-for-freeze initiative proposed by both China and Russia in which the North would suspend testing in return for a halt to US-South Korean joint military exercises. The region can take some, very limited, comfort from signs of partial restraint by Pyongyang. The latest test is the first since 15 September and marks therefore the end of almost two and a half months of relative quiet on the peninsula. There appears too to be a method and coherence in Kim's approach. He has, so far, refrained from red-line crossing provocations, such as missile launches at Guam or Hawaii. But how long will this last? An atmospheric nuclear test remains a possibility, and there are other low-level provocations such as a cyber attack on US and South Korean command and control capabilities, or a maritime clash around the Northern Limit Line to the west of the peninsula, that might prompt a proportionate but unambiguously tough US and South Korean counter-action. This in turn could be misread by the North as the prelude to more substantive military action and heighten the risk of low-level conflict escalating into something much bigger and mutually destructive. In these situations, as in testing, the question of sufficiency remains paramount. What one side sees as the minimum to protect its interests and a cautionary warning to its opponent, the other can easily view as a step too far and a deliberate provocation. Such actions may be enough to tip the balance all too easily away from stability and predictability into uncertainty and escalation with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Analysts say it is unlikely the group will change direction under hardline religious scholar Akhundzada. Meanwhile, a breakaway faction has rejected the move, saying Akhundzada does not represent the group. This highlights deep divisions in the Taliban following the death of the group's founder Mullah Mohammad Omar and his replacement by Mansour. Mansour was killed in a strike on his car in Pakistan's Balochistan province on Saturday. Under his stewardship, the Taliban refused to take part in peace talks. Instead, militant attacks escalated and became more daring. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, a former head of the Taliban courts, was a deputy leader to Mansour. Profile: New Taliban chief Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada Appointment signals continuity The trail of clues after Taliban leader's death Analysis: Waheed Massoud, editor, BBC Afghan service, Kabul It doesn't look as if there will be a major shift in the Taliban's approach to peace talks under the new leadership. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada was deputy to Mullah Mansour and held senior positions under the movement's founder Mullah Omar. He comes from Kandahar in the Taliban heartlands of southern Afghanistan and seems to have been an acceptable choice for a significant number of Taliban shura (council) members. The new leader is not as controversial as his predecessor, who led the militants for two years before news emerged that Mullah Omar was actually dead. A Taliban statement said the new appointment had been unanimous, the same word the Taliban used when Mullah Mansour took over. Splits soon emerged after that - this time there could still be some disagreements, but probably not enough to challenge the new leader's authority. \"Hibatullah Akhundzada has been appointed as the new leader of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) after a unanimous agreement in the shura (supreme council), and all the members of shura pledged allegiance to him,\" the Taliban said in a statement. It also said that Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, would become a joint deputy head of the movement, alongside current deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is much more well known, is leader of the Haqqani network which has been blamed for some of the most violent attacks inside Afghanistan. The group is known for its daring raids on Western and Afghan targets, particularly in Kabul. Mansour named Akhundzada as his successor in his will, Taliban sources told AFP, in what may be an attempt to legitimise the transition. A spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, urged the new Taliban leader to join talks. \"We invite Mula Hibatullah to peace. Political settlement is the only option for the Taliban or new leadership will face the fate of Mansour,\" Javid Faisal tweeted. In 2015 the Taliban was deeply divided over the selection of Mullah Mansour as the new leader. The fact that Akhundzada comes from the traditional Taliban stronghold of Kandahar is likely to please rank-and-file fighters, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul says. But there is already controversy surrounding his appointment, with a splinter faction led by Mullah Mohammad Rasool saying it will reject the group's new leadership. \"I believe this appointment is done by outsiders. This does not represent the Taliban movement,\" the faction's deputy head and spokesman, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, told the BBC. \"We call them a group for the benefit of foreigners. They cannot represent Afghans and the Taliban. And we are standing against them.\" Separately on Wednesday, 11 people were killed and many others were injured in a suicide attack that hit a bus carrying court employees in Kabul.

But his sense of humour is indestructible. When we meet he points to his walking stick. \"Look\", he says, \"now I need three legs to get around!\" Mr Gorbachev agreed to talk to me about the moment the world changed: the day the Soviet superpower fell apart. \"What happened to the USSR was my drama,\" he tells me. \"And a drama for everyone who lived in the Soviet Union.\" 'It was a coup' On 21 December 1991, the evening news bulletin on Russian TV began with a dramatic announcement: \"Good evening. This is the news. The USSR no longer exists…\" A few days earlier, the leaders of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine had met to dissolve the Soviet Union and form a Commonwealth of Independent States. Now, eight other Soviet republics had decided to join them. Together they had defied Mikhail Gorbachev: the Soviet leader had been struggling to keep the republics together in a single state. \"Behind our backs there was treachery. Behind my back,\" Mr Gorbachev tells me. \"They were burning down the whole house just to light a cigarette. Just to get power. They couldn't get it through democratic means. So they committed a crime. It was a coup.\" On 25 December 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev announced his resignation as Soviet president. At the Kremlin, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time. \"We were well on the way to a civil war and I wanted to avoid that,\" Mr Gorbachev recalls. \"A split in society and a struggle in a country like ours, overflowing with weapons, including nuclear ones, could have left so many people dead and caused such destruction. I could not let that happen just to cling on to power. Stepping down was my victory.\" What about Putin? In his resignation speech, Mr Gorbachev claimed that, as a result of his perestroika reform programme, society \"had acquired freedom\". Twenty-five years on, I ask him whether he thinks that freedom is under threat in today's Russia. \"This process hasn't been completed,\" he replies. \"We need to speak frankly about this. There are some people for whom freedom is an annoyance. They don't feel good with it.\" \"Do you mean Vladimir Putin?\" I ask. \"You'll have to guess who I mean,\" he replies. \"This is one question I'll leave you to answer.\" In our conversation, Mikhail Gorbachev avoids direct criticism of Vladimir Putin. But he drops several hints that he and President Putin have their differences. \"Does Putin ever ask your advice?\" I ask. \"He knows everything already,\" replies Mr Gorbachev. \"Everybody likes to do things their own way. C'est la vie, as the French say.\" Western 'provocation' The former Soviet president is scathing of modern Russia. \"Bureaucrats,\" he tells me, \"stole the nation's riches and began to create corporations\". He criticises one of President Putin's closest associates, Igor Sechin, head of the oil giant Rosneft, accusing him of trying to influence affairs of state. He attacks the West, too, accusing it of \"provoking Russia\". \"I'm sure that the Western press - and that includes you - has been given special instructions to discredit Putin and get rid of him. Not physically. Just to make sure he steps aside. But, as a result, his popularity rating here has reached 86%. Soon, it will be 120%!\" It was Mikhail Gorbachev's warm relationship with the late US President Ronald Reagan that paved the way for the end of the Cold War. So what does Mr Gorbachev think about the new man heading for the White House? Has he ever met Donald Trump? \"I've seen his high-rise buildings, but I haven't had the chance to meet him in person, so I cannot judge his views and policies,\" Mr Gorbachev tells me. \"But it's an interesting situation. In Russia everyone thought the Democrats would win - me included, although I didn't say it.\" In the West, many people view Mikhail Gorbachev as a hero: as the man who gave freedom to Eastern Europe and allowed the reunification of Germany. But to many in his homeland, Mr Gorbachev is the leader who lost their empire. Mikhail Gorbachev - key dates: 1931 - Born in Privolye, a rural area in Stavropol, southern Russia 1955 - Graduates from Moscow State University law school, member of Communist Party (CP) 1970 - CP First Secretary in Stavropol 1980 - Full member of Soviet CP Politburo 1985 - Politburo elects him General Secretary of CP 1987-1989 - Pushes through far-reaching reforms, called \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (restructuring) 1987 - Signs major nuclear disarmament treaty with US 1990 - Agrees to reunification of Germany after fall of Berlin Wall in 1989 1991 - Detained during abortive coup by Soviet hardliners in August, then resigns in December Soviet sing-along \"Do you accept any responsibility for the fall of the USSR?\" I ask him. \"What upsets me is that, in Russia, people don't sufficiently understand what I set out to achieve and what I actually did,\" he says. \"For the country, and for the world, perestroika opened the way to co-operation and peace. I'm only sorry I was unable to see it through to the end.\" At the end of the interview, Mikhail Gorbachev and I move over to his piano. I play and Mr Gorbachev sings some of his favourite Soviet hits. These impromptu singsongs have become a curious but lovely tradition after a Gorbachev interview. The man who changed the world with perestroika loves to croon. \"Between the past and the future is the blink of an eye,\" he sings, \"and that instant is what we call life.\" The Soviet Union passed in the blink of an eye. What are 70 years compared to the Roman or Ottoman empires? But I believe it is unfair to blame Mr Gorbachev - or the breakaway republics - for destroying the Soviet empire. The USSR may have been flawed from the start: economically, politically and ideologically.

To recover, we must restore the American dream - a society where each person can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children. \"As Treasury Secretary, I will work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all.\" President of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde praised Mr Biden's choice, writing in a tweet: \"Her intelligence, tenacity and calm approach make Janet a trailblazer for women everywhere.\" Republican Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Chuck Grassley said that he expects Ms Yellen to \"get a favourable view\" during confirmation hearings before his committee. What about the other names? Biden transition officials said the senior economic team is set to include \"several historic trailblazers\". Picks include former Obama administration official Wally Adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary and economist Cecilia Rouse as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. If confirmed, Mr Biden's team said both would be the first African Americans in those roles. Mr Biden will nominate Neera Tanden, who worked with the Obama administration on the creation of Obamacare, to head the Office of Management and Budget. If confirmed, she would be the first woman of colour and first South Asian American to lead the agency. But she is likely to be at the centre of the hardest confirmation fight in the Senate. Critics have found tweets by her from four years ago, in which she appeared to stoke debunked conspiracy theories that Russian hackers changed votes in the 2016 election in favour of Mr Trump. On Monday, the Biden campaign also trumpeted its all-female press team, prompting the Trump White House to point out that its press team has been led by women since 2017, even if some of the lower-level aides are men. Neera Tanden pick draws controversy Joe Biden might have his first big presidential appointment fight on his hands. The president-elect's choice of Neera Tanden, a longtime Democratic operative, to be his White House budget office director - which requires Senate confirmation - is getting sharp attacks from the left and the right. Grass-roots liberals don't like Tanden because of her outspoken criticism of the party's progressive movement and its standard-bearer, former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. Conservatives don't like her because of her personal jabs at their leaders. And Tanden's views are well-documented, given that some of her most incendiary comments came on social media. Concern about problematic tweets might seem quaint after four years of Donald Trump's presidency, of course. And the Senate's 2018 confirmation of Ric Grenell - a notorious Twitter provocateur - to be Trump's ambassador to Germany suggests that inflammatory social media posts are not by themselves disqualifying. Grenell, however, had a Republican majority supporting his nomination. Pending the outcome of Georgia's Senate races, Biden could face a chamber controlled by the opposition - and a left flank disinclined to help. Biden has touted his ability to work with the Senate to get things done. If he wants Tanden, this will be an early test of his skills. What's the latest with the election aftermath? Monday's nominations came as Arizona and Wisconsin officially certified Mr Biden's victory. President Donald Trump is expected to issue legal challenges to the vote in both states. At the Trump campaign's request, a second recount is due to be completed by Wednesday in another state where Mr Biden was declared the winner, Georgia. On Monday, Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said those trying to overturn the election results in the state were \"dishonest actors\" spreading \"massive amounts of disinformation\". He added: \"There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and, frankly, they're misleading the president as well, apparently.\" The Trump campaign is also mounting legal challenges to Mr Biden's victories in Michigan and Nevada. The campaign has seen other lawsuits it filed dismissed in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan.

The film rights to the superhero are owned by Sony - but he could appear in movies like Avengers: Endgame due to a deal between Sony and Marvel Studios - owned by Disney. Sony says it hopes things \"might change in future\". In a series of tweets, Sony thanked Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige for his \"help and guidance\" with the franchise. Feige played a big creative role in the last two Spider-Man films, starring British actor Tom Holland, and successfully integrated the webslinger into its multi-billion dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). What's going on with Spider-Man? It's complicated. Spider-Man is a Marvel comic book character - but in 1999 Sony bought the film rights for the superhero. Sony made five films of its own featuring the character - three with Tobey Maguire and two with Andrew Garfield. In 2015 the studio struck a deal with Disney and Marvel Studios, to bring Peter Parker and his alter-ego into the MCU. The deal meant Disney would co-produce and share profits from films featuring Spider-Man. Since then he's been in five Marvel movies: What does this mean for new Spidey films? Radio 1 and 1Xtra's film critic Ali Plumb points out that Tom is still contracted to Sony for two more films so \"this doesn't mean we're not going to see him anymore\" but the movies might look different. \"There's more of a risk for these new, only-Sony Spider-Man movies not being as good as previous Disney-made Spider-Man films.\" But it could be an opportunity for Sony to be more \"adventurous\" and \"edgy\", Ali says, even if they can't reference other MCU characters. \"They will be forbidden from doing so because they don't own the rights to any of those Disney Marvel characters.\" That's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk and the rest. Entertainment website Deadline has reported over the last few months that Disney and Sony were \"unable\" to reach new terms for funding of future movies. And it was noticed at Comic-Con last month Marvel's announcements for its next phase of films and shows failed to include Spider-Man. How is the Marvel world reacting? Actor Jeremy Renner, who plays Hawkeye, has posted on Instagram, asking for Spider-Man to be returned to Marvel. And Ryan Reynolds, who plays superhero Deadpool, answered a fan who'd asked if they'll see a Spider-Man and Deadpool movie saying \"You can. But only in my heart\". The split between Sony and Disney also has people reacting online, from anger towards Sony, to fans who hope Tom Holland is OK. Some have been using the hashtag #BoycottSony, saying they don't want to watch films coming out this year by the studio because of the Spider-Man announcement. #SaveSpidey has also been trending in the UK this morning. And a lot of fans have been sharing an old tweet from Stan Lee, the co-creator of Spider-Man who passed away last year. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Part of the US force entered at Poland's Olszyna border crossing with Germany on Thursday. The plan is to rotate the forces every nine months. Other nations involved in the rotation are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. The US Armoured Brigade will also carry out military exercises in the Baltics, all part of President Obama's response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine and to reassure nervous Nato allies.

The election of Mr Trump has raised questions as to whether this heightened US military posture will continue, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports from Poland.

Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the money would be offered on commercial terms, but the government would not take any control over the business. At least two potential buyers have shown interest in buying the business. One option is a management buyout backed by the chief of Tata's Port Talbot factory, the UK's largest steel operation. Steel company Liberty House, owned by Sanjeev Gupta, has also said it was interested in buying parts of the business. Details emerge of Tata bid consortium Port Talbot steel boss in Tata UK bid Britain's steel industry: What's going wrong? Can UK steel be helped under EU rules? In addition to taking a minority stake, the UK and Welsh government said they are also willing to consider additional grant funding support, for example to support the development of power plant infrastructure, energy efficiency and environmental protection measures, R&D and training. The government also said it was working with the pension scheme trustees of Tata Steel and British Steel to minimise any pension impact on the purchaser. Mr Javid said last week that the government was prepared to support a credible buyer with a finance package, including loans, to help an industry that has been hit by falling prices, high energy costs and cheap Chinese imports. Thursday's announcement followed another visit to Mumbai by Mr Javid to meet Tata's chairman Cyrus Mistry, where the minister said progress on the sales process had been made. 'Not part-nationalisation' Tata has said that it would give the government and potential buyers time to arrange a rescue package, but that it did not want to prolong the uncertainty for customers and workers. The Prime Minister's official spokeswoman told a media briefing that the support was being offered \"in order to keep the operation safe\". \"We would work alongside a potential buyer to make sure that the government is doing what it could to support a viable sale,\" she said. \"If we were to take an extra stake it would be a minority one with the aim of supporting the purchaser in delivering a long-term future for the business, we are certainly not seeking to be controlling the company.\" Asked if it was part-nationalisation, she replied: \"I am not sure we would accept the concept of part-nationalisation. We will be investing on a commercial basis. We would not see this as nationalisation. We would not be seeking to acquire a control in the business. We don't think that nationalisation is the right answer.\" The steel industry welcomed the financial support package as \"a positive first step\". Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \"We have been calling for government to step up to the mark and provide this type of financial commitment and backing. \"We are not yet out of the woods however. Further action is still needed on energy costs and business rates whilst at EU level, we still need to see tougher action on the dumping of cheap imports. This will then provide the level playing field which will give UK companies a fighting chance to compete.\" On Tuesday, it emerged that Stuart Wilkie, managing director of Tata's Strip Products at Port Talbot, had canvassed workers about joining a bid by investing up to £10,000 of their own money. Tata Steel employs more than 10,000 people in the UK, and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby, Shotton and Teesside. The UK operations are losing about £1m a day. Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1. On Monday Mr Javid joined ministers and trade officials from 30 countries at a meeting in Brussels to discuss the global glut of steel.

However, if the virus can spread between people it poses a much more serious threat. One man in the UK is thought to have caught the infection from his father. However, officials say the threat to the whole population remains very low. There have been 11 confirmed cases of the infection around the world. It causes pneumonia and sometimes kidney failure - five patients have died. This is the third case identified in the UK. The first was a patient flown in from Qatar for treatment. The second was linked to travel to the Middle East and Pakistan. The virus is then thought to have spread from the second patient to his son. There have been suggestions of person to person transmission in earlier cases in the Middle East, but this was not confirmed. Susceptible The third UK case is being treated in intensive care at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The patient is known to have an underlying health condition which left them with a weakened immune system. This may have made them susceptible to the infection. There have been no signs of the virus spreading to staff at the hospital. Prof John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: \"Confirmed novel coronavirus infection in a person without travel history to the Middle East suggests that person-to-person transmission has occurred, and that it occurred in the UK. \"Although this case provides strong evidence for person to person transmission, the risk of infection in most circumstances is still considered to be very low.\" The exact source of the new virus and how it spreads is still unknown. The leading theory is that it comes from animals, the new Sars-like virus does appear to be closely related to a virus in bats. However, if the infection needs to jump from an animal to a person with each infection the threat would be much lower. The World Health Organization reported cases from within the same family in Saudi Arabia in November 2012. It was impossible to tell whether each patient caught the infection separately - or if it had spread between them. A WHO spokesperson said: \"We know that in some of those cases there was close physical contact between family members caring for one another, so we can't rule out human-to-human transmission.\" The two cases in the UK, with only one case linked to foreign travel, provide the strongest evidence that the infection can spread between people. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" human-to-human transmission had occurred. However, if the virus could readily and easily spread between people then far more cases than the 11 detected so far would have been detected. New strain Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, which spread through droplets of body fluids produced by sneezing and coughing. It is thought these cases do not represent a \"tip of the iceberg\" with far more people being infected with mild or no symptoms, but the infection is still being analysed. In 2003 an outbreak of Sars killed about 800 people after the virus spread to more than 30 countries around the world. The new coronavirus was first identified in September 2012 in a patient in Saudi Arabia who has since died. No travel restrictions are in place. Prof John Oxford, a virology expert at Queen Mary, University of London, said: \"This doesn't raise too many alarm bells. \"In a family things can spread far more easily than they would spread outside, people share towels and toothbrushes etc. \"If it was somebody who was not related or a nurse or a doctor - that would be a lot more serious.\" Prof Ian Jones, from the University of Reading, said: \"There is really close contact involved here, it is not 'true' human transmission in the general public. \"Although it is severe, it's not doing anything worse than some other respiratory infections, it's just a new one.\" Prof Wendy Barclay, from Imperial College London, said it was wise to keep a close eye on the virus. \"We're an incremental step closer to worrying, but it isn't a worry where we need to say there is a pandemic coming,\" she said.", "summary": "英国卫生官员认为，已经掌握了很强有力的证据证明，一种类似萨斯的冠状呼吸系统病毒可以人传人。"}

US prosecutors say the officers stole trade secrets and internal documents from five companies and a labour union. China denied the charges and warned the case would harm US-China relations. Potentially more victims In Washington on Monday, Mr Holder said a grand jury had laid hacking charges against the Chinese nationals, the first against \"known state actors for infiltrating US commercial targets by cyber means\". He identified the alleged victims as Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Alcoa Inc, Allegheny Technologies, SolarWorld and the US Steelworkers Union. \"The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,\" Mr Holder said. He said the US government rejected economic espionage as a trade tactic. \"As President Obama has said on numerous occasions, we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to US companies, or US commercial sectors,\" Mr Holder said. In response to the charges, the Chinese government said its \"stance on the issue of internet security is consistent and clear\". Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the allegations were \"made up\" and would \"damage Sino-American co-operation and mutual trust\". \"China is a staunch defender of network security, and the Chinese government, military and associated personnel have never engaged in online theft of trade secrets,\" he said. In an indictment in the western district of Pennsylvania, the heart of the US steel industry, the US named Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, all officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the alleged conspirators. FBI officials said the hacking in the years 2006-14 caused \"significant losses\" at the companies and that there were likely many more victims. John Carlin, head of the justice department's national security division, said, \"While the men and women of our American businesses spent their business days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace, these members of unit 61398 spent their business days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of our labour.\" 'Real threat' For example, Mr Carlin said that as SolarWorld, a maker of solar panels and accessories, was rapidly losing market share to cheaply priced Chinese competitors, the hackers were stealing documents on pricing strategy from them. While Westinghouse was negotiating a deal with a Chinese state-owned firm to build nuclear power plants, Unit 61398 stole secret designs for plant components, he said. \"In the past, when we brought concerns such as these to Chinese government officials, they responded by publicly challenging us to provide hard evidence of their hacking that could stand up in court,\" Mr Carlin said. Last year, cyber-defence company Mandiant published a report on a Chinese military unit the firm said was behind the vast majority of significant attacks on American federal agencies and companies. In March, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon planned to more than triple its cyber-security capabilities in the next few years to defend against such internet attacks.

Although Labour MPs were given a free vote, many used the occasion to attack Mr Corbyn, who is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons. A succession of the party's MPs accused Mr Corbyn of opposing official party policy by arguing against it at this stage with one, Jamie Reed, calling his stance \"juvenile and narcissistic\".

Possibly on Tuesday, but possibly not until Wednesday, Labour will know which of its MPs will take on Jeremy Corbyn in a leadership contest over the summer. Read more: Trident crystallises Labour doubts and divisions One Conservative MP, Crispin Blunt, voted against renewal while 322 supported the motion. The UK has four submarines that each carry up to eight Trident missiles. The missiles can be fitted with a number of warheads, which can be directed at different targets. The Trident fleet is based at HMNB Clyde, in Faslane, but all MPs for Scottish constituencies taking part in the vote, except for Scottish Secretary David Mundell, were against renewal. The SNP opposed the move, saying nuclear weapons were \"immoral\" and the continued stationing of submarines on the Clyde could accelerate moves towards independence. After the vote, the SNP said the government \"must respect Scotland's clear decision against Trident renewal and remove these nuclear weapons of mass destruction from the Clyde\". Defence minister Harriett Baldwin said: \"People put politics aside and marched through the lobbies in support of our nation's security. This was a very important vote as defence is the first job of government\". Labour's John Woodcock voted in favour of the submarines which are built in his constituency, Barrow in Cumbria, and said: \"This shows that the House of Commons but also the Labour party can take long term decisions in the future of the nation but also protect thousands of jobs across the country.\" The vote, by a majority of 355, came at the end of a five-hour debate, in which Theresa May spoke at the despatch box for the first time as prime minister. She said it would be an \"act of gross irresponsibility\" for the UK to abandon the continuous-at-sea weapons system. Although preparatory work on renewal is already under way, Monday's vote gives the final green light to a new fleet of submarines which are due to come into service by the early 2030s. 'Serious investment' Summing up, Mr Fallon said Trident had helped protect the UK for more than 50 years and to disown it now would be to \"gamble the long-term security of our citizens\". The UK faced growing threats from rogue nations, such as North Korea, as well as a more assertive Russia, he said. \"Nuclear weapons are here, they are not going to disappear,\" he said. \"It is the role of government to make sure we can defend ourselves against them.\" While acknowledging Trident was a \"serious investment\", Mr Fallon rejected claims it was a Cold War relic and could be increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. The UK, he insisted, was committed to multilateral nuclear disarmament and would reduce its stockpile of nuclear warheads to 180 by the mid-2020s. Meanwhile, Labour's policy is in flux amid continuing divisions at the top of the party. Labour endorsed Trident renewal at the last election and although Mr Corbyn and his allies oppose it, a policy review on the issue has yet to be completed.", "summary": "英国议会下院在当地时间星期一（7月18日）晚间举行投票，以472票支持，117票反对的结果决定更新英国的三叉戟核武器系统。"}

He said the survey showed that \"violence against women is an extensive human rights abuse in all EU member states\". He urged countries to take action to fight the problem, which he said \"impacts on society every day\". The report said that campaigns and responses to the problem should be aimed at men as well as women. \"Men need to be positively engaged in initiatives that confront how some men use violence against women.\"", "summary": "欧盟一项调查显示，大约有三分之一欧盟女性曾经在15岁以后遭遇过肢体暴力或性暴力。"}

In the end, voters found Mars's crowd-pleasing R&B more palatable, while Lamar dominated the rap categories. Alessia Cara won best new artist - making her the only female artist to win a major prize. Stars like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Lorde and SZA were overlooked, with only 17 awards (out of a total of 86) going to women or female-fronted bands. The imbalance was particularly incongruous on a night that highlighted the #TimesUp and #MeToo campaigns. Most performers arrived for the show wearing a white rose to symbolise their support for the movements, which tackle sexual harassment and inequality. Pop star Kesha also gave a powerful, stirring performance of her single Praying, which addresses her own experience of surviving abuse. She was backed by an all-star choir, including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello, who were dressed in white to reflect the white rose campaign. \"We come in peace but we mean business,\" said R&B star Janelle Monae, introducing the performance. \"To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up. \"We say Time's Up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\" \"Let's work together, women and men, as a united music industry committed to creating more safe work environments, equal pay, and access for all women.\" The night's other pivotal moment was a tribute to the music-loving victims of the tragedies in Manchester and Las Vegas. Handwritten notes bearing the names of the dead were projected on the stage as country music stars Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven. All three acts played at the Route 91 festival last October before a gunman opened fire on the audience, killing 58. \"All of country music was reminded in the most tragic way the connection we share with fans and the loving power that music will always provide,\" said Eric Church, choking back tears. \"We wanted to come together and honour the memory of the beautiful, music-loving souls so cruelly taken from us,\" added Morris. Grammys 2018 - key winners Album of the year: Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Record of the year: Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Song of the year: Bruno Mars - That's What I Like Best new artist: Alessia Cara Best pop album: Ed Sheeran - ÷ (Divide) Best rock album: The War On Drugs - A Deeper Understanding Best R&B album: Bruno Mars - 24k Magic Best rap album: Kendrick Lamar - Damn Mars left with six trophies in all, including the three biggest prizes: Album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. Speaking onstage, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, saying: \"You guys are the reason why I'm in the studio pulling my hair out\". He also told the story of how, as a 15-year-old in Hawaii, he performed in a show called The Magic of Polynesia, singing songs by R&B writers Babyface, Jam & Lewis and Teddy Riley. \"I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15,\" he laughed, before explaining how he'd wanted to recapture the sounds of those 80s and 90s hits on his latest album. \"Those songs were written with nothing but joy... and that's all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving.\" As well as the star's own prizes, his recording engineers won a further award for their work on the album. His victory robbed Kendrick Lamar's more urgent, political album of the night's main prizes - but the Compton-born star still took home five trophies, including best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance. He also opened the ceremony, in New York's Madison Square Gardens, with a provocative, politically-charged performance that featured contributions from U2 and Dave Chapelle. \"I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America,\" observed Chapelle in the middle of the segment. Lamar's victories came at the expense of rap veteran Jay-Z and his soul-baring album 4:44. Jay-Z won none of his eight nominations and chose not to perform at the three-hour show. But Lamar tipped his hat to the elder star, declaring \"Jay for president!\" as he collected the best rap album award. The night also saw performances from Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Pink and Patti LuPone, who sang Evita's Don't Cry For Me Argentina as part of a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber. Ed Sheeran, who could not attend the ceremony, won two prizes - best pop vocal performance for Shape Of You and best pop album for Divide. There were also posthumous awards for Leonard Cohen and actress Carrie Fisher, who won best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoirs, The Princess Diarist.

It predicted all would see people living longer in 2030 and the gap between men and women would start to close in most countries. The researchers said the findings posed big challenges for pensions and care for elderly people. \"South Korea has gotten a lot of things right,\" Prof Majid Ezzati told the BBC News website. \"They seem to have been a more equal place and things that have benefited people - education, nutrition - have benefited most people. \"And so far, they are better at dealing with hypertension and have some of the lowest obesity rates in the world.\" The data also forecasts that Japan, once the picture of longevity, will tumble down the global rankings. It currently has the highest life expectancy for women, but will be overtaken by both South Korea and France, the study suggests. Meanwhile, male life expectancy will go from the fourth highest to 11th out of the countries studied. The US also performs poorly and is on course to have the lowest life expectancy of rich countries by 2030. The study predicts an average age of 80 for men and 83 for women - roughly the same state Mexico and Croatia will have achieved. \"They are almost opposite of South Korea,\" added Prof Ezzati. \"[Society in the US is] very unequal to an extent the whole national performance is affected - it is the only country without universal health insurance. \"And it is the first country that has stopped growing taller, which shows something about early life nutrition.\" The US will be overtaken by Chile, where women born in 2030 will expect to live for 87 years and men for 81. Between 2015 and 2030, life expectancy in the UK is expected to go from 79 to 82 for men and from 83 to 85 for women. Men catching up The study, published in the Lancet, also shows the gap in life expectancy between women and men is closing. Prof Ezzati said: \"Men traditionally had unhealthier lifestyles, and so shorter life expectancies. \"They smoked and drank more, and had more road traffic accidents and homicides, however, as lifestyles become more similar between men and women, so does their longevity.\" Much of the increases are due to improvements for the over-65s rather than reductions in deaths during childhood. The study made the projections in a similar way to the methods used by meteorologists to forecast the weather. It combined 21 separate mathematical models that analysed past trends to make projections into the future. This approach indirectly takes account of all the different factors - smoking rates, medical advances, obesity patterns - that are changing life expectancy. It assumes countries continue to progress as they are, so exceptional, unpredictable events equivalent to the fall of the Soviet Union, or huge breakthroughs like a vaccine for all cancer, would massively alter the forecasts. In summary, Prof Ezzati said: \"Places that perform well do so by investing in their health system and making sure it reaches everyone.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "英国研究人员周三（2月22日）发布的一份报告指，到2030年韩国女性平均有望达到90年来的新高，这一数字远远超过之前人类被认为可以达到的寿命。"}

George was the rock-solid favourite for boys' names for a while, backed all the way down to 2/1. Alexander and Louis were both not far behind. A cynic might point out that before we knew it was a boy, Alexandra - the Queen's first middle name - had been the favourite. Of the three names, it is the significance of the third that is most obvious. Louis immediately makes one think of Louis Mountbatten, uncle of Prince Philip and last viceroy of India, who was killed by the IRA in a bomb attack on his yacht. His father Prince Louis of Battenberg was Prince William's great-great-grandfather. Louis is also one of William's middle names. And, of course, the name of 17 kings of France (or 18 or 19, depending how you count). If Louis honours one side of the Royal Family, George clearly resonates with the other. Despite St George being the patron saint of England, it took the arrival of a German king, George I, to cement the name's place in England. Long a popular name in Germany, it has Greek roots. There have since been five other Georges to sit on the throne. George III, king during the loss of the American colonies, is perhaps now best known for his mental illness thanks to Alan Bennett's play and the subsequent film adaptation. His son George was a figure who certainly attracted more than his share of criticism. Arguably the best-known portrayal of him was by Hugh Laurie in the third series of Blackadder. In that comedy, he is a drunken, philandering fool of spectacularly limited grace and intelligence. The real George was certainly both a drinker and womaniser who ate too much - the Times labelled him an \"inveterate voluptuary\" - but also an imaginative town planner, an ambitious patron of the arts and, most probably, not an idiot. The most recent Georges reigned through two world wars. It was George V who declared war on Germany in 1914, pitting him against his first cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II. George V recognised the strength of anti-German feeling and changed the Royal Family's name from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the more English sounding Windsor. It was his son George VI whose struggles with his stutter are so movingly depicted in The King's Speech. Christened Albert and known to his family as Bertie, but crowned as George, he's a reminder that the monarch has the final say on their regnal name. On the other hand, Alexander has never been the name of a king of England or the UK, but was borne by three kings of Scotland. And yet for any parent naming their child Alexander, it must be hard not to hear the phrase \"the Great\" sotto voce immediately afterwards. Alexander famously conquered much of the known world and is often described as the best general ever to live. But he was not a well-rounded individual. An epic binge drinker who once killed a friend with a spear in a drunken rage, he only made it to the age of 32 before either ill health or well-disguised murder did for him. The two later rulers of Macedon called Alexander - one of them his son - were both murdered but that has not stopped the name being popular with rulers down the ages. Perhaps the least successful Alexander was the sole Byzantine emperor to bear that name. Of him, historian Viscount Norwich said: \"The only good thing that can be said of the reign of the Emperor Alexander is that it was mercifully short.\" This Alexander supposedly died after an ill-advised game of polo in very hot weather. Modern Alexanders might want to heed his example. You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook", "summary": "剑桥公爵威廉和公爵夫人凯特为他们刚出生的儿子取名乔治·亚历山大·路易(George Alexander Louis)。这个名字背后有什么考虑呢？"}

Liberal leader Tony Abbott, who will be prime minister, promised a competent and trustworthy government. Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd earlier admitted defeat and said he would not stand again for the Labor leadership. The main election issues were how to tackle an expected economic slowdown, whether to keep a tax on carbon emissions, and how to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat. Mr Rudd had called the election after defeating Julia Gillard in a leadership challenge in June, amid dismal polling figures that showed Labor on course for a wipe-out. Under Mr Rudd, Labor initially saw its figures improve. But Mr Abbott, who enjoyed the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, then widened the gap again. \"From today I declare Australia is under new management and Australia is now open for business\", Mr Abbott told a cheering crowd as he delivered a victory speech. He said that he would put the budget back into surplus, and stop boats bringing migrants from Asia. He added that support for Labor was at its lowest ebb for 100 years, and that the results showed the Australian people would punish anyone who took them for granted. Mr Rudd said he had phoned Mr Abbott and wished him well. \"I gave it my all but it was not enough for us to win,\" he said. But he was pleased that Labor was preserved as a \"viable fighting force for the future\". Mr Rudd retained his seat in the Brisbane constituency of Griffith but said he would not re-contest the Labor party leadership because the Australian people \"deserve a fresh start\". \"I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight. As your Labor leader I accept it as my responsibility,\" he said. The Australian Election Commission confirmed on its website that the Liberal-National coalition had won 88 seats in the House of Representatives, and Labor 57. Three seats were distributed between three small parties, and there were two seats still to return results. In the previous parliament, Labor relied on the support of independents and the Greens for its minority government, with 71 seats to the coalition's 72. Assange misses out Mr Abbott took on the leadership of the flagging Liberal-National coalition in 2009. A Rhodes scholar who once wanted to be a Roman Catholic priest, Mr Abbott has pledged to repeal both the mining and carbon taxes introduced by Labor. He has also promised a raft of budget cuts, including reducing the foreign aid budget by A$4.5bn ($4bn; £2.6bn). But he says he will fund an expanded paid parental leave scheme. British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first to congratulate him on the victory, writing on Twitter that \"it'll be great working with another centre-right leader\". Australia largely avoided the recession that hit the UK and other Western nations thanks to a natural resources boom. But the boom is coming to an end, and Mr Abbott will be charged with managing the transition. Ahead of the polls, his coalition highlighted bitter Labor infighting, seeking to portray itself as the more stable party. And former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the internal divisions for Labor's defeat. \"I really believe this was an election that was lost by the government rather than one that was won by the opposition,\" he said. Julia Gillard, meanwhile, congratulated the Labor candidate who succeeded her in her seat, as she bowed out of politics. The outsider candidates had mixed fortunes at the polls. One of the two undecided seats in the House sees billionaire Clive Palmer, famous for his attempt to build a new version of the Titanic based on the original designs, on course for victory. However, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange missed out on a Senate seat in Victoria, where the final place was claimed by Rick Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party.

It is understood his phone had connected to messaging app WhatsApp two minutes earlier. Amber Rudd said she would be meeting technology firms this week. A WhatsApp spokeswoman said the company was \"horrified at the attack\" and was co-operating with the investigation. Meanwhile, a 12th arrest has been made by officers investigating the attack. The 30-year-man was detained in Birmingham on Sunday on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. All messages sent on WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption, meaning they are unreadable if intercepted by anyone, including law enforcement and WhatsApp itself. So while Masood's phone is believed to have connected with the app, police may not know what, if anything, was communicated. Speaking to BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Rudd said: \"It is completely unacceptable, there should be no place for terrorists to hide. \"We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other. \"It used to be that people would steam open envelopes or just listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing, legally, through warrantry. \"But on this situation we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said authorities already had \"huge powers\". There had to be a balance between the \"right to know\" and \"the right to privacy\", he said. The Facebook-owned company, which has a billion users worldwide, has said previously that protecting private communication is one of its \"core beliefs\". Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple which also uses end-to-end encryption, has previously said it would be \"wrong\" for governments to force Apple to \"build a back door\" into products. But Ms Rudd said: \"I would ask Tim Cook to think again about other ways of helping us work out how we can get into the situations like WhatsApp on the Apple phone.\" Europol director Rob Wainwright echoed Ms Rudd's call for changes. \"I would agree something has to be done to make sure that we can apply a more consistent form of interception of communication in all parts of the way in which terrorists invade our lives,\" he told Andrew Neil on the BBC's Sunday Politics. The victims of the Westminster attack were commemorated at the beginning of England's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley Stadium. Before kick-off, four wreaths were laid in the centre of the pitch by Metropolitan Police Acting Commissioner Craig Mackey, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, FA chairman Greg Clarke and Culture Secretary Karen Bradley. A minute's silence was also observed by fans and players. Masood, 52, killed three people and injured 50 when he drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge on Wednesday. He then fatally stabbed a police officer before being shot dead by police - all within 82 seconds. Ms Rudd would not confirm who shot Masood, amid claims it was a bodyguard for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon. Can the government access encrypted data? A provider could co-operate with authorities and decrypt data, says Will Knight, a senior editor at MIT Technology Review. But done properly, encrypted data can be difficult or impossible to access. WhatsApp maintains only those involved in a message can read the contents due to end-to-end encryption. There are sometimes \"backdoors\", Mr Knight says, and intelligence services have exploited those to retrieve the keys needed to decrypt messages. But backdoors may then be exploited by criminals, or hostile governments. Prof Ross Anderson, from Cambridge University, points out that if companies do co-operate, and try to keep quiet about it, it won't take long for the tech-savvy to cotton on. And criminals or terrorists will merely divert to one of the many other messaging services, based overseas, he adds. Scotland Yard has said it believes Masood acted alone, and while officers were \"determined\" to find out whether he had been inspired by terrorist propaganda, it was possible his motive would never be known. A 58-year-old man, who was arrested in Birmingham the morning after the attack under the Terrorism Act, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman arrested in Manchester remains on police bail.

The bills still need approval from the upper house, but many expect them to eventually be passed into law. The changes are unpopular and thousands demonstrated outside parliament on Wednesday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for the two bills, arguing it is necessary to expand the role of the military in a doctrine called collective self-defence. But polls show more than half of Japanese citizens oppose them. Reacting to the passing of the bills, China's foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hua Chunying questioned if Japan was \"abandoning its pacifist policies\", and urged Japan to \"stick to the path of peaceful development\" and avoid harming the region's stability. South Korea has similarly in the past urged Japan to \"contribute to regional peace and security\" and called for transparency in Japan's defence policy discussions. What is collective self-defence? Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for a change that would revise the laws such that Japan's military would be able to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? Most of the opposition lawmakers walked out of the lower house chamber in protest before the vote took place on Thursday, with only members of the small Japan Restoration Party voting against the bills. Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partners hold a two-thirds majority in the lower house, which is needed to approve bills. The upper house, where the LDP and partners also hold a majority, now has 60 days to rule on the bills. Even if it rejects them, the bills would be sent back to the lower house which can then pass them into law. How Japan's neighbours see the bills China's People's Daily says the new bills, if passed into law, would become Japan's \"historical shame\". A front-page commentary accuses Japan of giving in to US pressure to do more for the US strategy of rebalancing Asian power, by playing a more active role in the US-Japan military alliance. Beijing's Global Times says that Shinzo Abe, \"drunk on his own 'ideals'\", has miscalculated. \"China is Japan's imaginary enemy, but fighting China is not a risk that Japan can bear... as China is capable of dealing Japan a fatal blow.\" The official party paper in North Korea, Nodong Sinmun, sees more sinister motives. It says the bills are an attempt to turn Japan into a militarist state by stealth. \"If Japan makes desperate efforts to reinvade other counties by invoking the war law, this will bring disasters to its people,\" it warns. South Korea's foreign ministry, quoted by Yonhap news agency, says Japan should \"stick to the spirit of the pacifist constitution\". But the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says that the opposition is expected to launch legal challenges to rule the bills as unconstitutional. Our correspondent says those in Japan who oppose the bills believe they break Japan's explicitly pacifist constitution and also distrust Mr Abe, who is known for his right-wing nationalist views. Organisers of a large protest which took place outside parliament on Wednesday night said about 100,000 people showed up. \"I'm angry at both the new security bill and Prime Minister Abe. The bill is against Japan's constitution... Abe does not understand it,\" student Jinshiro Motoyama told the BBC. Mr Abe first put the changes in motion last year when he sought to reinterpret Japan's pacifist constitution to allow the bills.", "summary": "虽然在东京有抗议反对的声音，但日本下议院表决通过了两项将会改变日本安保法律的争议性法案，这些修改将允许日本军队自二战结束以来首次在海外参与战斗。"}

The Taliban said they controlled most of the town and the main administrative building had been abandoned. In the east, a Taliban attack near Bagram killed six US soldiers. It was one of the deadliest attacks on foreign forces in Afghanistan this year. Some 12,000 foreign soldiers are deployed as part of the Nato-led Resolute Support international coalition, which is meant to underpin Afghanistan's own security forces. The battle for Sangin comes a little over a year after the end of UK combat operations in Afghanistan, in which at least 450 soldiers were killed. During its deployment in Helmand, the British military suffered its heaviest losses in Sangin. Battle for Sangin Governor Rahimi gave a news conference in Helmand's provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, after his deputy, Mohammad Jan Rasulyar, said Sangin had been overrun by the Taliban late on Sunday. Fierce gun battles were going on between the Taliban and the Afghan security forces, Mr Rahimi was quoted as saying on Afghan TV, and the government had sent back-up forces. But Mr Rasulyar had told AFP news agency: \"The Taliban have captured the police headquarters, the governor's office as well as the intelligence agency building in Sangin.\" Quoted separately by the Associated Press, Mr Rasulyar said casualties among Afghan security forces were high, without giving figures. Only some army facilities had not been taken, he added. Why is Sangin important? Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Afghan Service Sangin was once the centre of operations for international forces in Afghanistan, a key district that linked Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, to the province's northern districts. Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in parts of northern Helmand and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin will not be easy, but resentment of government troops is high in the district following military operations earlier this year which locals say wrought unwarranted destruction to property. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, they should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. Read more on why Sangin matters Police officers and soldiers inside the Sangin police headquarters had appeared to be still holding out as of Monday morning. The district police commander, Mohammad Dawood, told the BBC the Taliban had completely cut the facility off from the rest of the province, and food and weapons supplies were running low. \"For the past two days we have been surrounded inside the police headquarters,\" he said. \"No one can move out because the checkpoints along the roads are gone. The roads between the district and Lashkar Gah and other districts are closed. We also have a number of injured troops and bodies here.

Meanwhile, reports say the Taliban are also close to overrunning the neighbouring district of Gereshk. The head of Helmand's provincial council, Muhammad Kareem Atal, was quoted by AP as saying that \"around 65%\" of Helmand was now under Taliban control. In September, the Taliban briefly overran the northern city of Kunduz in one of their biggest victories in 14 years of war. Motorcycle bomber The attack at Bagram, the biggest US military facility in Afghanistan, happened at around 13:30 local time (09:00 GMT). A bomber mounted on a motorcycle reportedly attacked a patrol in a village near Bagram. US officials identified the six dead soldiers as Americans, and said another two had been wounded along with one Afghan. The Taliban said it had carried out the attack in statements to media. In the Afghan capital Kabul, a US woman was killed at a gym, with her suspected attacker, a mullah, arrested.

The hatches, which consist of an incubator and a delayed alarm, increase the chances of a baby surviving. Most of those abandoned have disabilities or serious illnesses. Left with note The China Center for Children's Welfare and Adoption told the state-run news agency, Xinhua, that more than two dozen baby hatches had been set up since the first one opened in the city of Shijiazhuang in Hebei province in 2011. A number have opened in the last few months. One, in Guangzhou, received 79 babies in its first 15 days. Parents simply place a child in the hatch, press an alarm button and then leave, remaining anonymous. Someone then comes to retrieve the baby five to 10 minutes later. Abandoning a child is illegal in China, but the health authorities believe that the hatches provide a safe environment for something that would go on anyway - and gives the infants a better chance of survival than if they were dumped in the street. Previously, only one in three abandoned babies would survive. \"Laws emphasise prevention, while baby hatches focus on rescue after the laws are broken,\" the head of the welfare and adoption centre, Li Bo, told Xinhua. China's strict family planning laws have in the past been blamed for the high number of girls given up by their parents. Chinese families traditionally favour boys and so, if they can have only one child, some parents abandon girls and try again for a boy. But it seems the babies left in the new hatches are both boys and girls. Health officials said most babies left there had severe health problems and were abandoned because their parents feared they would not have enough money to pay for expensive medical treatment. Many babies left in the hatches came with notes, cash or medical records tucked inside their clothing. It is estimated that 10,000 children are abandoned in China each year. To help them, the authorities say each province must set up at least two hatches by the end of the year.", "summary": "中国当局在全国各地设立了25个“婴儿安全岛”，让那些被父母抛弃的婴儿能及时被发现和得到治疗。"}

Several of the US firm's rivals have also helped publicise the claims. Apple said nine customers had told it their iPhone 6 Plus phones had bent. In a statement the company noted that the handsets' shells had been constructed out of \"anodised aluminium, which is tempered for extra strength\" and also featured stainless steel and titanium parts to reinforce the areas of the phones likely to experience the most stress. \"We chose these high-quality materials and construction very carefully for their strength and durability,\" it added. \"We also perform rigorous tests throughout the entire development cycle. \"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus meet or exceed all of our high quality standards to endure everyday, real life use. \"With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus. As with any Apple product, if you have questions please contact Apple.\" The BBC understands that one of the checks that Apple had carried out before launching the models was a \"sit test\", which is designed to simulate the effects of a user sitting down on a hard surface with the phone in their back pocket thousands of times over the course of several years. The company also carried out a torsion test, which involved clamping a phone at both ends and then applying a twisting force 8,000 times. Stock drop Apple's share price has fallen following the publicity generated by users posting photos of bent iPhones to the internet. News that it had also pulled an iOS 8 operating system update after iPhone 6 users complained it made their phones unable to make or receive calls had also caused concern. However, one analyst highlighted that the company had been much quicker to respond to reports about bending than it had back in 2010, when customers complained about the iPhone 4 dropping calls when gripped on its left-hand side. \"It took too long in the antenna case - I don't know if this is organisational memory or not, but here Apple is going out and saying it did do tests and is stating the facts,\" said Ken Dulaney, who covers the mobile phone sector for the research firm Gartner. \"But this is probably something Apple has to look into more. \"It probably did all the tests it said it did - I don't ever find that Apple really lies about anything - but I think the people reporting the problem aren't lying either.\" Apple's competitors have taken advantage of its troubles. The official Twitter accounts of LG, HTC and Samsung have all posted messages alluding to the controversy, with LG going so far as to use the hashtag \"bendgate\", which other members of the public had used to refer to the claims. Record demand Apple had previously announced that it had sold more than 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and its larger sibling the iPhone 6 Plus. \"While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible,\" its chief executive Tim Cook said in a press release on Monday. It highlighted the \"all-new dramatically thin\" design of the handsets - a factor some users had speculated might be the cause of them bending. However, it has also been pointed out that handsets by Sony, Samsung, Blackberry and others have also bent in the past, and several analysts have cautioned that it was too early to say if the incidents involving the new iPhones were more widespread.", "summary": "苹果公司对iPhone Plus“弯曲门”事件作出回应，称新手机较易弯曲，在正常使用情况下，iPhone Plus变弯的现象“极其罕见”。"}

It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit. Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests. The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei. The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK had recently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter as \"a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner\". Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the \"noise\" surrounding the company. He said he hoped the UK would take an \"evidence and fact-based approach\" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. \"We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment,\" he said. \"We don't have time to delay this.\" Two decades Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market. And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory. In January, ministers announced that Huawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called \"core\" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system. It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk. But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China. And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. \"We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry,\" Mr Zhang told the BBC. \"We need to work out a solution.\" Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G. That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower. The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked. \"We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously,\" Mr Zhang said. 'Trail of blood' The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday to have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should \"surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood\". Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. \"We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong,\" he said. \"It is simply because of trade and protectionism.\"", "summary": "通讯科技公司华为（Huawei）迎来进入英国20周年之际，该公司将在报纸和互联网开展一场媒体宣传公关战。"}

France had until now resisted pressure to halt the delivery, saying it had to respect an existing contract. Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Yury Borisov said the French decision would not hold back Moscow's plans to reform its armed forces. \"Although of course it is unpleasant and adds to certain tensions in relations with our French partners, the cancelling of this contract will not be a tragedy for our modernisation,\" he said, quoted by Itar-Tass news agency. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin tweeted his thanks to the French leadership for its \"responsible decision\", which he said was \"important for restoring peace in Europe\". The Vladivostok, the first of the two helicopter carriers, was expected to have been delivered to Russia by late October. The second, the Sevastopol, was to have been sent next year, although no mention of it was made in Mr Hollande's statement. Analysis: Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent As the crisis has escalated in eastern Ukraine and as Russia's direct military role there has become more blatant, so the pressure on the French government to halt its sale of two advanced assault ships to Russia has grown ever stronger. The US and a number of other countries have long made their feelings plain. But the deal weathered tensions with Moscow over Syria, and the Russian crew of the first vessel which is already undergoing sea trials has travelled to France to begin training. This was the most significant Western arms sale to Russia and its postponement - the exact terms of the suspension of the deal are not clear - marks a very visible rebuff to Moscow on the eve of Nato's Wales Summit. The Mistral assault ships can carry up to 16 heavy helicopters, land troops and armoured vehicles. Their delivery would have resulted in a marked improvement in Russia's amphibious capability. But Mr Hollande's office said Wednesday's remarks by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents about a possible ceasefire were not enough to allow France to give it the go-ahead. \"The president of the republic has concluded that despite the prospect of ceasefire, which has yet to be confirmed and put in place, the conditions under which France could authorise the delivery of the first helicopter carrier are not in place,\" it said in a statement. Previously France had argued that EU sanctions could not apply retroactively to the Mistral contract, and that it would have been too costly to cancel. The deal for the two helicopter carriers is worth 1.2bn euros ($1.6bn; £0.95bn). Separately Poland has given details of military exercises to be held later this month in Ukraine. A defence ministry statement said the exercises, codenamed Rapid Trident 14, will involve hundreds of soldiers from Nato member states including the US. Peace deal hopes Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he had agreed a \"ceasefire process\" with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin said he hoped a peace deal could be reached by Friday, when representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the rebels meet in Minsk for talks. The pro-Russian rebels have said they support Mr Putin's proposals, but that they do not trust Mr Poroshenko to maintain a ceasefire. It is not clear whether any truce is being observed on the ground. Meanwhile, in Estonia, US President Barack Obama sought to reassure the Baltic states that they would be protected by Nato, and said that Washington would stand by Ukraine. Analysis: Oleg Boldyrev, BBC News, Moscow Insisting that Russia is in no way a negotiating party in the Ukrainian conflict, Vladimir Putin is nevertheless certain that it is Moscow's proposals that are going to advance both sides to peace. Mr Putin's plan is short and leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Take, for example, a point on moving Ukrainian troops away from positions from which towns and cities can be shelled. Taken to an extreme, this could mean rewinding the situation on the ground to a point several weeks ago before Ukrainian advances. Just two weeks ago the discussions centred around when, and not if, the rebels would have to move out of Donetsk and Luhansk. But Moscow's plan will allow them to strengthen their control over the two regional centres and other areas. Mr Putin has often seemed unwilling to negotiate from a position of weakness and the reversals of the past few days illustrate this perfectly. Now it's Petro Poroshenko who has to choose whether to accept something which clearly protects Kiev's enemies in eastern Ukraine. The announcements come a day before a Nato summit in Wales which is expected to discuss the alliance's response to Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. More than 2,600 civilians and combatants have been killed and more than a million people have fled their homes since fighting erupted in eastern Ukraine in April, when pro-Russian separatists there declared independence. Russia has denied accusations by the West and the Ukrainian government that it is sending troops and military equipment over the border to support the separatists, who recently gained the upper hand against government forces.

Previously unpublished, it was taken before the final night of celebrations at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in May. Fashion photographer Nick Knight, who took the photo, said he had wanted to create something that showed \"warmth, humanity... strength and tradition\". The Queen, who last year became Britain's longest-reigning monarch, turned 90 years old in April. In pictures: Queen at 90 - in 90 images She celebrated the occasion with a series of events, including a private black tie banquet at Windsor Castle with her friends and loved ones. Analysis By Peter Hunt, BBC News royal correspondent The most arresting images can be the ones that leave you wanting to know more. In this instance, what was the wisecrack uttered by the son that made the mother want to laugh as the camera captured them together? On a day in May devoted to horses this photographic assignment was over in minutes. The significance of the image is obvious. This is a 90-year-old monarch with her heir by her side. As things stand, the future of the House of Windsor is secure. One of the most recognisable women on the planet has sat, countless times, for photographs and portraits. She never comments on the finished results. Others aren't so reserved. An oil painting by Lucien Freud was said by one art critic to have given the Queen six o'clock shadow and made her look more like a rugby player than a monarch. This latest addition to the genre prompts us to wonder about the nature of the joke cracked by Prince Charles; a joke the four people in the room when the shutter clicked may well now have forgotten.

However, the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in May rose by 19,600 to 1.49 million. The rise was the biggest since July 2009, and larger than expected. \"The economy created more than half a million jobs over the last year,\" said BBC chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym. \"So even after the public sector shed just over 140,000 posts, total employment was still well ahead over twelve months.\" The official unemployment figure - which is based on a survey - has been falling in recent months. In contrast, the claimant count - which has now risen for the third month in a row - has been telling a much more downbeat story about the state of the jobs market. However, analysts caution that some of the rise in the claimant count may be attributable to changes in benefits rules, which have seen many people move off other kinds of benefits onto the Jobseeker's Allowance. Public versus private The number of people who left unemployment during the quarter was almost matched by the number who entered new jobs, according to the latest ONS survey data. The employment total increased by 80,000 to 29.24 million. Employment minister Chris Grayling hailed the data as \"very encouraging\", and told the BBC that it showed the private sector was creating jobs much faster than the public sector was losing them. Over the course of 12 months to the first quarter of this year, private sector employment rose by 520,000, while the public sector cut numbers by 143,000, leaving left total employment up by about 376,000. But shadow employment minister Liam Byrne told the BBC: \"When you look beneath the headlines, it turns out that most of those jobs were created last year, and the private sector is now creating jobs at a much slower pace. \"The number of vacancies is down, and we've still got three regions in Britain where unemployment is... going up quite significantly. \"A year and a half after the recession ended, that's just not good enough.\" The unemployment rate fell most rapidly in Northern Ireland, down 0.8 percentage points to 7.2%, and Wales, down 0.7 percentage points to 7.9%. In both Scotland and England, the rate fell only slightly, to 7.7%. But within England there was considerable regional variation, with the North West, East and South West also all seeing more people out of work. Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development chief economist John Philpott said underlying the jobs figures was \"quite a sad story for many people and hard times still to come\". Many were trading down to find jobs, while those in work were seeing their incomes squeezed, he added. The level of cuts already seen \"indicates that the scale of public sector job cuts is going to be quite substantial, because we haven't yet had the full impact of the government spending cuts\", he said. TUC head Brendan Barber agreed that the UK labour market was \"still very fragile and a long way off the level of jobs we had before the recession\". Nonetheless, he welcomed the apparent fall in youth unemployment. The jobless rate among 16 to 24-year-olds fell from 20.7% to 19.4%, according to the ONS. Subdued wages The latest data also revealed that earnings growth slowed in the three months to April, with earnings excluding bonuses up just 2% on a year ago - its slowest rate since last August. It follows figures on Tuesday showing that the UK inflation rate remained at 4.5% in May, and is expected to rise further, implying that the real purchasing power of average wages is being steadily eroded. \"The fact that workers can't push for higher wage increases in this difficult economic environment means that real wages are going to continue to struggle,\" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. \"I think that is one factor which will act against a sharp pick up in consumer spending. And without a pick up in consumer spending, it's very difficult to see how we are going to get a major rally in [growth] going forward.\" The pound fell half a cent against the dollar following the data release, to $1.63, while the FTSE 100 index also dropped slightly. \"The market is reacting to the claimant count number and the wages data which are weaker than expected,\" said Amit Kara at UBS. Analysts say that the subdued rate of wage growth reduces the chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this year, which in turn makes the pound less attractive on currency markets.", "summary": "最新官方统计数据显示，英国今年第一季度失业人口减少了8.8万多人，是2000年以来失业人口下降幅度最大的一个季度。"}

Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe. It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease. In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children. This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died. They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain. Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues. Doctors are describing it as a \"new phenomenon\" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips. But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications. Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked. \"You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,\" she said. This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection. 'Exceptionally rare' Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home. The syndrome is \"exceptionally rare\", he said. \"This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,\" Prof Viner added. He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease \"might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic\". Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital. Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies. \"So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,\" he said. However Prof Levin said there was \"a vast amount to learn\" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks. Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases. What is the situation elsewhere in the world? There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands. At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week. Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease. All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered. The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids. In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection. Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: \"Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.\" Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children. They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).", "summary": "最近，英国和美国出现了与新冠病毒有关的罕见儿童炎症综合症病例，引起医学界关注。"}

It gave no details on income sources. The White House said publishing the tax return was against the law. Mr Trump refused to release his tax returns during the election campaign, breaking with a long-held tradition. How was it found? On Tuesday evening, MSNBC announced that it had a copy of one of Mr Trump's tax returns, dating from 2005. The details were revealed on a show later that night, anchored by journalist Rachel Maddow. MSNBC said they received the document from financial journalist and Trump biographer David Cay Johnston, who received it in the post from an anonymous source. On the programme Mr Cay Johnston confirmed he had no further details on the source, but speculated that the leak could have come from Mr Trump himself. Although leaking federal tax returns is a criminal offence, Ms Maddow argued that the network was exercising its right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the US Constitution to publish information in the public interest. On Wednesday morning, President Trump slammed Mr Cay Johnston on Twitter, and cast doubt on the claim that the papers came unsolicited through the post. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist said he and his family received threats over the report, calling it a \"disturbing sign of how Trump damages civil debate\". \"Trump fans call & harass my wife & one of my children after I break story White House confirmed. Sad! Let's have open debate, not threats,\" he tweeted. What have we learnt? The release showed Mr Trump paid the Internal Revenue Service $38m in 2005, an effective tax rate of 24%. This is higher than the average American citizen would pay but below the 27.4% averaged by higher-earning taxpayers. The bill comprises $5.3m in federal income tax and an extra $31m in what is called alternative minimum tax (AMT). AMT was set up nearly 50 years ago to stop the wealthiest people from using deductions and loopholes to avoid paying taxes. Mr Trump has called for it to be abolished. What don't we know? President Trump's critics have wanted to know more about his income tax payments, but they also want more transparency on his business ties, particularly on any links to Russia. No substantial business links have been proven. The two-page form only gives basic figures and offers no insight into the sources of his earnings. It also does not give details on any charity donations. Last October, the New York Times revealed parts of Mr Trump's 1995 tax returns that showed losses of $916m (£753m). The newspaper said this could have affected his returns for up to 18 subsequent years, allowing him to legally avoid paying federal income taxes. The forms disclosed on Tuesday do not say whether the £103m write-down that Mr Trump recorded in 2005 is connected to the losses in 1995. Why has Trump not released his tax returns? Every US presidential candidate since 1976 has released their tax returns although there is no legal requirement to do so. Throughout his presidential campaign and since his election, Mr Trump has refused to release his returns. He has said he is under audit by tax authorities and that his lawyers advise against releasing the documents. The US Internal Revenue Service has a policy not to confirm whether or not individuals are under audit, but says it does not stop anyone from releasing their own returns. Mr Trump's critics have created numerous petitions calling for their full release, including one that gathered over a million signatures. During last year's election campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton accused Mr Trump in a head-to-head debate of paying no federal income tax. He responded: \"That makes me smart.\" Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington We now have another snippet, just the smallest glimpse, into Donald Trump's personal financial empire. The few pages from 2005 reveal that the alternative minimum tax, first instituted in 1970, did what it was supposed to do - prevent a very wealthy individual from paying a relatively tiny amount of federal taxes. Beyond that, the contours of Mr Trump's personal wealth remain a mystery. Only supporting tax documentation, not included in this leak, could show the details of Mr Trump's income, including sources both domestic and international. For a few moments, the political world thought a political bombshell was about to drop on the White House. In fact, it was more like lightning at night - a quick flash, then a return to darkness. Could the Trump administration be behind the leaks? In the past, Mr Trump is alleged to have called the US media and used a pseudonym to give them favourable stories about his business dealings. Mr Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said on Twitter that he was thankful for the release as they showed his father was paying taxes.

Just down the road they were poised to begin storming the Capitol Building, demanding that the results be overturned. The white middle-aged woman holding the sign wanted that too, but because \"China is America's biggest threat,\" she told me. \"(Joe) Biden sold us out\" to Beijing and only Trump can \"protect us,\" she said, before segueing into a tale about a new world order dominated by China, shored up by eugenics and dark intentions to merge humans with artificial intelligence. I thought it a remarkable example of how the pandemic, which originated in China, had fed into the thicket of right-wing conspiracy theories that animated the crowd. Despite her concerns about President Biden, though, there is rare bipartisan conviction that China is a unique threat. Biden and Xi - Round Two It's true that Biden was the tip of the spear for Barack Obama's policy of engagement with China, as vice-president investing in a relationship with his then counterpart Xi Jinping. But his \"old friend\" Xi has since become a leader criticised in the US for a brand of personal authoritarianism, and Biden has excoriated his government for \"coercive and unfair\" trade practices. This month the new Secretary of State Antony Blinken described China as \"the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to seriously challenge the stable and open international system.\" So a high-level meeting in Alaska on Thursday will be the first chance for the administration to show how it intends to handle what Blinken called \"the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century.\" He and the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will sit down with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. 'Straight talk' and 'Strength' What do they hope to achieve? This is not being billed as meeting for reaching agreements. It's a meeting for \"straight talk\" to set the ground rules for the relationship. Already the Americans have signalled their approach. The new mantra in Washington is to engage China \"from a position of strength.\" First, the face-to-face encounter will be a low-key, one-off affair. Traditionally the secretary of state visits Japan, South Korea and China on his or her big trips to Asia. This week only Tokyo and Seoul were on the itinerary for Blinken's inaugural international foray. China is relegated to a stopover on the way back. And the meeting will be on American soil: that was extremely important, said a senior administration official. The idea is to counter the Chinese perception that the United States is on the decline, says Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Chinese commentators like to say that the \"winds are blowing to the East.\" The financial crisis of 2008, the Capitol Hill riot of 2021 and the years of Trump's unilateralism in between have reinforced a view in China that the US has been weakened inside and out. \"This meeting in Alaska is geared to show the Chinese are wrong on all three counts,\" says Green. \"The schoolyard version of this is to say: \"You're not so great…yeah you're big, but we like hanging out with our allies, democracies, because they're cool.\" Alliances are certainly the bedrock of the strategy. President Biden and his top national security officials deliberately met their counterparts from Asia's major powers - India, Australia, Japan and South Korea - virtually or in person, in the weeks leading up to Alaska. Another aim is to project inner strength. The \"first order of business,\" said a second senior US official, will be to \"explain domestic priorities\" in terms of combatting the Coronavirus and reviving the Covid-hit economy. The next is also to show that the US - and the administration - is internally unified around the idea that the relationship is a strategic competition. That's why for the first time the secretary of state and national security advisor are meeting their counterparts together. And they can point to pending legislation that's taking shape in the senate as a bipartisan effort to curb China's global influence. What will follow is a long list of concerns, including China's treatment of Uighur Muslims, its quashing of democracy in Hong Kong, its militaristic posture in the South China Sea, and its economic \"misbehaviour.\" Areas of potential cooperation are also expected to be raised, such as combatting climate change, ending the war in Afghanistan, containing pandemics, as well as dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons and Iran's nuclear programme. \"We want a robust and frank conversation with a power that's a main competitor\" said a third US official. \"We don't want them to be operating under illusions about our tough approach and we want our guys to hear from them.\" China looks for a reset The Chinese are looking for a reset after relations hit rock bottom under Trump. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that Beijing is ready to reopen \"constructive dialogue.\" But he's also urged Washington to remove Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, to stop \"suppressing\" the Chinese tech sector, and to stop \"smearing\" the ruling Communist Party. And he's warned the US to stop interfering in Beijing's internal affairs, a reference to policies in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan that are redlines for the Chinese. The Biden administration has dropped Trump's confrontational and erratic approach but maintained many of his policies, and it is wary about the shift in tone China is seeking. \"We're looking for deeds, not words,\" said the first US official, mentioning an end to \"economic coercion\" against allies such as Australia as a specific demand before the US China relationship could take steps forward. \"But our expectations are realistic,\" she added. \"It's more understanding over time how do we shape that behaviour change that we seek.\" 'An historic and fundamental debate' One change on the American side is an end to the cold war rhetoric used by top Trump officials, who focused on what they saw as the irredeemable nature of the Chinese Communist Party. But President Biden does continue to frame the relationship in ideological, rather than primarily economic, terms. \"I believe we are in the midst of an historic and fundamental debate about the future direction of our world\" he wrote in his interim national security strategy, citing the competition between democracy and autocracy. This is a break from the Obama era, but not a complete one. \"I'm sure Blinken wants to give (the Chinese) a message to take back that can be built on,\" says Green. \"Not an olive branch, but a clear picture of what's happening. And the opportunity down the road to work on issues. That's really the biggest difference…that piece Trump would never have done.\"", "summary": "今年1月，在特朗普在白宫外举行的大型“停止偷窃”（Stop the Steal）集会上，我发现一个有点偏离主题的标语：“中国支持拜登。”"}

China reported its weakest economic expansion in 28 years in 2018, and growth is expected to slow further. Already, a number of multinationals have said sluggish growth in China has affected their bottom line. The manufacturing data was up slightly from the 49.4 level recorded in December. Marcel Thieliant, economist at Capital Economics, said while the PMI didn't weaken any further in January, \"it still suggests that the economy lost momentum at the start of the year\". Other data, such as consumer sentiment and retail sales figures, also point to weakening demand in the world's second largest economy. Several international companies have warned on China's slowdown, including Apple. The tech giant blamed a 5% fall in revenues partly on China. Shares of industrial equipment giant Caterpillar took a beating earlier this week, after the company reported its sales slipped 4%, largely due to slow sales in China. Chipmaker Nvidia also reported softer sales due to a sluggish Chinese market. 3M, which makes products from adhesive tapes to air filters, also said weak customer demand in China affected its bottom line. China has been attempting to reform its economy to rely more on domestic consumption instead of exports and investment to fuel growth. The US-China trade war is also creating economic uncertainty. The latest figures come as officials from both sides meet in Washington to try ease trade tensions. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement by 1 March, the US has said it will increase the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on Chinese goods worth an estimated $200bn (£154.4bn).", "summary": "最新官方公布称，反映中国产业活动活跃程度的制造业采购经理人指数（PMI）连续两个月回升。"}

They've invested their entire lives in this mission,\" Rosetta's flamboyant project scientist Matt Taylor told the BBC after the landing. It's far too early to assess whether the mission has been a success - or otherwise. The probe took a decade to catch up with its target comet, travelling six billion km. Landing on one of these icy cosmic time capsules, with their meagre gravity and precarious terrain, was always going to be dicey. But it didn't help that two out of three mechanisms designed to help affix Philae to the surface failed. The probe appears to have bounced about one kilometre above the surface after first touching down. As I write, there are suggestions it may be lying at an angle, some way from the original landing zone so much time and effort was spent choosing. It may be on a slope, in the shadow of a cliff - which makes it difficult to get enough sunlight to charge its batteries. Whatever the outcome, and the science returned, there will always be questions about the costs of such missions and whether they can be justified in the current financial climate. On Twitter, Dr Taylor responded to just such a question by borrowing a catchphrase from A-Team actor Mr T: \"I pity the fool.\" Thomas Reiter, director of human spaceflight and operations at Esa, acknowledged how the top line figure of 1.4bn euros appeared. But he explained: \"If you divide it by the 20 years that the development and the mission has cost, it's about cents per European citizen per year that was contributing to this new knowledge.\" Four planes According to physicist Andrew Steele, who has calculated the costs on his website Scienceogram, the Rosetta mission cost 3.50 euros per person from 1996-2015. This works out at 0.20 euros per person per year. The same amount of money could buy four A380 planes. In the period since the mission was agreed, the Rosetta mission has created hundreds of jobs. The funding source for space missions like Rosetta comes from a subscription, paid by each of the 20 member states of the European Space Agency (Esa). In 2013, the UK paid a contribution of £240m to Esa's total budget of £3.3bn (4.2bn euros). Dr Sarah Main from the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) points to the potential benefits that basic scientific enquiry - of the sort that Rosetta represents - can yield. \"Forms of enquiry about the world around us, which we're summarising here as basic research, are vital to making changes to our society and our quality of life,\" she told BBC News. \"Whether they come as a downstream effect of the building blocks of basic research work someone else has done, or in a more deliberately applied way. You can make parallels with cancer research: you can't design a new cancer drug unless you understand the mechanisms that cause cancer in a cell.\" Dr Main cites the example of the World Wide Web, which grew out of a system designed to help particle physicists at Cern communicate more effectively. \"There are also a number of studies which assess the economic value of research in general. That's taking any type of research - as esoteric as you like - and adding it up to say: What does that deliver to the economy? \"We see significant returns on investment from government putting funds into scientific research. It directly causes the economy to grow. One study showed it caused the economy to grow by 20% three years later.\" Mission facts: Philae lander Comet 67P Can you land on a comet? 'More black swan than yellow duck' Brief encounters with comets Indeed, as Oxford University astronomer Chris Lintott put it when quizzed on BBC Newsnight earlier this year: \"The money doesn't go to the comet, the money's spent here on Earth. It goes to people, it goes on technology and it goes to industries in this country and throughout Europe.\" There is also the hope that such high profile events can inspire the young scientists and engineers of the future. A recent increase in numbers of A-level students taking physics at university was linked by some to better teaching, but others acknowledge a groundswell of popular interest in these subjects which may be fuelled by a greater profile in the media. But the Rosetta mission shouldn't be viewed as a recruiting tool alone. Thomas Reiter says the science designed to be carried out by the mission cuts to the very heart of the quest to understand where we come from. \"It's to find answers to very fundamental questions about the history of our own planet, how it evolved... If life really emerged on Earth or if it might have been brought to Earth by such comets many billion of years in the past. \"I think this is really worth it.\" Follow Paul on Twitter.", "summary": "莫妮卡·格雷迪教授（Monica Grady）对于登陆器首次成功登陆彗星做出的反应，已经很好说明了“罗塞塔”探测器（Rosetta）项目对科学家们来说意味着什么。"}

Legal funding The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (£9.6m) of its $15m target.

A statement on Munich police's Facebook page says: \"There is a suspicion that the 16-year-old is a possible tacit accomplice to the attack.\" The statement goes on to say that the youth reported to police immediately after the shooting on Friday, and was interviewed as somebody with a connection to the attacker. But in the course of the interviews, they discovered discrepancies in his statements. They say they are now investigating him on suspicion of failing to report a planned crime. The investigations will have to show to what extent he was responsible for a Facebook post inviting people to meet at a cinema complex near the main railway station in Munich. The attacker himself had put up a Facebook post before his attack, inviting people to come to the fast food restaurant where the shooting began. 'Not specifically targeted' Seven of the dead in Friday's shooting at the Olympia shopping centre were were teenagers - two Turks, two Germans, a Hungarian, a Greek and a Kosovan. A further 35 people were injured, but only four of them have bullet wounds - many were hurt while fleeing the scene. The state government officials told a news conference that the victims of the attack had not been specifically targeted and were not classmates of the gunman. Also they did not include three youths allegedly involved in bullying Sonboly when he was at school. Video games Robert Heimberger, head of Bavaria's criminal police, said the gunman had been planning the attack since he paid a visit last year to the town of Winnenden - the scene of a previous school shooting in 2009 - and took photographs. He said it was likely the Glock pistol - which had been reactivated - was bought on the \"dark net\" market, an area accessible only with the use of special software. It had been a theatre prop. Sonboly was said to be a keen player of \"first-person shooter\" video games. Mr Heimberger added that the parents of the gunman remained in shock and were not able to be interviewed. He also said police had not found the manifesto of Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik when they searched the gunman's room at his parents' flat. A day earlier, officials had raised the possibility of a link to Breivik, whose own attack was carried out five years earlier to the day. As to Sonboly's state of mind, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutors' office told the news conference that the gunman had spent two months as an inpatient at a mental care facility in 2015 and was afterwards treated as an outpatient. \"The suspect had fears of contact with others\" and also depression, Thomas Steinkraus-Koch said. However, there was no evidence of any political motivation. Senior German politicians have called for tighter controls on the sale of guns in the wake of the shooting at the Olympia shopping centre.

Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. \"Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection,\" said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. \"The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity.\" He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was \"very concerning\" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. \"Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. \"It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection.\" Follow James on Twitter", "summary": "美国一名男子两次感染新冠病毒，其医生称，第二次感染情况更危险。"}

She has since quit, as have the academy's head and four other members. The academy says it will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. The scandal is the biggest to hit the prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Apart from six years during the world wars, there has been only one year when the prize was not awarded. No worthy winner was found in 1935. This year's other Nobel prizes will go ahead as usual. What did the academy say? In a statement on its website, the academy said: \"The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy.\" It said that the academy's \"operative practices need to be evolved\", including tackling its statutes, conflict-of-interest issues and management of information. Some academy members had argued that the prize should proceed to protect the tradition, but others said the institution was in no state to present the award. The #MeToo campaign, which showed the prevalence of sexual assault globally, may have played a part in the academy's decision. It would have been difficult for potential winners to accept the prize with the academy in such turmoil. Academy faces struggle to regain reputation Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm This is an unusual but not entirely unexpected decision here in Sweden where internal spats between members and former members of the Swedish Academy have been headline news for months. The institution has faced deep criticism from the academic community with hundreds of professors, lecturers and researchers signing a number of letters calling for the academy to take action to restore its credibility. But this is a scandal that's also captured wider attention. Many Swedes are fiercely proud of the Nobel prizes and the fact that they live in a country that usually champions women's rights. Seeing the prestigious literature award committee unravel off the back of the mishandling of sexual assault allegations has been a bitter pill to swallow. Not everyone is confident the academy will regain its reputation in time for next year's prize announcements. What sparked the crisis? Divisions started to emerge last November when French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural project with funding from the Swedish Academy, was accused by 18 women of sexual assault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. Mr Arnault denies the allegations. The organisation later voted against removing Mr Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its committee. This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, divided the organisation. What followed was a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius. Only 11 members are now in place. Of those, one, Kerstin Ekman, has been inactive since 1989, when the academy refused to condemn the fatwa issued over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. The academy's statutes require a quorum of 12 to vote in any new members. Technically, members are appointed for life to the Swedish Academy and cannot resign, although they can refuse to take part. Academy patron King Carl XVI Gustaf has said he will change the rules to allow them to quit formally. So what happens next? The academy said: \"Work on the selection of a laureate is at an advanced stage and will continue as usual in the months ahead but the Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work, before the next Literature Prize winner is declared.\" Two prizes for literature will be announced next year, one for 2018 and one for 2019.

He described his ordeal in an interview with the BBC's Alice Muthengi, calling for more survivors to come forward. \"I hid that I was a male rape survivor. I couldn't open up - it's a taboo,\" he said. \"As a man, I can't cry. People will tell you that you are a coward, you are weak, you are stupid.\" The rape took place when men attacked Stephen's home in Beni, a city in north-eastern DR Congo. \"They killed my father. Three men raped me, and they said: 'You are a man, how are you going to say you were raped?' \"It's a weapon they use to make you silent.\" After fleeing to Uganda in 2011, Stephen got medical help - but only after a physiotherapist treating him for a back problem realised there was more to his injuries. He was taken to see a doctor treating survivors of sexual violence, where he was the only man in the ward. \"I felt undermined. I was in a land I didn't belong to, having to explain to the doctor how it happened. That was my fear.\" Stephen was able to get counselling through the Refugee Law Project, an NGO in Uganda's capital, Kampala, where he was one of six men speaking about their ordeal. But they're far from being the only ones. Police not an option The Refugee Law Project, which has investigated male rape in DR Congo, has also published a report on sexual violence among South Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda. It found that more than 20% of women reported being raped - compared to just 4% of men. \"The main reason that fewer men come forward is that people assume they should be invulnerable, they should fight back. They have allowed it so they must be homosexual,\" Dr Chris Dolan, director of the organisation, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. Legal challenges pose a problem when it comes to men reporting rape, he added. \"In the Rome Statute [which established the International Criminal Court] you have a definition of rape that is wide enough to include women and men, but in most domestic legislation, the definition of rape involves the penetration of the vagina by the penis. That means if a man comes forward, they'll be told it wasn't rape, it was sexual assault. \"There's the problem of criminalisation of same-sex activity - it revolves around penetration of the male body, not around consent or lack of consent.\" In 2016, Uganda took in more refugees than any other country in the world, and has been praised for having some of the world's most welcoming policies towards them. But for male rape survivors like Stephen, life there can be tough. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda, and going to the police to report rape is not always an option. \"When I asked the police, they said that if it has anything to do with penetration between a man and a man, it is gay,\" he said. \"If it happens to a woman, we listen to them, treat them, care and listen to them - give them a voice. But what happens to men?\"", "summary": "\"如果我谈论这件事，我会被隔离，即使那些爱我的人，也再不会与我握手了。\""}

He says it was a watershed moment, that's made him and many of his peers question their future in the city. Speaking to the BBC under condition of anonymity, directors at some of the biggest international banks and law firms said they are seeing their business in Hong Kong shrink as the protests continue to escalate. Financial services make up a fifth of Hong Kong's economy and people come from all over the world to live and work here. Its large expatriate community is attracted by the low taxes, well-paid jobs, stability and high standards of living. However, the lure of prosperity and stability in the East Asian hub has been undermined substantially since Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests, backing increased democracy and opposing the actions of the police. Panic button This last week where violence has intensified has made many firms reconsider the safety of their staff in the city. One hedge fund manager has even been given a panic button app in case of an emergency and plans are in place with his work to evacuate him and his family to another major city \"if we were in danger they have a team of people who would get us out\". A banker at HSBC says only half of their staff came in to the office on Friday as people are encouraged to work remotely if they can't get in safely. Staff are kept closely informed about the situation on the ground according to a BNP Paribas employee \"We get regular emails early in the morning and through the day from the business continuity management team - telling us whether it's safe to go into offices - and whether we should go home early.\" 'Pro-protester or pro-police' Anecdotally, the political pressure from the Chinese government on banks and law firms is also growing - and it's putting pressure on staff. Some partners in law firms are being asked to pin their colours to the mast and state whether they support the protesters or the Chinese government before winning business from Chinese firms. Firms are under pressure to keep a lid on their staff speaking in public about their views. One lawyer explains \"I've been on calls where people are asked to verbally communicate restraint and caution when sharing their views. Given the amount of people we employ here, it's a minor miracle nothing has happened\". In the workplace, people are making informal rules not to discuss the subject within their teams because emotions are running so high. \"Clearly it's the only topic of conversation in the office, but opinions are so split,\" one banker says. \"In my team of nine, three are Chinese and two are Hong Kong Chinese and the rest are expats - it's a bit like Brexit - we all have violently different views.\" A video on social media of a man who claims to work at Citigroup being arrested by police has been widely shared in the banking community. \"This has scared people here - it makes you feel we could all get caught up in this\" A spokesperson for the US-headquartered banking group said: \"We are investigating this incident and while investigations continue it would be inappropriate to comment further\". Losing business to Singapore One of the biggest concerns for financial firms is the impact all of this is having on the economy as its reputation for stability unravels. A source at one of the world's biggest international banks says it expects its Hong Kong revenue to be down by 25% in the last quarter of their financial year as a result of the violence. Many banks are now reviewing their investment plans in Hong Kong over the next few years \"If we're still talking about this in six months time, people will start giving up on Hong Kong\" They are concerned that people who are planning major deals will now turn to banks and law firms in Singapore because, in the words of one, \"it has a more predictable medium-term outlook\". So far most of the business impact has been on small companies - restaurants for example. There is concern amongst bankers, borne out in recent economic statistics, that this could spread more widely. \"The classic company we deal with would be lending money to a Chinese shipping company that does its financial transactions through HK. They rely on a healthy business environment in Hong Kong. Now we worry they will go bankrupt\".", "summary": "汇丰银行的一位交易员说：“我几次碰上发催泪弹，但还从来没有在我办公室外碰上，当时我出门去吃午餐。”"}

Reactions ranged from deeply personal expressions of pain and disgust, to pleas for forgiveness from the fan base of the vlogger (video blogger) - and criticism from fellow YouTube moneymakers. Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul (no relation) called the YouTuber \"pure trash\" in an emotional post that referenced his millions of young fans. YouTuber Zoe London shared similar concerns, tweeting: \"I can't even imagine some of the conversations some parents have had to have with worried or frightened and upset kids all over the world.\" She then posted the phone numbers for organisations offering advice and support for people in emotional distress. Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner re-tweeted a similar post to her 1.6 million followers. Some Twitter users shared their experiences of losing loved ones to suicide, saying there was no defence for Paul's intrusive video. Though the dead man was not identified and his face was blurred, the footage included close-up shots of his corpse. In the video, one of the group with Paul is heard to say he \"doesn't feel good\", before the vlogger asks him: \"What, you never stand next to a dead guy?\", and laughs. In his apology, Paul stated that he had \"never faced criticism like this before, because I've never made a mistake like this before\". He said he had \"intended to raise awareness for suicide prevention\". The video, uploaded on 31 December, garnered millions of views and well over 500,000 \"likes\" before it was taken down. Many who encountered the apology post took issue with the word \"mistake\". \"How is any of this a mistake?\" tweeted one. \"He edited this and had plenty of time to change his mind about uploading it.\" Others said the fact that Paul would not profit financially from the video didn't excuse posting it in the first place. Logan Paul's YouTube channel has 15 million subscribers, and some of them were determined to fight his corner online as the controversy raged. Several said he deserved to be forgiven. \"He made a mistake and corrected it in the best possible way he could, he is a positive human being,\" one tweeter argued. But if Paul expected support from fellow social media celebrities, it was notably absent. Grayson Dolan, a teenaged social media star with 5.1 million Twitter followers, said Paul should simply have known better. Many of those who enjoy YouTube vlogs are young - often in their teens or even below - and potentially impressionable. PewDiePie, a YouTube big-hitter with 54 million subscribers, tweeted his condemnation in a style used online to mock stupid behaviour. The millionaire vlogger, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, was forced to apologise himself last September when he used an offensive racist slur while live-streaming himself playing a video game. It followed an earlier row which saw him accused of using Nazi references and anti-Semitic imagery. \"I do strongly believe that you can joke about anything, but I also believe that there is a right way and not the best way to joke about things,\" Kjellberg said at the time.

Meanwhile, data from the fertility regulator shows a 10th of IVF cycles are dependent on donated sperm or eggs. And a third of procedures using donated material were for same-sex couples or single women. The number of UK-based sperm donors has been increasing since 2004. However, demand has increased even faster. Denmark and the United States have become major suppliers of sperm to British women. Banking The Department of Health has given £77,000 to fund a national sperm bank which will be based at Birmingham Women's Hospital. There will be a corresponding campaign to \"change the face\" of sperm donation, which will be run by the National Gamete Donation Trust. Sperm donors in the UK are mostly white, which leaves people from other ethnicities struggling to find a donor. The project will start in Birmingham before being extending to cover the whole country. Dr Sue Avery, the director of the Birmingham Women's Fertility Centre, told the BBC News website: \"The idea of the campaign is to focus on sperm donation as a tremendously positive thing to do and that the men who do this are very special. \"They're helping to build families. \"We're spending this money to start something that we hope will grow to the point where nobody has to import sperm.\" Eventually the national bank could act like a \"brokerage house\" that connects donors in one part of the country with those in need elsewhere. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said the proportion of imported donor sperm was increasing every year. \"In part this is because the time and resources needed to recruit UK donors can sometimes make importation more viable,\" the body said. People who need donated sperm included men who have had cancer treatment or had a genetic defect leaving them incapable of producing sperm. The HFEA data also shows a rising number of women who are single or who have a female partner receiving treatment with donated sperm. Growing problem Dr Allan Pacey, the chair of the British Fertility Society, told the BBC: \"We are importing as a nation more and more sperm from overseas, without being xenophobic it kind of just doesn't feel right, it's a problem that's not going away.\" He argued simple economics could make it easier to import sperm than increase the number of donors. But said the practice created problems such as making it much harder for children to meet their biological parents if they lived half a world away. \"Also I think there will always be some patients who, with regards to sperm donors, will want an individual that is more closely related to them in culture and language and outlook.\" He added that sperm donation needed to become more ethnically diverse and it made sense to start the bank in multicultural Birmingham. Jimmy, a 22-year old sperm donor from Coventry I've gone to the Birmingham clinic about twice a month for the past nine months. I initially started doing it because I had a friend who was struggling to have children and it made me want to help. I want to help other people, some who really go through it. I just think why not? Obviously you are concerned but I have faith if someone has gone through this to have children they will go to the effort to make sure they have a good life. I don't think of [babies conceived from my sperm] as my children as I think the parent is the person who brings them up. I don't feel an emotional bond [to the children]. At my age now I don't know I would be a good parent. Why choose Birmingham? Laura Witjens, the chief executive of the National Gamete Donor Trust, said: \"When people think of sperm donation they often only think about the physical act of producing sperm. \"Let's face it that can be off-putting and detract from the real issues. We're all set to change that outlook. \"Sperm donors are very special men who are doing something they and their families can be exceptionally proud of. \"These are men who are doing something life-changing for themselves and for others.

Both leaders stressed the countries' shared economic goals and co-operation at a joint news conference. But their responses to questions about Syrian refugees underscored their contrasting policies on immigration. Mr Trump defended his controversial travel ban, saying he wanted \"to have a big beautiful, open door\", but that \"we cannot let the wrong people in\". The US president has stirred controversy for issuing an executive order temporarily banning entry of all refugees and visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries. A federal judge has issued a temporary nationwide block on the travel ban, but the issue of refugees appeared to overshadow the joint news conference. Mr Trudeau said the US and Canada had always been strong allies, fighting alongside one another on various battlefields. \"But there are times when we have differed in our approaches. And that's always been done firmly and respectfully,\" he said. Balancing act - Analysis by Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Justin Trudeau had a fine line to walk on Monday and came through with his best diplomatic balancing act. The prime minister can travel back to Ottawa with Mr Trump on the record as having called the trade relationship between the two nations \"outstanding\" and only in need of a \"tweaking\". What those tweaks might entail is still to be revealed, but you could almost hear anxious Canadian businesspeople breathing a sigh of relief. This first face-to-face meeting also offered a clue at how far Mr Trudeau was willing to go preserve those vital trade ties. Mr Trudeau refused to bite when the press repeatedly baited him to criticise his host on thorny issues like immigration, though many of his own policies stand as a reproach to those of the new US president. Read more from Jessica The prime minister added that Canada continues to \"pursue our policies of openness\" without compromising security and would serve as a \"positive example in the world\". The Canadian leader made global headlines for accepting nearly 40,000 refugees, and has said his country will welcome those fleeing persecution and war. US refugee ban: Canada's Justin Trudeau takes a stand When Mr Trump signed the controversial order, Mr Trudeau tweeted his government's commitment to bringing in \"those fleeing persecution, terror & war\". He also sent a pointed tweet that showed him greeting a young refugee at a Canadian airport in 2015. \"This is a delicate situation here I don't think it would help anyone in this country if the prime minister went to the US and started a fight,\" said Opposition Conservative leader Rona Ambrose. The two men, however, emphasised their commitment to provide growth and jobs for people on both sides of the northern border. \"We will co-ordinate closely to protect jobs in our hemisphere and to keep wealth in our continent,\" said Mr Trump. Mr Trudeau gave Mr Trump a framed photograph of the US president and the prime minister's father, Pierre Trudeau. The picture was taken in 1981 when the then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau received an award in New York City, according to the prime minister's office. The US president's pledge to renegotiate free trade deal Nafta has reportedly unsettled Canadian officials - 75% of the country's exports go to the US. The two leaders, and Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, also led a roundtable discussion on female workers. The neighbouring countries launched a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. Ivanka Trump, who appealed to working women throughout her father's presidential campaign, helped secure female executives to participate and set the agenda for the meeting. The joint task force may help allay tensions over some of the protectionist measures Mr Trump has issued since he took office in January. US migrants flee to Canadian border It was a cold that Seidu Mohammed and Razak Iyal could barely comprehend. On Christmas Eve, they found themselves struggling through a waist-deep field of snow in a rash night-time bid to sneak across the Canada-US border. The two men had met a just few hours before at a Minneapolis bus station and both faced deportation back to Ghana after being denied refugee status in the US. They had heard through a network of other refugees and African expats that if they could get into Canada, they had a second shot at asylum in the north. By the time they reached Highway 75 in Manitoba, their hands had frozen into claws. They could not reach the phones in their pockets to dial 9-1-1 as planned. Mohammed's eyes had frozen shut.

'Two great nations' Other issues likely to be discussed include North Korea and climate change. It is not clear whether they will include human rights in Hong Kong. Mrs May, who will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, is travelling at the head of a 50-strong business delegation, including BP and Jaguar Land Rover, as well as small firms and universities including Manchester and Liverpool.

She said she expected China to play a \"huge role\" in the economic development of the world, adding: \"I want that future to work for Britain, which is why, during my visit, I'll be deepening co-operation with China on key global and economic issues that are critical to our businesses, to our people, and to what the UK stands for.\" She acknowledged that her agenda \"will not be delivered in one visit: it must be our shared objective over the coming years\".

But asked whether the UK had achieved its aim of becoming China's closest partner in the West, he replied: \"Co-operation can always be bettered. As to whether China and Britain have become the closest partners, we may need to wait and see how Prime Minister May's visit this time plays out.\" In recent years, both countries have hailed a \"golden era\" in UK-Sino relations. China has signalled its desire to invest in high-profile UK infrastructure projects, including the building of a new nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point - although its involvement has raised some national security concerns. British trade with China has increased by 60% since 2010 and UK ministers are expected to use the trip to stress that the UK will remain an \"excellent place to do business\" after it leaves the EU next year. The UK has said it will prioritise negotiating free trade agreements with major trading partners such as the United States, Australia and Canada after it leaves the EU in March 2019. Earlier this year, the UK said it would not rule out becoming a member of the Trans Pacific Partnership free-trade zone, whose members include Japan, South Korea and Vietnam and which is considered by many as a counter-weight to Chinese influence in the region. Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has urged Mrs May to use the visit to privately raise what he says has been the steady erosion of freedoms and rights in the former British colony in recent years. Hong Kong is supposed to have distinct legal autonomy under the terms of its handover to China in 1997.

The former strongman has become, at 92, the world's oldest elected leader. He came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protege Najib Razak. His historic win ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957. What other policies did he outline? Dr Mahathir took his oath of office before the king, Sultan Muhammad V. The new prime minister was accompanied by his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohammed Ali. Addressing the media, he pledged that Malaysia would remain a \"friendly trading nation\" and he would work to keep the currency, the ringgit, as \"steady as possible\". He said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in a corruption scandal at 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund set up by Mr Najib. \"We believe that we can get most of the 1MDB money back,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, adding: \"We have to increase the confidence of investors in the administration.\" He renewed his promise to seek to have his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, released and pardoned. When Dr Mahathir was previously in power, Anwar was jailed for corruption and sodomy after calling for economic and political reforms. He was released in 2004 but jailed again under Mr Najib in 2015. He is currently due for release next month. What was the scale of the victory? Investment analyst Aninda Mitra told Reuters news agency the shock of the election outcome had been as great as \"Brexit and the Trump election\". Official results show Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats. Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption had weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition. How are people taking Mahathir's return? \"We feel so united tonight,\" student Abdul Aziz Hamzah, 24, told AFP news agency in the crowd of jubilant supporters outside the palace. \"Mahathir is so insightful and experienced because he's been here before.\" Fahmi Fadzil, an MP from the winning coalition, told the BBC Dr Mahathir inspired excitement about Malaysia's future. \"Today he has created, along with other Pakatan Harapan leaders, a resurgence in faith in Malaysia,\" he said. \"The polling centres that I visited, there was a sense of euphoria among people who cast their vote. Members of the press that I had met, some of them said that they cried when they heard that we had won. \"There is very real change happening in Malaysia. Finally we can believe in the country again.\" You may also be interested in: Oldest winger in town going strong at 95 Remarkable life of Japan's centenarian doctor How are Mahathir's earlier years in office remembered? He was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003. Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. However, he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents. Where did Najib fall down? Dr Mahathir was also a mentor to Mr Najib, who became prime minister in 2008. But Mr Najib was accused of pocketing some $700m (£520m) from the 1MDB but vehemently denied the allegations and was cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund, meanwhile, is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib was also accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their posts. Those allegations led to Dr Mahathir's surprise defection in 2016 from BN to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was \"embarrassed\" to be associated \"with a party that is seen as supporting corruption\". Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again. But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. 'Mountain of challenges' By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent This morning Malaysia has woken to an entirely new situation, the first transfer of power in its history, albeit to a very familiar leader. But there are huge unknowns. How willingly will BN, the coalition which has, in various forms, run the country since independence and embedded itself into all areas of governance, relinquish power? How well will a disparate coalition, united largely by their desire to oust Najib Razak, work together in government?

She said she believed \"research will find sugar is addictive\", and that \"we may need to introduce a sugar tax\". The food industry said it was working on reducing sugar in products. Speaking to the health select committee, Dame Sally said: \"We have a generation of children who, because they're overweight and their lack of activity, may well not live as long as my generation. \"They will be the first generation that live less, and that is of great concern.\" Education urged She said being overweight had been \"normalised\", adding: \"I worry that we have re-sized a women's dress size so that a size 14 now was a size 12 when I was student. \"We have to find a new way - not of ostracising people who are obese and making them feel bad about themselves - but somehow of helping them to understand this is pathological and will cause them harm.\" She said she thought researchers would find that sugars were addictive, and the public needed to have \"a big education\" over how \"calorie packed\" some smoothies, fruit juices and carbonated drinks were. She said: \"People need to know one's fine, but not lots of them. \"We may need to move towards some form of sugar tax, but I hope we don't have to.\" Earlier this year, doctors called for a soft drinks tax to reduce sugar intake. 'Voluntary pledges' The charity Sustain, which advises the government on the food and farming industry, says the UK consumes more than 5,727 million litres of sugary soft drinks a year. Adding a 20p tax for every litre sold would raise more than £1.1bn. The Department of Health already has a \"responsibility deal\", which is a series of voluntary pledges by industry designed to tackle issues such as obesity. Much of the focus of those pledges is on reducing salt and calorie count rather than sugar per se. And ministers are also pushing ahead with front-of-pack labelling, which includes information about sugar, but again, this will be voluntary. Front-and-back labelling will include a combination of colour coding and nutritional information that will be used to show how much fat, salt and sugar and how many calories are in each product. A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"To help the nation to be healthier by eating fewer calories, including sugar, we are working with industry through the Responsibility Deal. \"This work has already delivered results but we have always been clear that, if food and drink companies fail to act, we will look at other options and are keeping all international evidence under review.\" Terry Jones, of the Food and Drink Federation, said any extra tax on sugar would \"hit the poorest families hardest at a time when they can least afford it.\" Sugar content was already clearly labelled among products' ingredients, Mr Jones said. He said: \"Food and drink producers in the UK have taken action to reduce salt and saturated fat in the diet, in line with robust evidence linking excessive consumption of these nutrients with a negative impact on health.\" Prof Barry Everitt, Professor of Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, said pinning down whether sugar was actually addictive was a complex matter. He said sugar - and fats - did impact on the chemistry of the brain's reward circuits - but in a much smaller way than drugs such as cocaine. He said: \"The important issue is that some individuals lose control over their food, especially sugar (and junk or fat-rich) food. This small sub-group might, then be viewed as 'addicted', but it may also be discovered that the loss of control in this sub-group might have a predisposing condition. \"The message that 'we'd better watch out for this sugar stuff is misleading', as far as I am concerned, because it suggests if you eat it you risk becoming addicted and the evidence does not support that.\"", "summary": "英格兰首席医疗官员说，可能必须要对糖加税来降低人口中的肥胖率。"}

The Queen was told of Prince George's name when she met him for the first time on Wednesday. The family are at the Middleton home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, after spending a night at Kensington Palace. George was the bookmakers' favourite for the first name of the prince. The duke and duchess had been expected to pick a traditional royal name for their son, who was born at St Mary's Hospital in London, weighing 8lbs 6oz. Royal infants usually have historical names which are passed down through the generations. There have been six King Georges up to now, most recently the Queen's father, although his first name was Albert and he was known to his family as Bertie. The name Louis is Prince William's fourth name and is likely to be a tribute to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle and the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947. Prince Charles was immensely fond of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. Known by the Royal Family as Uncle Dickie, he was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979. The prince's other middle name - Alexander - is one that three medieval Scottish kings have had, and was also the name of the famous 4th Century ruler Alexander the Great. The Queen's middle name is Alexandra. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said George will be seen as a tribute to the Queen's father but the couple are said to genuinely like the name themselves. Alexander was a favourite of Catherine's, he added. The BBC's Peter Hunt said Prince George does not have to be King George if he accedes to the throne - he can choose another name, as the Queen's father did. \"Royal names are diminishing. Edward VIII had 7; Prince Charles has 4; Prince William 4; Prince George 3. #princegeorge,\" he tweeted. Charles Mosley, author of Blood Royal, told the BBC he knew it would be George. \"It was the name of the sovereigns under whom this country became a world player - in the 19th Century, defeating Napoleon, and in the 20th Century, winning two world wars. \"Louis is a nod in the direction of the Mountbatten element in the Royal Family. And indeed the surname of the royal family is still Mountbatten. His (Prince George's) birth certificate and marriage certificate will say Mountbatten-Windsor.\" As well as being an established regal name, George is also a saint's name. St George was an early Christian martyr and is the patron saint of England. The announcement of the new prince's name has been relatively quick compared with previous royal babies. It was seven days before the name of a newborn Prince William was announced in 1982, and there was a wait of a month following Prince Charles's birth in 1948. The Queen spent 30 minutes with her new great-grandson on Wednesday. At a reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening, the monarch said she was \"thrilled\" at the arrival of her third great-grandchild. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, and Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, paid visits to the hospital on Tuesday afternoon. Later that day, Catherine's sister Pippa Middleton went to Kensington Palace and Prince Harry also paid his new nephew a visit. The duke and duchess left Kensington Palace shortly after the Queen's visit and were driven to Bucklebury. It had been expected that the couple would want to spend time at the duchess's family home but it is not known how long they will stay. Prince William has two weeks' paternity leave before he is due back to work in Anglesey where he is an RAF search and rescue pilot.", "summary": "剑桥公爵夫妇威廉和凯特给他们刚出生的儿子起名为乔治·亚历山大·路易(George Alexander Louis)。"}

Indonesian police said there were burn marks on the asylum-seekers and that they were trying to find out more. Australia's government and navy said there was no basis for the claims. Speaking in Washington, Foreign Minister Julia Bishop said: \"I reject utterly any notion that the Australian government would condone that sort of behaviour and I cannot imagine for a moment that the professional people that we have in our forces would have behaved in that fashion.\" \"Of course if there is any co-operation we can extend to ensure that these allegations are scotched then we'd be prepared to do it.\" Vice Admiral Ray Griggs said on his Twitter account: \"Based on everything I know there is no basis to these allegations.\" 'Inexcusable' The reports emerged after asylum-seekers told Australian broadcaster ABC that they were beaten by navy personnel, and burned after being forced to hold onto the boat's engine, as their boat was being towed to Indonesia in early January. Indonesia serves as a transit point for people-smugglers, who ferry people to Christmas Island, the closest part of Australian territory, on rickety boats. Footage posted on the ABC website showed asylum-seekers being treated for burns. Indonesian police said that some asylum-seekers had burn marks on their hands. \"They showed the marks of what they said were inflicted upon them by [the] Australian navy - but we don't know for sure because the only witnesses are among themselves,\" detective Sam Kawengian told ABC. Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said that asylum-seekers had \"strong motivations for seeking to discredit the activities of Australia's border protection operations\". Navy and customs officials said that the burns were probably self-inflicted, or occurred when asylum-seekers tried to fix the boat motor, The Australian reported. Prime Minister Tony Abbott also said he trusted the navy. \"Who do you believe? Do you believe Australian naval personnel or do you believe people who were attempting to break Australian law?\" he told reporters. However, Christine Milne, leader of the Greens party, said: \"When allegations are made they need to be investigated.\" \"It is just inexcusable to stand there and say 'I have every confidence, therefore I'm not going to look into it'.\" The row comes amid reports Australia's navy have been pushing boats carrying asylum-seekers back to Indonesia. Last week, Australia apologised to Indonesia for incursions by its military into Indonesian waters. It said the violations happened \"inadvertently\" during operations to stop asylum-seekers.", "summary": "澳大利亚政府驳斥了有关海军虐待难民庇护申请者的报道，但表示愿意就有关事件与印尼当局进行合作。"}

Defence ministry officials say the 65,000-tonne ship is \"the most complex warship ever built in the UK\". The estimated cost of the aircraft carrier and its sister ship is £6.2bn. The initial projected cost was £3.65bn. Building HMS Queen Elizabeth and the second carrier, the Prince of Wales, has been one of the biggest defence projects ever undertaken in the UK. It has been beset by construction and design delays however. During the course of the project, an order for carrier jump jets - capable of short take-offs and vertical landings - was switched to jets with a longer range that could carry more weapons. But the MoD later decided to revert to the original jets for logistical and financial reasons. Labour's Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said last year that the \"U-turn\" involved £74m of taxpayers' money going \"down the drain\". The ship will be named in a traditional champagne ceremony. Members of HMS Queen Elizabeth's crew, and workers who have helped to build the ship, will be among thousands of people expected to attend. The construction of the aircraft carrier has sustained about 7,000 jobs at more than 100 companies across the country, the MoD said, describing it as \"Britain's biggest-ever carrier\". Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"This will be a proud and historic day, not just for the Royal Navy but for the entire nation. \"It is great news that Her Majesty will officially name the first aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth.\" War fighting credibility He added: \"This occasion will mark a major milestone in regenerating the UK's aircraft carrier fleet and its power projection capability.\" Later in July, the dock at Rosyth will be flooded to allow HMS Queen Elizabeth to float for the first time. Sea trials will then begin in 2017 with flight trials of Lightning II aircraft starting the following year. Admiral Sir George Zambellas, First Sea Lord, said the ship would be the \"first of a class that will return fast jet carrier operations to our nation's war-fighting credibility\". He said: \"We have a great journey ahead, in close partnership with the Royal Air Force, to create and sustain the best that our shipbuilding, engineering, technology and people can deliver. \"And we are proud to have the chance to show what we can do.\" Contracts 'renegotiated' Work is already under way on HMS Queen Elizabeth's sister ship, the Prince of Wales, which will start to be assembled in Rosyth dockyard later this year. The MoD said the defence secretary last year renegotiated contracts to ensure the costs of the \"biggest ever ships in the history of the Royal Navy\" did not spiral. \"The defence secretary announced a successful renegotiation of contracts between the MoD and industry last year, to prevent further cost increases and save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds,\" a spokesperson said. \"This ensures any further cost increase is shared equally with industry and provides an incentive to manage this vast project efficiently and effectively.\"", "summary": "英国国防部透露，英国女王将在7月4日举行的仪式上正式为皇家海军的新航空母舰“伊丽莎白女王”号命名。"}

His company Intco has been around for 25 years. He told me the stolen download included \"our technology information, our customer list, our purchasing and supply information. Everything.\" Intco is a business that makes medical devices, skirting boards and photo frames. I visited its offices at a business park in Shanghai, and a factory that sits either side of a tree-lined road south of the city. The company recycles polystyrene waste sent to China from all over the world. Then, using heat moulding and imprinting techniques, it turns it into an array of products which end up on the floors of houses in Brazil or Russia, or hanging on walls displaying photos in the US and Britain. \"We actually have the record of how he stole it,\" Mr Liu told me. \"He just sold it to establish another company, as his investment.\" Mr Liu feels he has no recourse. He told me he went to the police but nothing happened. He said he still intends to pursue it. His story is increasingly common here, for both local businesses and foreign firms. Top officials from the US and China will hold their next round of trade talks this week and protecting intellectual property (IP) is a key demand for Washington. They argue American and other foreign companies in China have endured decades of theft and infringement. Reacting to pressure China has taken some steps to address the problem. The country only established copyright laws in the 1980s, but things have progressed relatively quickly since then. China now has specialist IP courts, albeit - like every aspect of the judicial system - subservient to the ruling Communist Party. They are supposed to settle cases within 12 to 18 months. Their creation was not due solely to outside pressure from foreign firms. Chinese business figures like Mr Liu have also called for the country's legal system to better protect the innovators and entrepreneurs who have turned China into much more than the \"copycat\" economy it was once labelled. Benjamin Qiu, an IP lawyer with US law firm Loeb & Loeb, told me that the Chinese are now just as litigious as foreign firms. Foreign firms are just as likely to win a case - a good case, Mr Qiu added - as domestic plaintiffs. In the past few years Lego and New Balance have both won high-profile cases against copycat manufacturers. There is no doubt that the trade war with the US has sped up the pace of reform in China. President Xi Jinping recently led lawmakers, at their annual gathering in Beijing, in approving new rules for foreign investors. The Foreign Investment Law states that the transfer of technology from foreign investors to any domestic partner must be voluntary. China has always defended this highly contentious practice by insisting it's part of an agreed commercial arrangement. The new law also bars government officials from passing on details of foreign investors IP. A new era? Now though comes the hard part - enforcement. Mr Qiu told me the next step is \"detailed regulation coming out after this law, and we want to see actual cases in local courts and also from enforcement agencies.\" If that follows, then he thinks \"potentially the foreign IP owners will have more to protect [them] in China.\" Both the EU and American Chambers of Commerce welcomed the new law, but both also criticised what they said was ambiguity in the legislation. The Americans also had concerns that it was rushed through without proper consultation. Many foreign companies have been stung over the years in China. Most have found the lure of the massive market, or what was once rock bottom labour costs, irresistible. Some though feel the risk is too high. A fruit industry executive recently told me his firm wanted to buy new conveyor belts for their farms in China, but the European manufacturers said no. They feared their systems would be copied here, and they'd be wiped out. Mr Liu can't do that. He is Chinese and wants to stay in China. But he has taken steps to try to prevent another IP theft. He is chief executive of the company he founded, but this year he told me he's changing his title to include head of research and development. Because he can't trust anyone else with the firms' commercial secrets. Protecting original ideas, techniques and information in China - \"it's a human right\" he told me.", "summary": "没有破门而入的迹象，没有人被绑架。没有玻璃被打碎。但这家位于上海郊区的工厂却因为知识产权盗窃遭受损失。"}

Kylie Jenner - who when the series started was just nine-years-old - is now 21 and a billionaire. With an estimated fortune of $1bn (£760m), according to Forbes magazine, the make-up mogul is by far the wealthiest member of the ubiquitous Kardashian clan, which is led by matriarch and \"momager\" Kris Jenner. However, the rest of her siblings aren't exactly scrabbling around the back of the sofa for loose change. Kim Kardashian West is a multi-millionaire thanks to her own beauty line, perfumes and her \"kimojis\"; Kendall Jenner is an international fashion model; Khloe Kardashian has her own jeans business Good American and eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian has benefitted from product endorsements and collaborations with fashion retailers. Blurring the personal and the professional coupled with their astonishing reach on social media platforms has proved lucrative. The sisters' combined following totals 537 million, allowing them to squeeze millions of dollars from exploiting pop culture. Alexander McKelvie, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, also believes the show is carefully scripted. \"If you were to analyse the show, you would think it is very spontaneous,\" he said. \"But it is most likely scripted and planned and very curated to provide a clear and compelling message about what the producers and the Kardashian family want to have revealed about them.\" How have the Kardashians made their millions? This season of Keeping up with the Kardashians is focused squarely on a \"scandal\" involving Khloe Kardashian, her former partner Tristan Thompson and an alleged \"hook-up\" with Kylie Jenner's best friend, Jordyn Woods. In the show, Khloe laments: \"It just sucks it had to be so public. I'm not just a TV show. Like, this is my life.\" Around the time the alleged tryst emerged, the price of the Jordy Lip Kit, which was a liquid lipstick and lip pencil that was part of a wider collaboration between Kylie and Jordyn, was discounted by 50%. It soon sold out. In an interview with The New York Times, Kylie Jenner said she didn't know the price has been cut, adding: \"I would never do something like that\". But the fact is, the scandal shifted units. \"Essentially, their entire lives are on display the entire time and I think that it does make them appear more relatable to certain consumers,\" said Alison Gaither, beauty analyst at market research company Mintel. In that first episode, audiences also see Khloe at a photo shoot for her jeans company, Kim and Kylie discussing a perfume collaboration and Kim's husband, the rapper Kanye West, getting in on the act by talking about his own projects. Coinciding with all this was the launch of Kourtney Kardashian's own lifestyle blog Poosh - a bit like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop website but with considerably more flesh on display. Like most things Kardashian, Poosh was announced via Kourtney's Instagram account, as was Khloe's jeans business last year, and the social media platform was central to the success of Kylie's cosmetics business. Ms Gaither said: \"What they've done the best is really leverage their social media following to create a brand that their followers actually want, especially when we think of Kylie Jenner.\" When Kylie first launched her lip kits back in November 2015, she was able to market to millions of fans directly through her Instagram account which meant she was able to dispense with the cost of marketing and get an instant reaction on what people did or didn't like. Lewis Sheats, assistant vice provost of entrepreneurship at North Carolina State University, said: \"If you think 20 years ago for an entrepreneur to get feedback from 20 customers they might actually have to invite them in or build a product and get it in their hands or stand on a street corner and survey them. \"On a social media platform, they can reach hundreds of thousands of people within seconds and get feedback on a concept.\" Have the Kardashians always made money? Some of the deals that the family struck in the early days of their fame, in particular involving older siblings Kourtney, Kim and Khloe, haven't always been smooth-sailing. The sisters became the faces of a make-up brand called Khroma Beauty through a licensing agreement. But after launching in 2012, the line was soon pulled from stores amid copyright infringement claims. It rebranded as Kardashian Beauty, but even then the legal problems continued. It was only very recently that the family was able to extricate itself from the situation. They also launched the Kardashian Kard, a pre-paid credit card aimed at teenagers and parents who wanted to track their spending. It was soon scrapped, however, after Connecticut's former attorney general Richard Blumenthal said he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the card's high fees \"combined with its appeal to financially unsophisticated young adults\". Even now, not everything they touch turns to gold. Kendall Jenner's stint as the face of Pepsi collapsed in a storm of anger after she starred in an advert that some claimed trivialised the Black Lives Matter movement. Pepsi pulled the advert the day after it aired. Mum of three (soon to be four) Kim Kardashian West provoked the ire of the US Food and Drug Administration when she promoted an anti-morning sickness medicine. And members of the family have garnered significant backlash for taking money to promote weight loss products. Ex-Radio 1 presenter Jameela Jamil, who has a campaign around body positivity, described Kim Kardashian West as a \"terrible and toxic influence on young girls\". Where next for the family? The family's current television contract runs until this year and at this stage it isn't clear if the series will continue. Viewing figures for the last season of the show waned as the 1.3 million who tuned in for the premiere dropped to 851,000 by the end of its run. If the programme is nearing its end, would the family still have the same degree of success without it? \"They would certainly not get as much free advertising,\" said Professor McKelvie. \"But they've been successful in finding other ways to remain in the media by creating fake conflicts, whether they are self-made or not, that is free advertising.\"", "summary": "美国一档真人秀节目《与卡戴珊同行》（Keeping Up with the Kardashians）最新的第16季开播，不仅意味着卡戴珊一家的日常喜怒哀乐将再次一览无余地展示给观众，而且也意味着卡戴珊姐妹的各种商品也将再次吸引顾客的眼线。"}

She posted a picture of herself sitting in a restaurant four hours before going to the museum with a friend, describing how first one official then another stared at her breasts but did not say which rule she was contravening.

A guard then arrived citing museum rules, she says. \"At no time does anyone say my cleavage is a problem, they're manifestly staring at my breasts, referring to them as 'that'.\" Initially she refused to put on her jacket. \"I don't want to put on my jacket as I feel beaten, compelled, I'm ashamed.

A free thinker, who led the campaign to unseat Commons Speaker Michael Martin in the last Parliament, Mr Carswell has never hidden his disdain for the \"job for life\" culture among some MPs in safe seats and the \"cosy cliques\" that dominate decision-making in government. Most newly-elected MPs put their head down and get on with the job of climbing Westminster's greasy pole. But the Clacton MP, who entered the Commons in 2005, refused to play the game from the start, speaking openly of his \"revulsion\" at the system and how, frankly, he was embarrassed to be an MP. EU relationship In his book, The Plan, co-authored with Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, he set out 28 steps to \"renew our broken democracy\" and \"get our supine, spineless Parliament off its knees\". He had high hopes that David Cameron, whom he backed in the 2005 Tory leadership contest, would push through some of their proposed reforms - such as open primaries, where all voters in a constituency get to choose party candidates, and giving voters the power to recall their MP if they are doing a bad job. But in February this year he was, along with other maverick backbench Tories, bitterly disappointed to see plans for recall powers dropped by the coalition. He told BBC News: \"This government could have been different, but I think this marks the moment at which it becomes just another administration.\" This - together with his belief that the Conservatives were not truly committed to changing Britain's relationship with the EU - undoubtedly fed into his decision to jump ship to UKIP. Mr Carswell has long agitated for a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU - an institution he views as being profoundly undemocratic and lacking in accountability. He is an ardent believer in the power of the internet to revolutionise the way we are governed - by smashing open closed institutions such as the EU and handing direct democratic control to the public. He set out some of these ideas in his 2012 book, The End of Politics and the Birth of iDemocracy. In December 2009, he introduced a bill before the House of Commons requesting a public referendum on the UK's EU membership. And in his first week after being re-elected at the 2010 general election, he revealed he intended to force a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Among his rebellions, Mr Carswell tabled an amendment expressing concern over the increase in the EU budget in October 2010. 'Undermining democracy' Born in 1971, Mr Carswell spent his early years living in Uganda, where his parents worked as doctors in a local hospital. He was educated at the University of East Anglia and King's College London, and worked in digital television, investment management and the Conservative Party policy unit - run by David Cameron - before becoming an MP. He is married to Clementine and has a daughter. In his spare time, he has said he enjoys swimming, running, gardening as well as making quince jelly. Mr Carswell reportedly owns a £655 love seat in deep moss brushed cotton while his father was the inspiration for James McAvoy's character in the Last King Of Scotland, the British doctor who went to work in Uganda and found himself working for Idi Amin. Mr Carswell first stood for Parliament in 2001, taking on Tony Blair as the Tory candidate for Sedgefield. Despite apologising for coming second he still managed to cut Mr Blair's majority by more than 7,500 votes. In 2005 he was elected as MP for Harwich, defeating Labour's candidate by just 920 votes. By 2010 he defeated the same opponent by 12,000 votes - although boundary changes had seen the seat renamed Clacton. During that contest UKIP did not field a candidate, supporting what they saw as the re-election of a kindred spirit. Mr Carswell went on to gain a reputation as an outspoken Tory moderniser, influencing initiatives such as David Cameron's Big Society and campaigning for the reform of parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal. He once told the BBC he was attracted to politics because \"our democracy is being undermined, with remote and unaccountable elites making the key decisions that affect our lives\". Adding to his other accolades, the MP revealed on Twitter in January that he had brought down a suspected shoplifter in his constituency. \"You probably don't want to hear this, but I'm your local MP,\" he reportedly told the individual. Mr Carswell's bold announcement may not have been out of character, but he said the decision to leave the Conservative Party has given him sleepless nights. He has vowed to fight on for \"fundamental change in British politics\" - something he now believes only UKIP can deliver. In the by-election on 9 October, Mr Carswell won 60% of the total number of votes cast, and secured a majority of 12,404.

Downing Street says there is still no timetable for a vote on extending UK military action but it is thought it could happen before Christmas. PM David Cameron dismissed suggestions action depends on UN authorisation. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, he said that while a United Nations security council resolution was welcome, he believed it was not necessary and he would not \"outsource to Russian veto\" decisions about Britain's safety. Labour urged Mr Cameron to seek a UN resolution. It comes after he promised a \"comprehensive strategy\" to win MPs' backing for bombing IS in Syria - in the wake of Friday's Paris attacks. Paris attacks: Live updates Rethinking strategy on IS 'Going to war' Ministers believe around 20 Conservative MPs are still unlikely to support air strikes but that others have changed their minds since the government lost a vote on intervention in the Syrian conflict in 2013. The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said the government increasingly believes it can call on the support of enough Labour MPs, as well as other parties such as the DUP, to get parliamentary approval and that a senior cabinet minister had told the BBC \"we're going to war\". In other recent developments: Analysis by Deputy Political Editor James Landale I have been told that this afternoon Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has been briefing Labour MPs alongside one of his top military aides, Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger, the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) who commanded British forces in Helmand. Mr Fallon is also planning to brief Labour MPs collectively at an open meeting in a couple of weeks' time, followed by another briefing for Tory MPs. And while Downing Street is still insisting that there is no guarantee there will be any vote over military action, that the prime minister will act only if he is absolutely certain of winning that vote, ministers believe the momentum is moving their way. Read more from James In 2013, MPs voted against UK military action against President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, but later approved British participation in air strikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq. Earlier this month, the influential Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee urged Mr Cameron not to join the coalition bombing IS in Syria. However, following the Paris attacks linked to IS militants, the prime minister said the case for UK action had been strengthened. He said he would set out a \"full spectrum\" approach to taking on IS in Syria, including military action, counter-terrorism, humanitarian support and strategies for \"defeating the poisonous narrative of extremism\". Mr Cameron has previously promised British involvement would not be extended without Parliament's consent and said he would hold another vote only when he was sure of a \"consensus\" among MPs. The BBC's Ross Hawkins says that while plenty of MPs think a vote before Christmas is likely, Downing Street has dismissed the reports of a timetable as speculation. 'Moral issue' Labour's shadow foreign secretary Hillary Benn said: \"We want to see there being a UN Security Council resolution, which is why we are calling - Jeremy Corbyn and I - are calling on the prime minister to go and seek such a resolution.\" Labour leader Mr Corbyn said on Tuesday that any military response should have the support of the international community and the UN, but he has faced criticism from many of his own MPs for his refusal to back further UK involvement in Syria. Labour MP John Woodcock told the BBC on Wednesday he believed a \"significant number\" from his party would support strikes, himself included, once they had seen a broader plan. The SNP has said it is opposed to military action without a specific UN mandate while the Lib Dems could also insist on similar conditions. Meanwhile, former chief of the defence staff Lord Richards told BBC Radio 4 there was already a strategy to take on IS, but it was \"too slow and ponderous\" and the involvement of RAF Tornados in Syria could help give it \"oomph\". \"Those eight aircraft, although they are old, are actually very capable,\" he said. He continued: \"There is [also] a moral issue... there are tens of millions of people in the region, particularly in Syria, who are begging for help and it's in our interests to do so too.\"", "summary": "英国政府官员向BBC透露，政府目前非常有信心，议会将会批准向叙利亚境内伊斯兰国（IS）目标发动空袭的军事行动。"}

Hungary has accused Croatia of breaking international law by not registering migrants - one minister reportedly calling Mr Milanovic \"pathetic\". Croatia says more than 20,000 migrants have entered since Wednesday. Some 8,000 passed into Hungary on Friday, the Hungarian authorities said. New busloads arrived at the Beremend border crossing on Saturday, with the migrants offloaded and transferred to Hungarian buses. Hungary is then transporting the migrants to Austria. Austrian police said 6,700 had crossed since midnight, 4,200 at Heiligenkreuz, near the city of Graz, and the remainder at Nickelsdorf near Vienna. Croatia's response has typified the EU confusion over how to handle the crisis - migrants were initially welcomed to travel through the country, but then borders were hastily closed to regulate the flow as the government said numbers had become untenable. In Hungary, migrants have at times been met with tear gas and water cannon as they try to push their way north. In Slovenia police used pepper spray on one group. Most of the migrants, many fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa, want to go to Germany or the Scandinavian countries. The EU is to hold emergency talks next week.

Crisis in graphics In other developments: 'People smuggling' Croatia says some border crossings remain open but that it has been forced to close others because of the sheer volume of migrants. It says the weight of numbers - particularly since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia - means its only option is to allow the migrants to pass through, and has called for a unified EU response. \"There has not been an agreement with Hungary,\" Mr Milanovic told reporters. \"We forced them, by sending people up there. And we'll keep doing it,\" he said in the north-eastern town of Beli Manastir, from where buses and trains packed with migrants were sent north to Hungary on Friday. Mr Milanovic said the migrants \"want to leave the country, so this is the only way, for us to let them pass through in a civilised way\". He also blamed Greece and Turkey for failing to prevent migrants crossing into Europe by sea. Hungary again lashed out at Croatia on Saturday. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said: \"Instead of honestly making provision for the immigrants, it sent them straight to Hungary. What kind of European solidarity is this?\" Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs accused Croatia of \"intentional participation in people smuggling\". Hungary said Croatia had broken international laws by not registering the migrants. However, the BBC spoke to a number of migrants who had reached Austria via Hungary who said they had not been registered in Hungary either, simply driven in buses across the country and told to walk over a railway line into Austria. Slovenia has accused Croatia of breaking the rules of both the EU and the Schengen free movement area. EU meeting Hungary has taken a tough line on the influx, and on Saturday called up army reservists to assist. It enacted tough laws this week after erecting a razor-wire fence along its Serbian border, making it a criminal offence to cross it. It says it will impose the same conditions once the fence along its Croatian border is completed soon. Asylum seekers want to reach Hungary and Slovenia, which are in the Schengen zone, en route to more prosperous northern European countries - with Germany the favourite destination. The EU has been strongly criticised for its failure to co-ordinate a response. Interior ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday in another attempt to agree on relocating migrants with binding quotas for each state. The next day, EU leaders will hold an extraordinary summit on migration. Migrant crisis in Europe: Key dates A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a \"promising start\". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and \"other separation issues\". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided \"sufficient progress has been made\" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the \"row of the summer\" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's \"weakness\" and insisted it was \"completely consistent\" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. \"It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,\" he said. Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to \"assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions\". \"I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,\" he said. \"It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. \"Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. \"I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind.\" Who is in charge? Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called \"parallelism versus sequentialism\" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a \"total cave-in\". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the \"row of the summer\". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a \"fair deal\" was possible \"and far better than no deal\". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. \"We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,\" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of \"senior experts\" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was \"much common ground\". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be \"invisible\". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was reassured that economic considerations were \"top of the pile\" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. \"I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. \"I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,\" Mr Martin said.

But how has their relationship developed? The couple met through mutual friends in London in July 2016 when one of Ms Markle's close friends, Markus Anderson, reportedly introduced her to the prince. Mr Anderson, who sat next to Ms Markle at the Invictus Games, is linked with private members club Soho House - of which Harry is a member. But it wasn't until months after the initial London meeting that the press managed to get news of their blossoming romance. The Sunday Express was the first paper to reveal the 36-year-old was Prince Harry's new girlfriend with the news featuring on the front page last October. In the days after it broke, the pair went to a Halloween party where the prince reportedly donned a mask and went trick-or-treating. Press 'abuse and harass' Meghan In November 2016, the prince officially confirmed he was dating the US actress. In a statement from Kensington Palace, he also took the opportunity to condemn Ms Markle's treatment by the press. He referred to a \"smear\" on the front page of a national newspaper, racial undertones in comment pieces and \"outright sexism and racism\" from online trolls. There had been a \"bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life\", the prince said. He was worried about her safety and was \"deeply disappointed\" to not have been able to protect her. Digital editor of OK! Online Kelby McNally says the statement came as a \"surprise\" because their relationship hadn't been officially confirmed. \"This is proof that the younger generation of royals are moving away from some of the stereotypical stiff-upper lip royal behaviour,\" she says. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy, said it showed Harry's \"strong desire to both protect her and hang onto her\". The Duke of Cambridge signed off Harry's plea to the press agreeing the situation had gone too far. Prince William \"understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him\", a statement from Kensington Palace said. In mid-November of that year, Ms Markle was photographed out and about in Kensington doing some shopping in the high street, with the press suggesting she had been staying at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, where the prince lives. Talk turns to honeymoons Despite the couple trying to keep a lid on their affairs, a cheeky comment during a royal tour put the prince firmly back in the limelight. While on a 15-day trip to the West Indies later that month, Harry was made the offer to honeymoon in Antigua by the country's prime minister. In front of hundreds of guests, Gaston Browne said: \"I am told that there may be a princess and I just want to say that should you make the decision to honeymoon - then Antigua and Barbuda want to welcome you.\" The PM continued to stress the honeymoon credentials of his country but the prince didn't seem to respond to the invitation. In December the couple were gearing up for their first Christmas together. But where would they spend it - at Ms Markle's home in Toronto or London? The pair chose the latter to carry out their first festive tradition. They were pictured by the tabloids reportedly buying a £65 Nordmann Fir at the Pine and Needles store in Battersea Park, London. Actress Ms Markle was seen as a \"far cry\" from the prince's previous girlfriends which made their story all the more compelling, Ms McNally says. \"I think people are intrigued to see if much will change for her - after all, she is dating a real-life prince. Will she carry on her acting career as normal? Will they reside in the UK or the US?\" Later that month, the couple were pictured for the first time on a trip to London's West End. Prince Harry and Ms Markle were snapped strolling hand-in-hand before watching the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Gielgud Theatre. New year, next milestone. According to reports, they went on their first holiday together in January 2017. For their trip, the prince reportedly took Ms Markle to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, Norway after spending New Year together. The pair are thought to have stayed in a cabin for seven days where they went whale-watching and spent time on the nearby lake. In March the prince took Ms Markle as his plus one to one of his best friend's weddings in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher at the ceremony. Fast forward to May and Ms Markle was pictured at a polo match supporting her boyfriend. She was seen smiling and clapping as she watched Prince Harry play at Coworth Park, Berkshire. They didn't seem to hide their affections for one another as the prince kissed Ms Markle before the event, which he went on to win. It was one of several matches Princes Harry and William have played for charity. Wedding bells... but not theirs While all eyes were on Pippa Middleton's summer wedding many were intrigued to see if Ms Markle would attend and really be part of the family. Ms Middleton married financier boyfriend James Matthews in May at a ceremony in Englefield, Berkshire where crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dress, the royals and to see if Harry's girlfriend would turn up. She didn't attend the ceremony, but was snapped arriving for the evening reception with the prince fuelling more speculation about the couple's romance. In late August, the couple went on a three-week holiday to Africa to celebrate Meghan's 36th birthday and on their return Vanity Fair magazine declared Ms Markle was \"wild about Harry\". In an interview with the magazine she revealed they had been together for six months before the rest of the world found out. The actress said she had hoped people would understand \"this is our time\". \"We're two people who are really happy and in love. \"This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\" Not hiding any more In September, the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event set up by Harry for injured soldiers. They sat separately at the opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada but were then pictured together as they arrived for the wheelchair tennis event a few days later. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple strolling hand-in-hand and press rushed to capture the moment. Ms Markle's mother was also photographed with them at the closing ceremony of the games. The Daily Mirror's Royal Correspondent, Victoria Murphy said their relaxed appearance shows they were \"keen to present themselves to the world as a couple\". \"Were they 10 years younger it may be a case of 'wait and see', but they are two people in their mid-30s who know what they want from life - and who they want to share it with. \"It seems the public won't have to wait long for another royal wedding.\"", "summary": "哈里王子和未婚妻、美国人梅根·马克尔将于2018年5月完婚。婚后两人将住在伦敦的肯辛顿宫，梅根将加入英国籍。"}

BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt tweeted that royal officials said the next 12 months would be \"transitional\" for Prince William. He will not become a \"full time royal\" at this stage, they said. Conservation work The duke, with the Duchess of Cambridge, will continue to support the work of the Queen and the Royal Family through a programme of official engagements - both at home and overseas, the palace added. He plans to expand his work in the field of conservation, particularly in respect of endangered species, through the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The foundation has partnered with seven of the world's most influential conservation organisations under United for Wildlife, a long-term commitment to preserve the world's natural resources. Prince William said: \"The threats to our natural heritage are extensive, but I believe that this collaboration of the best minds in conservation will provide the impetus for a renewed commitment and action to protect endangered species and habitats for future generations. \"At the root of the illegal wildlife trade, for example, is the demand for products that require the deaths of tens of thousands of these animals every year, pushing them further towards extinction. \"We must work together to prevent this catastrophe and allow our children the opportunity to experience wildlife in its many beautiful and varied forms.\" The duke recorded two public messages in London on Thursday focusing on reducing demand for rhino horn and ivory. They will air globally later this year. The duke and duchess attended the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards at the Royal Society in London on Thursday evening. In a speech to guests, Prince William started by joking about spending his first night away from baby son Prince George. \"As you might have gathered, Catherine and I have recently become proud parents - of a baby who has a voice to match any lion's roar,\" he said. \"This is actually our first evening out without him, so please excuse us if you see us nervously casting cheeky glances at our mobile phones to check all is well back home. The duke continued: \"Like any new parents, our thoughts inevitably turn to the world that our child will inherit. \"It is unfathomable to imagine a world in which children who have been born in the past couple of months may grow up in a world in which rhinoceros have ceased to exist in the wild.\" 'Immensely special' The palace said the duke was considering a number of options for public service and will make a further announcement in due course. Tuesday's final RAF shift brought to an end a three-year posting on Anglesey for the prince. In an interview for the BBC Wales documentary Helicopter Rescue, he said: \"There's no greater feeling than when you've actually done some good and saved someone's life. \"I don't think there's any greater calling in life... to be able to see a son or daughter's face when you bring their mother or father back from the edge of death - it's quite powerful.\" The head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford, praised the duke's work in the air force. Sir Andrew said Flight Lieutenant Wales had been an \"integral\" part of the RAF's search and rescue force, \"often in the most demanding of conditions, [he] has contributed directly to saving lives in the mountains of North Wales and from the ravages of the Irish Sea. He added: \"He has earned the respect of all who have worked with him as a highly professional and competent pilot.\" In a speech at the Anglesey Show in August, the duke thanked the island's people for being so welcoming to him and his wife. \"I know that I speak for Catherine when I say that I have never in my life known somewhere as beautiful and as welcoming as Anglesey,\" he said. \"I know that both of us will miss it terribly when my search and rescue tour of duty comes to an end next month and we have to move elsewhere. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for making my wife and me so welcome when we arrived here, as you do thousands of visitors each year.\" He said the island had been their first home together and would always be an \"immensely special place for us both\". Though their main home will be the newly refurbished Kensington Palace, the royal couple are also expected to take up their country retreat Anmer Hall on the Queen's private Sandringham estate in Norfolk later this year.", "summary": "英国肯辛顿宫宣布，在服役超过7年之后，威廉王子将从军中退伍。"}

The right-wing nationalist particularly opposes immigration by Muslims. Hungary's population is falling by 32,000 a year. Women there have fewer children than the EU average. As part of the measures, young couples will be offered interest-free loans of 10m forint (£27,400; $36,000), to be cancelled once they have three children. Mr Orban said that \"for the West\", the answer to falling birth rates in Europe was immigration: \"For every missing child, there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine. \"Hungarian people think differently,\" he said. \"We do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children.\" While Mr Orban was delivering his state of the nation address, the latest demonstrations were being held in Budapest against his government's policies. About 2,000 people gathered in front of his office, while others blocked one of the main bridges across the Danube river. Correspondents say the biggest applause during Mr Orban's speech was for his announcement of a seven-point plan to increase the birth rate. Other points in the government's plan include: Mr Orban finished his speech with: \"Long live Hungary and long live the Hungarians!\" The average number of children a Hungarian woman will have in her lifetime (fertility rate) is 1.45. This puts the country below the EU average of 1.58. In 2016, France had the highest fertility rate in the EU - 1.92 children per woman - and Spain and Italy had the lowest at 1.34, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reports. Niger, in West Africa, has the highest fertility rate in the world, with 7.24 children per woman. Increasing birth rate 'very difficult' The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest writes: Critics of the government say its package and pro-family policy so far target well-off families and ignore the Hungarian poor, including an estimated 750,000 Roma (Gypsies). Tax relief does little to help families who pay little tax anyway. Housing subsidies of €35,000 (£30,666) were offered to families able to invest a similar sum of their own - but few Roma have such savings. The nationalist Fidesz government has cut welfare payments and reduced the number of months those made unemployed can claim for. The population has been falling steadily, from a peak of 10.7 million in 1980, to below 9.7 million today. About 600,000 Hungarians have moved to western Europe in the past decade - it is impossible to calculate how many will return. \"Increasing the number of births is very difficult, because we have less and less women of child-bearing age,\" State Secretary for Families Katalin Novak told the BBC. That number is set to fall by 20% in the next decade. \"So less and less women need to have more and more babies.\" The government's new package, she emphasised, is based on the number of babies couples would actually like to have, and then to encourage them with financial help. The aim is to increase the fertility rate to 2.1 by 2030. How do other countries help mothers? Many other countries with relatively low birth rates have introduced extra payments and other benefits for mothers. Russia's birth rate has been declining for decades: the population fell from 149m in 1991 to 140m in 2018, and the median age has risen from 33 to 39. So, to help the poorest families, in March 2018 the government announced monthly payments of 10-11,000 roubles (£118-£130; $152-$167) until their first child reached 18 months old. A poor family also gets a one-off payment of 300,000 roubles for each additional child born. Serbia, one of Hungary's neighbours, has one of the world's fastest-shrinking populations. It has seven million people and a median age of 43. Last March it announced that new mothers would get a one-off payment worth £740 ($956) for their first child, monthly payments of £74 ($96) for the second child for two years, and further payments for three or more children. The birth rate in Italy is among Europe's lowest, along with Cyprus and Spain. Italy gives mothers an allowance of €80 per month (£70; $90) for each child born. The poorest families get a monthly allowance of €160 per child. In Germany more babies were born in 2016 than in any year since 1996. But Germany has also put more incentives in place for couples to have children. Parents have a legal right to a nursery place once their child is one year old. Germany has a new law, the \"Good KiTa Act\", granting lower childcare fees for parents who cannot afford the full price, and a fee exemption for parents who receive a child allowance and housing benefits. Low birth rates are also worrying governments in East Asia. The marriage rate in South Korea is at its lowest since records began - 5.5 per 1,000 people, compared with 9.2 in 1970 - and very few children are born outside marriage. According to World Bank data for 2016, just a few countries, including Singapore and Moldova, have a fertility rate as low as South Korea's - 1.2 per woman. The replacement rate - the number needed for a population to remain level - is 2.1. Fertility rates are also low in China (1.6) and Japan (1.4).", "summary": "匈牙利总理欧尔班（Viktor Orban）最近宣布了一项旨在鼓励生育的政策：生四个以上孩子的母亲可终生免交个人所得税。"}

Researchers for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu) analysed how much students who applied to higher education in 2006, earned last year. Jane Artess, of Hecsu, said pay distribution was \"strikingly uneven\". This was despite laws designed to ensure equal access to jobs and pay, said Ms Artess, The researchers analysed data from a longitudinal study of 17,000 recent graduates called Futuretrack. They found that the take-home pay of more than half of female graduates ranged between £15,000 and £23,999. Male lead Men were more likely to take home £24,000 and above, they found. The analysis did not include part-time workers or the unemployed. The data, published in the Hecsu journal Graduate Market Trends, suggested men earned more than women across all degree subject areas, even if more women took those subjects than men. \"When graduate earnings are examined by subject, it is clear that women earned less than men who studied the same subject,\" says the article. The authors add this is the case across all subject areas, \"even where women's participation is greater than men's\". \"Equal opportunity to access jobs and pay has been enshrined in legislation for 40 years, yet Futuretrack found that being female can make a difference to a graduate's earning power\", said Ms Artess. \"It is difficult to see why this is, for example, female graduates of media-related subjects are no more or less numerous than their male counterparts yet their earnings are typically lower. \"Of the Futuretrack respondents, there were fewer men than women in law, yet there is an even greater male lead on earnings. \"Since it would be unlawful for employers to pay males and females doing the same job differently, something else must be happening to female graduate earnings. \"If we look at wages by sector, the male lead is persistent in the public and private sectors, in graduate workplaces and also in graduate and non-graduate job roles. \"The only area where female pay is equal to males is in the not-for-profit sector,\" said Ms Artess. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady described the findings as \"very alarming.\" Motherhood penalty \"We know that women pay a huge motherhood penalty, but this data suggests earnings disparities may be starting earlier. \"More women are going to university and are better educated than ever before but are not getting the same reward when they leave as male graduates. \"This research shows they are getting a raw deal for their talent.\" Heather Jackson, a businesswoman and author who advocates a better gender balance among senior managers, said the results were disappointing but unsurprising. Managers should take note that \"a raft of research published over the last decade has shown that gender diversity and the right balance of talent can be a contributing factor to business performance, so there is a strong business case to ensure that we nurture female talent from the very start of their careers\", said Ms Jackson. A government spokeswoman said that although the gender gap was closing, \"it is still too large\". \"We have already made good progress towards ending pay discrimination,\" she said. \"Measures in the Equality Act to make pay secrecy clauses unlawful have already been implemented. \"We are also encouraging companies to sign up to Think, Act, Report, a voluntary initiative to improve gender equality at work, including reporting on pay and other work-place issues. \"More than 70 companies have signed up, covering 1.3 million employees. \"But for all this, pay inequality remains a stubborn obstacle to real fairness in the work-place. \"We will continue to work with businesses to ensure that we do all we can to help them make the most of women's talents, and unlock their full potential.\" The Futuretrack project is carried out for Hecsu by Warwick University's Institute for Employment Research.", "summary": "最新报告说，女性大学毕业生工资仍然低于男性，年薪相差数千英镑。"}

The number of people out of work fell by 99,000 to 2.39 million in the three months to October, the ONS said. Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the figures showed that \"the plan is working\". Mr Cameron said: \"There should not be one ounce of complacency because we have still got work to do to get our country back to work and everyone back in work means greater stability for them, greater ability to plan for their future, greater help for their families. \"But the plan is working, let's stick at it, and get unemployment down even further.\" But Labour leader Ed Miliband, while welcoming the news, said more people are working part-time because they could not get the hours they need. This 7.4% rate compares with a figure of 7.6% for the three months to September, and is below the rate analysts had expected. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in November fell by 36,700 to 1.27 million. In Northern Ireland the unemployment rate was slightly higher at 7.5%, while Scotland's figure was 7.1.%. England and Wales matched the national figure of 7.4%. The North East of England had the highest unemployment rate, at 10.1%, while the lowest rate was 5.6% in the East of England. The North East also had the highest claimant count rate at 6.1%, compared with the South East, which had the lowest, at 2.3%. Earnings pressure Average weekly earnings growth, including bonuses, picked up by 0.9% in the three months to October compared with a year earlier, the ONS said, a slight improvement on the three months to September. Excluding bonuses, pay grew by 0.8%. But this is still well below the level of inflation - currently running at 2.1% - meaning that people's earnings are still falling in real terms. The ONS data also showed that the number of people aged 16 and over who are in work was at a record high of 30.09 million, up 250,000 compared with the May-to-July period. The percentage of the workforce in the public sector - 18.8% of those in employment, or 5.7 million people - fell to its lowest rate since the current data series began in 1999. 'Spectacular strength' Economists welcomed the latest jobs figures. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas said the UK labour market was \"showing spectacular strength\". David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"These are very strong labour market figures, which back our recent forecast of increased growth in the fourth quarter of this year.\" And Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The official data are now confirming the upbeat signals from business surveys, which have shown the fastest rates of job creation since the late 1990s in recent months, as firms respond to a marked pick up in demand.\" The Bank of England has said it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until the unemployment rate falls to 7%. But even then, governor Mark Carney has said an interest rate increase is not guaranteed. The pound jumped against both the dollar and euro after the release of the jobs figures, as expectations rose that UK rates could rise sooner than forecast The Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was unanimous in voting to keep interest rates on hold, minutes from its December meeting revealed, and to leave the central bank's £375bn programme of quantitative easing unchanged. The MPC believes inflation could fall to its target level of 2% early in 2014, the minutes show, but it is concerned that sterling's recent 2% rise against other currencies could jeopardise the UK's economic recovery.

The BBC's Disinformation Team notes Turkmenistan also alleged virus-laden dust was the reason citizens were being told to wear masks. They have denied trying to cover up an outbreak. 'Invading malicious viruses' State-controlled Korean Central Television (KCTV) broadcast special weather segments on Wednesday, warning of an influx of the yellow dust the next day. It also announced a nationwide ban on outdoor construction work. Yellow dust refers to sand from Mongolian and Chinese deserts that blows into North and South Korea at certain times of the year. It is intermingled with toxic dust that for years has raised health concerns in both countries. On Thursday, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said “all workers… must clearly recognise the danger of invading malicious viruses” in response to the dust cloud, the BBC's Disinformation Team noted. Embassies also reported receiving a warning about Pyongyang's dust concerns.

However, it also says it is extremely rare for someone to be infected this way - especially outdoors. The main way people get infected is from standing in close proximity to someone who is infected who then coughs, sneezes or talks, spreading the virus through droplets. Media in neighbouring South Korea has also dismissed the suggestion that yellow dust from China could spread Covid-19 to the North as impossible, according to NK News. Despite claiming the country has no cases of coronavirus, there are deep fears about Covid-19 in North Korea and leader Kim Jong-un has been holding high-level meetings to ensure tight restrictions remain in place.

It brings card fraud to its lowest level since 2000 when £317m was lost through fraud. The association credited the improvement to the increased use of anti-fraud measures. Among them were online card verification software, such as Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode, and the increased use of chip-and-pin technology abroad.

Recession poses no immediate threat to the biggest economies in Asia, although they are slowing down. Yet some smaller economies in the region - including Hong Kong and Singapore - are definitely at risk. They are what Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, calls the \"innocent bystanders\" in the trade fight between Washington and Beijing. \"These are small, open economies, where trade - and trade with China - is extremely important,\" says Mr Kuijs. Here's a look at what's driving the slowdown in Asia's top economies, as well as the countries at risk of recession: China Growth in the world's second-largest economy has been for easing for years. The latest figures show China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.2% in the second quarter, its slowest pace since the early 1990s. The trade war that has seen Washington impose tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods is adding more strain. It has hurt some Chinese firms, with roughly 20% of the country's exports sent to the US. But perhaps more harmful to businesses is the lack of clarity over when the long-running dispute will end. \"The one thing that is affecting business plans is the uncertainty of the US-China trade war, probably more important than the tariffs,\" says Mr Kuijs. \"The uncertainty is a major factor of [the concerns] we see globally.\" Beijing has taken a series of steps this year to support the economy, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. For 2019, the government is targeting growth of between 6% and 6.5%. Japan Mr Kuijs points out that what happens to China matters a lot to the rest of Asia. The slowdown there and the trade war have knocked business confidence in Japan, a country also grappling with softer global demand for its exports, such as electronic equipment and car parts. But its latest economic figures were fairly upbeat. Preliminary data showed GDP increased 0.4% in the second quarter - beating an expected 0.1% rise - thanks to strong consumer spending. Still, the world's third-largest economy faces a threat to spending when a long-awaited sales tax increase is introduced in October. \"Conditions probably won't remain as healthy as they are now, as domestic demand is set to weaken after the tax hike,\" Capital Economics Japan economist Marcel Thieliant says. India Over in Asia's third-largest economy, growth has faltered amid sluggish demand at home and weak investment. India's latest quarterly GDP growth dropped to a five-year low of 5.8%. The next GDP reading, due 30 August, could be weaker still. The country has relied on domestic consumption to spur its huge economy, but spending has slowed sharply. Car sales are one troubling example. In July, passenger vehicle sales plunged 31%, the steepest monthly fall in nearly two decades. The sector has slashed jobs and cut production as sales dry up. So far this year, India's central bank has cut rates four times. The benchmark rate currently sits at a near-decade low. More stimulus measures to boost the economy, which is also battling the threat of a widening trade conflict with the US, are expected this year. Hong Kong The Asian financial hub is fighting the pressures of a slowdown in China, the trade war and political unrest. Some economists expect that combination to push the territory into recession before long. Gross domestic product shrank 0.4% in the three months to June compared with the previous quarter. But those figures did not capture the impact of the pro-democracy protests that have gripped Hong Kong for more than two months, hitting tourism and retail sales. Economists at DBS and Capital Economics are among those expecting that third-quarter numbers, due out in November, will show Hong Kong has fallen into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Singapore The trade-dependent city state has been hit by weak global demand, slowing growth in China and the trade war. Singapore is reliant on high-tech exports - and softer demand for electronics around the world has darkened its economic outlook. The economy shrank by 3.3% in the second quarter, on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis. That prompted the government to cut its growth forecasts for 2019 to between 0% and 1%. Oxford Economics expects that third-quarter GDP numbers, due in October, will show a contraction, meaning that Singapore will enter a technical recession. Mr Kuijs says the impact of the trade war on Hong Kong and Singapore is \"larger than in China itself, even though no one is imposing any tariffs on these countries\". South Korea Concerns swirled earlier this year that South Korea could slip into recession. But it managed to avoid that outcome after huge government spending helped the economy swing back to growth in the second quarter. Gross domestic product grew 1.1% in the three months to June compared with the previous quarter, when South Korea posted its sharpest contraction since the global financial crisis. In July, the country's central bank cut rates for the first time in three years. Much of the pain has been caused by faltering tech exports, driven by the global electronics slowdown. That trade is crucial to South Korea, since electronics account for around 30% of the country's exports. A simmering trade battle with Japan is adding more uncertainty to South Korea's growth prospects.", "summary": "全球经济状况堪忧，对于下一次衰退的讨论也甚嚣尘上，世界各国对于就业和增长的焦虑不断扩散。"}

The day that my uncle, a lorry driver, brought me a fuzzy yellow mongrel from my grandmother's mountainous, faraway home was the happiest of my young life. I named him \"Doggie\", and we immediately became inseparable. As an only child born in 1979 at the beginning of China's one-child policy, I had always been alone, and Doggie became my best friend. He loved running around outside our one-room flat, gobbling up left-over rice and snuggling near the coal fire. But these halcyon days did not last. After just one winter, my parents told me Doggie had to go. In Chinese cities in the early 1980s owning a pet was considered highly undesirable, bourgeois behaviour. None of my neighbours had one. It was also not entirely legal. There was no access to animal vaccines or vets, so pets could pose a public health risk. One day, my mother announced we were going shopping - and when we returned a few hours later Doggie was no more. He had been strung up by the legs in our communal yard, and was soon turned into a stew, complete with herbs and hard-boiled eggs. No-one paid any attention to my tears. I heard the neighbours say I would soon forget the whole thing. They, on the other hand, were in a celebratory mood. In the years before China's economic boom, when some food was still rationed, it was rare to have the chance to feast on a whole animal. I refused to eat the stew - and I have never eaten dog in my life. In China, the tradition of dog-eating goes back far beyond written history. Along with pigs, oxen, goats, horses and fowl, dogs are one of the six animals domesticated during the Stone Age. On the other hand, it is not the kind of thing that is eaten every day. It is a speciality meat, commonly believed to confer strength, vigour and virility on the eater. How dog is eaten Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop writes: Judging by the sporadic waves of outrage about dog-eating in China, you might think it was one of the pillars of the Chinese diet. Actually, however, the consumption of dog meat is extremely marginal: it's seldom seen in markets and on restaurant menus, and most Chinese people eat it rarely, if at all. Dogs, like pigs, have been reared for their meat in China since the Neolithic age, but in modern times their flesh is regarded as a delicacy in just a few areas, such as Hunan and Guizhou. Even in these places, it tends to be eaten only occasionally, and in certain seasons. According to traditional Chinese medicine, dog is a \"heating\" meat which can offer a useful energy boost in midwinter, but is best avoided after the lunar new year. In culinary terms, dog meat is normally blanched or soaked before cooking to dispel the earthier, heavier aspects of its flavour. It is then, typically, made into slow-cooked soups and stews seasoned with ginger, spring onion, rice wine and spices, although it may also be roasted, or served cold as an appetiser. The tender meat of puppies is favoured over that of older dogs. In the course of many years of studying Chinese cuisine, I've only eaten dog meat on a handful of occasions. The first time, it reminded me of pork; the second, in a fiendishly spicy Hunanese stew, it recalled the taste of lamb. About 716 million pigs are slaughtered in the country every year, and 48 million cattle. The number of dogs slaughtered is far lower - one animal rights group puts the figure at about 10 million. But where do these dogs come from? According to some researchers, many are pets - like Doggie, except they have been stolen from their owners. As dogs were arriving for the dog-meat festival at Yulin in Guangxi province this week, Peter Li of Humane Society International saw no animals with quarantine inspection certificates to indicate they had been farmed. \"All of them can be suspected to be stolen urban pets, rural guard dogs and stray dogs and cats,\" he says. A four-year inquiry into the dog-meat industry by Animals Asia also concluded that most dogs eaten in China are stolen. \"During the entire investigation, we found no evidence of any large-scale breeding facilities, where 100-plus dogs were bred and raised,\" says the report published earlier this month. \"The difficulty of large-scale breeding of dogs for food and the greed for profit give rise to stealing, snatching from the streets and even poisoning of dogs.\" But Li says there is mounting pressure on Chinese authorities to take action against the eating of pets - and that society is turning against the idea of eating dog altogether. There were far fewer stalls selling dog and cat meat at the Yulin festival this year than in 2014, he says. \"The overall attitude is against dog eating. China has 130 million dogs, of which 27 million are urban pets. That's a big number of pet owners. \"The younger generation, born in the 1990s, is not tolerant of animal cruelty.\" In 2014, animal rights activists intercepted 18 lorries carrying dogs intended for eating, resulting in the rescue of some 8,000 animals, he says. The Chinese media often carries stories of such rescues, in which activists force vehicles to stop and pool money to purchase the animals. He dates the rise of animal protection activism in China to 2011, the same year when, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than the countryside. City dwellers, he says, view dogs and cats more as pets, rather than as working animals - guard dogs, for example - or sources of meat. In May, on a visit to Shanghai, I saw a sight that delighted me. While strolling on the Bund, I stopped a young tourist named Yang Yang who was carrying her tiny, fox-like dog in a sling on her chest, the way I normally carry my human baby. \"Oh, this way I can take him into restaurants and on airplanes,\" she explained. \"Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed in with me. Where I go, he goes.\" All three of us posed for a photo in front of Shanghai's iconic skyline. How I wish more people had taken this attitude three decades ago. My parents, now utterly embarrassed about having allowed my pet to be cooked, generally avoid the topic entirely. But when I was five years old, my father left China to study abroad and the very first gift he sent me was a fuzzy, yellowish stuffed puppy. I named him Doggie. To this day, wherever I go, he is with me.

One that is \"stealing American jobs\". He's promised to slap a 45% tax on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn't start playing fair - a move that's led to concerns over a US-China trade war. It goes both ways President Trump says his plan is good economics, and would create more jobs in the US. But many economists argue this would hurt US consumers more than it would hurt Chinese businesses. Global research house Capital Economics says American consumers may have to pay up to 10% more for Chinese-made goods if tariffs were imposed. Those goods include things like your laptop, refrigerator and mobile phone. But it's not just Chinese companies making these products. Many US firms have manufacturing bases in China and would be hit by any kind of import tariffs as well. Half of US imports from China are electronics or machines, and that includes Apple's iPhones. But what if the iPhone were to be made completely in the US, which is in theory at least, the new president's goal? At least one study says the cost of an iPhone manufactured in the US would only shoot up by 5%. But that's only if the components are still sourced overseas. Make those parts at home - and the price goes even higher, hurting profits of US firms like Apple. It's not just iPhones though. Tariffs would likely hit goods across a variety of sectors. A few other items that might be affected: Reality check But while the China-bashing may appeal to Mr Trump's voting bloc, it's \"unclear just how they [the Trump administration] would raise these tariffs they keep talking about,\" says Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre. Under US law you can only raise tariffs on the goods of other countries by up to 15%, she adds. \"They may start with slapping tariffs on specific sectors, like Chinese steel,\" Ms Elms continues. \"And that would almost certainly see retaliatory moves from the Chinese.\" Capital Economics estimates if the US stopped buying goods from China altogether, it could shave three percentage points off China's GDP. With China's economy already slowing down, this is an unthinkable scenario for Beijing. Social stability depends on economic growth. Already, China has been clear about what a trade war with the US and China could look like. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus,\" reads the state-backed Global Times editorial page. \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted.\" Plane talking Many American firms, such as Boeing, depend heavily on business from China, and there are thousands of American jobs back home tied to these businesses. Rising consumption on the mainland and the potential 1.3bn customers means China is a market that American companies cannot afford to be left out of. China's smartphone market for example, is larger than the US's and Europe's combined. Besides planes, these are some other popular US products sold in China. History lesson \"Nobody wins in a trade war\", said China's President Xi Jinping in a speech at the recent Davos forum. And if history is anything to go by, then he is right. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, the US Congress slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield US workers. It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act, named after two Republican Congressmen. Other countries retaliated with their own tariffs, a trade war ensued and global trade fell by 66%, dragging down the world economy with it. Some economists argue this made the Great Depression last much much longer than it needed to. Sometimes history, and not economics, is the best teacher.", "summary": "有人批评美国新总统特朗普在很多问题上善变，但是他在一个问题上的确始终如一，那就是中国。"}

Soon, not only were they spending double the other customers, but they were buying the high-end stuff, preferring the premium vintages. China - this top customer - has bought close to 40% of Australia's wine exports in the past few years. In 2019, China bought more bottled wine from Australia than it did from France. After an intense few years of marketing and trade deals, this love affair with Australian winegrowers was fizzing along nicely. Then last week it was corked in the neck. China slapped over 200% tariffs on bottled Australian wine, in a trade hit linked to deteriorating political relations. The one swift blow exposed again Australia's economic dependence on Beijing. 'Buy wine for democracy' Wine is just the latest Australian export this year to be collateral damage in the wider political battle. Since May, a string of goods - barley, beef, copper, sugar, lobsters, timber, coal - have been halted or otherwise sanctioned by China's Ministry of Commerce. While Beijing cites trade reasons for the blockages - accusing Australia of illegal dumping practices for its wine - analysts say it's become increasingly clear that the real motivation is political. That has spurred politicians around the world this week to release a video urging people buy Australian wine \"to stand up to China's bullying\". The #SolidarityWithAustralia campaign came from the recently formed Inter-Parliamentary Alliance of China - a group of 200 MPs from 19 countries who are known for their hawkish stances on China. The Australian senator in the video, Kimberley Kitching, argues that China has cancelled Australia's exports because of criticism on human rights. \"This isn't just an attack on Australia. This is an attack on free countries everywhere,\" she says. Collateral hit For local wine-growers, the overnight closure of their biggest and richest market is a devastating blow. The tariffs at minimum will triple the cost of an Australian bottle for Chinese buyers. What was once a $100 shiraz might now cost at least $300. \"Obviously people aren't rushing out to buy that,\" said Chester Osborne, a fourth-generation winemaker at the family-owned D'Arenberg Wines in South Australia's McLaren Vale. He is a mid-sized producer. The loss of China means a 20-30% cut to sales; staff cuts; and grape and bottle price reductions as product bound for China is returned home likely flooding the market. For other wine businesses - such as the 800 exporters dedicated almost exclusively to shipping Australian drops over to China - it means almost certain business closure. At a recent wine-growers meeting, Mr Osborne told the BBC, the talk was all about international politics. Most Australian exporters right now- not just wine-growers - are closely watching the diplomatic play between Canberra and Beijing. \"It's clear as day that that's where we need to be working: how to mend the relationship [with China],\" Mr Osborne said. He contends poor diplomacy on Australia's part has led to these punishments from China. \"The word 'sorry' would be good. I don't think it's going to come out. But saying sorry would be a very, very useful way to change the direction.\" China's grievances Beijing's problems with Australia this year would appear to be articulated in a list circulated by its embassy in Canberra last month. It listed 14 areas where it said Canberra had aggravated relations. These included a 2018 decision to ban Huawei from its 5G tender, not recognising China's claim in contested South China Sea, and supposed \"wanton interference in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan\". But foreign policy experts have pointed out that these have been longstanding policies of Australia's. And many - such as criticism of China's harsh new security law in Hong Kong, or the treatment of its Uighur minority - merely reflect its values as a liberal democracy. \"For a long time, Australia complained about human rights issues in China, but the trade was not affected,\" says Prof James Laurenceson from the Australia -China Relations Institute. Political tensions began in late 2016, but the two-way trade had continued to grow. \"It's only this year the difference in values has been dragged into the trade arena.\" So what's changed this year? As China's power has grown in the region, analysts say Beijing is seeing Australia as too openly lining itself up against it. For over a decade, Australia had appeared to straddle a strategic middle ground in the Asia Pacific - benefiting off the region's competing superpowers. It found security in the US-led strategic alliance, while at the same time hitching its economic growth to exports to China. But increasingly that neutral middle ground has shrunk. Actions this year - such as Australia's call, echoing US sentiments, for a global inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic focused on China- have angered Beijing. China has also responded sharply to Australia's investigations into alleged CCP interference - claiming national security investigations are fuelled by paranoia and bias. Beijing has repeatedly accused Australia of being \"hostile\" and \"unfriendly\", and targeting it unfairly with its security laws. \"China has fundamentally lost trust that Australia is resisting aligning itself with the United States,\" says Mr Laurenceson. \"We were dealing with an accumulation of issues but that's the one really fundamental one that has been elevated this year.\" Mixed messaging What has made the situation worse, analysts say, is poor diplomacy that at times has perhaps reflected Australia's uncertainty on where it stands. On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison launched his strongest criticism yet of Beijing - demanding an apology after a Chinese government official tweeted a fake image portraying an Australian soldier killing a child. However, in the same statement he appealed to China for a relationship re-set. For two years now, Beijing has declined to answer the calls of Australian ministers in a complete breakdown of top-level diplomacy. \"Despite this terribly offensive post today, I would ask again and call on China to re-engage in that dialogue,\" Mr Morrison said on Monday. The request was later ignored by Beijing, who defended the tweet. For wine-growers like Mr Osborne, they're bunking down for the long term and hoping for a decisive, clear line to emerge soon. \"We need to decide what our rhetoric is, and how we move forward as a nation. What battles we want to pick,\" he said. \"A lot of people in China love Australian wine. I remain hopeful that this isn't going to be something that is permanent.\" More on Australia and China:", "summary": "你可以把澳大利亚的葡萄酒产业想象成一个卖酒的商店，几十年来，这家商店一直在海外拥有忠实客户。起初这些客户来自英美。"}

It may be unable to reimburse the funds lost on Friday, a representative told Japanese media. If the theft is confirmed, it will be the largest involving digital currency. Another Tokyo exchange, MtGox, collapsed in 2014 after admitting that $400m had been stolen from its network. The stolen Coincheck assets were said to be kept in a \"hot wallet\" - a part of the exchange connected to the internet. That contrasts with a cold wallet, where funds are stored securely offline. Coincheck says it has the digital address of where the assets were sent. What do we know about the hack? Hackers broke in at 02:57 on Friday (17:57 GMT Thursday), the company said in a statement, but the breach was not discovered until 11:25, nearly eight and a half hours later. Company chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka said 523m NEMs had been sent from Coincheck's NEM address during the breach. \"It's worth 58bn yen based on the calculation at the rate when detected,\" he told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Coincheck was still examining how many customers had been affected and trying to establish whether the break-in had been launched from Japan or another country. \"We know where the funds were sent,\" Mr Otsuka added. \"We are tracing them and if we're able to continue tracking, it may be possible to recover them.\" Coincheck reported the incident to the police and to Japan's Financial Services Agency. How damaging is the loss? NEM, the 10th-largest crypto-currency by market value, fell 11% over a 24-hour period to 87 cents, as of 18:30, Bloomberg news agency reports. Among the other crypto-currencies, Bitcoin dropped 3.4% and Ripple retreated 9.9% on Friday, according to prices seen by the agency. More was lost on Friday than in 2014, when MtGox lost what it thought was 850,000 bitcoins. However, MtGox later found 200.000 bitcoins in an old digital wallet. \"In a worst-case scenario, we may not be able to return clients' assets,\" an unnamed Coincheck representative was quoted as saying on Saturday by Japan's Kyodo news agency. After the collapse of MtGox shook the digital currency world, a licensing system was introduced in Japan to increase oversight of local currency exchanges such as Coincheck. \"What's the lasting impact? It's hard to tell,\" Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, told Bloomberg. \"Japan is one of the most pro-crypto trading countries, among the G-20. In Japan they don't really want a wholesale clampdown. So it will be interesting how Japanese regulators respond to this, if they indeed do.\" What is Coincheck? Founded in 2012, the company is based in Tokyo, where it employed 71 people as of August last year. Its headquarters are located in the city's Shibuya district, an area popular with start-ups that was also home to MtGox, Bloomberg reports. Last year, Coincheck began running adverts on national television featuring popular local comedian Tetsuro Degawa, the agency adds. Kunihiko Sato, a 30-year-old customer from Tokyo, told Kyodo he had deposited about 500,000 yen ($4,600), into his account with the exchange. \"I never thought this kind of thing would happen with Japan's developed legislation,\" he said. How do crypto-currencies work? Whereas money is printed by governments or traditional banks, digital currencies are generated through a complex process known as \"mining\". Transactions are then monitored by a network of computers across the world using a technology called blockchain. There are thousands of them, largely existing online, unlike the notes or coins in your pocket. It may be more useful to think of them as assets, rather than digital cash. The vast majority of Bitcoin holders, for instance, appear to be investors. But the anonymity that crypto-currencies afford has also attracted criminals. The value of a crypto-currency is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell them for.", "summary": "日本最大的数字货币交易机构之一表示，黑客攻击导致其损失5.34亿美元（33.7亿元人民币）的虚拟资产。"}

David Cameron David Cameron is one of the world's few leaders to have an account on the popular Chinese networking site Sina Weibo. But despite amassing more than 910,000 followers since joining in 2013, he is not well-known in China, with many believing Tony Blair is still prime minister. Even those aware of who the current British prime minister is know little about him, regarding him as little more than a potential conduit for gaining access to the producers of Sherlock. Following a recent post, most users asked him if he could \"be troubled to provide timely update reminders about Sherlock\". \"When will the new series be?\" asked user Tianyu Xiang C. \"Dear Prime Minister, the best way to promote relations between China and the UK is: Sherlock season four. By the way, I'm gay and I love you,\" says another. Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has more than 120,000 followers on Sina Weibo and, even though he hasn't posted anything for two years, still manages to be an occasional talking point. Popular Chinese Global People magazine recently posted images of Mr Johnson with many Chinese liking his \"visit to Japan\" and commenting on his \"playing football with super strength\". During his last visit to China in October 2013, the Guardian newspaper said he \"shamelessly upstaged\" Chancellor George Osborne when he was pictured playing the drums in a Chinese shopping centre. However, it seems Mr Johnson's involvement in sport and outdoor activities has won him the most favour with Chinese netizens. User Zhou Meng praised him for being \"insane\" and a \"maverick mayor\" in June, for promoting Formula 1 at Battersea Park, and riding a bicycle to work, both of which are popular pastimes in China. George Osborne Despite being one of the UK's most vocal advocates for closer trade ties with China, George Osborne registers little with most Chinese people. A search on Sina Weibo for Osborne results in endless commentary on Mark Osborne, director of English language film The Little Prince, which has been a huge talking point in China in recent months. Recent comments about the chancellor have been largely derogatory. User jilijames calls him \"big and slippery\". Others say they like seeing \"finance minister Osborne in the news\", because he \"exclaims like Mr Bean\". \"I sometimes forget and call him Mr Osbean,\" says user zj_232232. Philip Hammond Chinese state television showed Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as one of the first people to greet President Jinping when he arrived in the UK. But like George Osborne, a search on Sina Weibo generates results about a better known TV personality in China with the same surname, former Top Gear host Richard Hammond. However, Philip Hammond did register with Chinese social media users for the wrong reasons when he sent a message of condolence following the factory blast in north China's Tianjin in August. Although netizens thanked him, they were largely underwhelmed by his appearance. \"The minister has a boring, mediocre face,\" said Zhang Chi 2015, while user Mi Huyang described him as \"an old aristocrat, who looks like somebody's grandpa.\" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

About 7m people in the UK at risk of heart disease are prescribed statins. Experts fear the articles, which were widely reported in October, will have discouraged people from taking them. British Medical Journal (BMJ) editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee said it was publicising the withdrawal of the side-effects figures \"so that patients who could benefit from statins are not wrongly deterred from starting or continuing treatment because of exaggerated concerns over side effects\". Analysis By James Gallagher, BBC health and science reporter No drug is completely safe, even paracetamol comes with side effects. The real question is whether the benefits of statins, such as cutting the odds of a heart attack, outweigh the risks which include type-2 diabetes. The drugs are currently given to patients at high risk of heart disease, often after a heart attack. These patients have the most to gain by lowering their cholesterol. But there are now plans to prescribe statins to low risk patients too. They would face the same side effects, but for much smaller benefits. This ongoing vitriolic debate over the merits of statins will not help the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence persuade millions of healthy people they should be taking statins for the rest of their lives. Peer reviewed In the UK statins are offered people who have a 20% chance of heart disease in the next decade and studies have also examined whether more people should be offered the drugs to prevent heart problems. In October the BMJ published papers by Harvard Medical School's Dr John Abramson and UK cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra which claimed that side effects occur in 18-20% of statin users. Dr Godlee said this figure was based on data from an \"uncontrolled observational study\" and was incorrect. However, it had not been picked up by the journal's editors or the experts who peer reviewed the work. \"The BMJ and the authors have withdrawn - not the articles - but the statements made in them that side effects of statins were higher than we now think the evidence supports,\" Dr Godlee told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, she said the journal has now set up an independent expert panel to decide whether it needs to completely retract the articles. Dr Godlee said she had established the panel because as editor she had an interest in not immediately retracting the work unless the case against them was clear. 'Very low risk' Medical researcher Prof Sir Rory Collins, who raised doubts over the two papers in March, said the BMJ articles had \"overestimated the side effects of statin therapy by more than 20 times\". He told the Today programme this was likely to have encouraged people to either stop taking statins or not to start treatments in the first place. Asked if he believed statins were safe to take, Sir Rory said trials of more than 100,000 patients showed there was \"a very very low risk of muscle problems\" and a \"small increase in diabetes\". \"These are far outweighed in the high-risk patients and indeed even in the patients at lower risk... by reductions in the risks of heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. 'Extremely painful' \"I was prescribed Simvastatin about nine years ago following heart problems,\" says John Cakebread, from Kent. \"I stopped taking the medication six years later after researching the subject on the internet and finding out about side effects. \"I have now been left with peripheral neuropathy in the feet. \"This is extremely painful. \"My GP refuses to acknowledge this condition and that it could be caused by statins. \"He still wants me to take this medication, but I have refused.\" Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said patients should feel \"reassured\" by the withdrawal of the claims and said people \"should not stop taking their statin\". \"Statins are an important weapon in the fight against heart disease and it is essential that trusted medical journals like the BMJ do not mislead the public,\" he said. Dr Tim Chico, honorary consultant cardiologist at the University of Sheffield, said the drugs were \"one of the most well proven treatments doctors can use for any disease\". He said that he had to explain to patients \"every day\" that the adverse effects of statins are often overestimated. \"Statins save lives. This is beyond doubt,\" he said. Medical experts have long debated whether the use of statins should be extended to people with a \"low-risk\" of heart disease. A study by the University of Oxford in March 2012 concluded that people with a low-risk of heart problems would benefit from statins. Dr Godlee said the BMJ would continue to debate \"whether the use of statins should be extended to a vastly wider population of people at low risk of cardiovascular disease; and the role of saturated fat in heart disease\". The independent panel will be chaired by Dr Iona Heath, a former chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners and a member of the BMJ's ethics committee.", "summary": "《英国医学杂志》可能会撤回声称降胆固醇的药物他汀类药物(statins)不安全的两篇文章。"}

In China, extreme poverty is defined as earning less than $620 (£440) a year. In his speech on Thursday, Mr Xi said the \"arduous task of eradicating extreme poverty has been fulfilled\". \"According to the current criteria, all 98.99 million poor rural population have been taken out of poverty, and 832 poverty-stricken counties as well as 128,000 villages have been removed from the poverty list,\" he said.

The figures for entrance to the most selective universities were even starker at 64% and 23% respectively. Tuition fees, funded by state-sponsored loans, had just been raised to £9,000. The figures, published by the Department for Education, reveal a drop from 66% to 62% in state school pupils progressing to university between 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. It was part of a nine percentage point drop from 71% in state school pupils carrying on into higher education since 2009-2010, the figures showed. But overall there were still many thousands more state school pupils going to university in 2013-14 at 212,065, than private school pupils at 24,990. 'Opportunities' The report, Widening Participation in Higher Education: 2016, noted: \"The 2013-14 cohort was the first cohort where all students were affected by the change in tuition fees in 2012-13.\" Ministers have repeatedly claimed that the introduction of higher fees did not deter pupils from heading to university. The figures were released days after maintenance grants were replaced with loans for students from poor backgrounds in England. They replaced payments of around £3,500 with loans, which will have to be paid back at the end of an undergraduate course, once graduates are earning more than £21,000.

It seems he was only discovered by a relative on Sunday after his mother fell ill and was taken to hospital. He is now undergoing surgery in hospital for his injuries. Police have sealed off the apartment in Haninge, a southern suburb of the capital, to conduct their investigation and are seeking witnesses as they try to piece together what happened. The woman, who is aged 70, is expected to remain in police custody while the investigation continues. If she is found guilty of false imprisonment, police say she could face up to ten years in jail. How was the son found? The relative who discovered the son said she was his sister and had gone to the flat on Sunday evening with her partner after hearing that the mother was in hospital, she told Swedish media. She told Swedish broadcaster SVT she had moved out of the apartment when she was a teenager and had not seen her brother since. As a child, she said, she had tried in vain to raise the alarm over the welfare of the child, who had been removed from school when he was aged 11 or 12. Opening the unlocked door, she said she found the flat in darkness and reeking of urine, decay, dirt and dust. There was no answer when she shouted \"hello\" so she went in, picking her way through mounds of clutter. Hearing a sound from the kitchen, she saw the man sitting in a dark corner, lit by a lamp on the street outside. Sores covered his legs up to his knees. When he saw her, he stood up and whispered her name again and again. He had lost almost all his teeth and his voice was slurred, she told the paper. Somehow, she said, he had recognised her after all the time that had passed and he was not afraid of her. When the man was taken to hospital, doctors alerted the police and the mother was detained. Stockholm prosecutor Emma Olsson told Reuters news agency the man had required surgery, without giving further details. \"The only comment on the time that person has been kind of 'imprisoned' by his mother is: we are sure that it has been for a long period of time,\" police spokesperson Ola Österling told BBC News. \"We don't estimate how many years. That's a part of our investigations now, to get the detailed information about the exact amount of time.\" What do we know of the relationship? Earlier, SVT quoted the relative - who was not immediately identified as the sister - as saying the mother had felt bad about losing an earlier child at a young age. When she gave birth again, her new son was given the same name. She wanted her dead son back and became over-protective. \"I'm just thankful that he got help and is going to survive,\" the relative told Expressen.

Earlier, there were clashes before Brazil's football team played Mexico in Fortaleza in the Confederations Cup. Protesters are angry at corruption and high spending on next year's World Cup. Activists say they have not changed their intention to hold the biggest demonstrations yet on Thursday. The BBC's Julia Carneiro, in Sao Paulo, says hundreds of thousands are expected on the streets there before another round of matches in the Confederations Cup. The continued protests come after the authorities in the two biggest cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, said they would reverse the public-transport fare increases. Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad said the reversal would be a \"big sacrifice\" and said other investments would have to be cut. Rio mayor Eduardo Paes made a similar point, saying the lower transport prices would cost the city 500m reals ($225m; £145m) a year. The mayors of Cuiaba, Recife, Joao Pessoa and other cities have already announced a reduction in bus fares in response to the protests. But the protesters were unmoved by the gesture. \"It's not really about the price [of transport] any more,\" said 18-year-old student Camila Sena, at a protest in Rio de Janeiro's sister city of Niteroi. \"People are so disgusted with the system, so fed up that now we're demanding change.\" One demonstration in the city of Belo Horizonte continued for more than 10 hours. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters in the north-eastern city of Fortaleza on Wednesday after at least 30,000 people rallied there. Clashes erupted when a protest march was stopped by police. Several people were injured, including police officers.Access to the stadium was blocked for at least 30 minutes, but police later allowed people to get in ahead of the game which started at 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT). The BBC's Ben Smith in Fortaleza says that during the protest some demonstrators carried banners reading: \"A teacher is worth more than Neymar\", in a reference to Brazil's star footballer who played and scored against Mexico. Before the match, Neymar spoke in favour of the protesters, saying in a message on Facebook: \"I'm Brazilian and I love my country. I have a family and friends who live in Brazil. For that reason, I want a Brazil which is more just, safer, healthier and more honest. \"The only way I can represent and defend Brazil is on the pitch, playing football. From now on, I will enter the field inspired by this movement.\" Football legend Pele urged demonstrators to end the protests. \"Let's forget all this commotion happening in Brazil, and let's remember how the Brazilian squad is our country and our blood,\" he said. The current unrest is the biggest since 1992, when people took to the streets to demand the impeachment of then-President Fernando Collor de Mello. Vice-President Michel Temer cut short a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories on Wednesday to return to Brazil. President Dilma Rousseff has said she was proud that so many people were fighting for a better country. Many of the demonstrators have complained of the huge sums spent on construction for the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which will be hosted by Rio de Janeiro.", "summary": "尽管巴西政府取消了引发抗议示威的公交票价上涨计划，但仍未能平息蔓延全国的大规模抗议示威。"}

It is believed Catherine's due date is in the second half of this month. Prince George, Prince William and Prince Harry were all born in the wing. Royal officials say the couple are \"hugely grateful\" for the warm wishes they have already received. During the birth of her second child, Catherine will again benefit from the private facility being based within an NHS hospital with facilities for premature babies, and access to hospital specialists. Chaotic interest The Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington describes itself as having offered \"leading private obstetric and neonatal care for 60 years\". It costs more than £5,000 for the first 24 hours of a delivery with an extra £1,000 for each additional night. It has also seen the births of the children of Princess Anne, the Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Michael of Kent. Prince George was delivered there at 16:24 BST on 22 July 2013, weighing 8lb 6oz (3.8kg). Hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV camera crews from across the world gathered outside ahead of his birth. But BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Kensington Palace is hoping the media will not start to turn up this time until it is confirmed that the duchess has been admitted to give birth. \"I think on this occasion the police will move on any reporter, photographer, camera crews and people such as us, who attempt to linger there before it is confirmed that she has gone into hospital to give birth,\" our correspondent said. \"This is a new way of approaching it but it is symptomatic of this desire that there should not be quite such a level of chaotic interest.\" Analysis By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent In the coming weeks the brown door of a private maternity wing will once again become the focus of considerable global attention. The American networks aren't distracted by a domestic election. Facts, once again, will be in short supply but that won't deter the broadcasters (including the BBC). A royal birth, for the monarchy's supporters, is a moment to celebrate. Its critics view it as a moment to consider whether what they call \"this circus\" of a hereditary institution is the best way to run things. For William and Kate a very private moment will, eventually, be shared very publicly. Their second child will be a prince or a princess. But not, as things stand, a future king or queen. Prince George will have a new playmate; the Cambridge family will be expanded; and the monarchy's future will be further strengthened.

Parents of newborns who share a birthday with the new prince or princess will have to register the birth of their child on The Royal Mint's Facebook page to receive the commemorative gift. Succession rule change Prince William and Catherine's second baby will become fourth in line to the throne, behind older brother Prince George, who is 18 months old. The second birth comes as new rules on royal succession have come into force, removing male bias and discrimination against Roman Catholics. If the new baby is a girl, she will follow Prince George and become fourth in line to the throne and will not be overtaken by any future younger brothers. The Act was passed by Parliament in 2013, but all the countries in which the Queen is head of state had to pass any necessary legislation before it took effect.", "summary": "英国凯特王妃已经入住伦敦西部的圣玛丽医院内的私家病房——丽都翼，准备接生她和威廉王子的第二个孩子。"}

But others are less gloomy about AI's prospects. The theoretical physicist, who has the motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is using a new system developed by Intel to speak. Machine learning experts from the British company Swiftkey were also involved in its creation. Their technology, already employed as a smartphone keyboard app, learns how the professor thinks and suggests the words he might want to use next. Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans. \"It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate,\" he said. \"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.\" But others are less pessimistic. \"I believe we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised,\" said Rollo Carpenter, creator of Cleverbot. Cleverbot's software learns from its past conversations, and has gained high scores in the Turing test, fooling a high proportion of people into believing they are talking to a human. Rise of the robots Mr Carpenter says we are a long way from having the computing power or developing the algorithms needed to achieve full artificial intelligence, but believes it will come in the next few decades. \"We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it,\" he says. But he is betting that AI is going to be a positive force. Prof Hawking is not alone in fearing for the future. In the short term, there are concerns that clever machines capable of undertaking tasks done by humans until now will swiftly destroy millions of jobs. In the longer term, the technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is \"our biggest existential threat\". Robotic voice In his BBC interview, Prof Hawking also talks of the benefits and dangers of the internet. He quotes the director of GCHQ's warning about the net becoming the command centre for terrorists: \"More must be done by the internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy.\" He has, however, been an enthusiastic early adopter of all kinds of communication technologies and is looking forward to being able to write much faster with his new system. But one aspect of his own tech - his computer generated voice - has not changed in the latest update. Prof Hawking concedes that it's slightly robotic, but insists he didn't want a more natural voice. \"It has become my trademark, and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent,\" he said. \"I'm told that children who need a computer voice, want one like mine.\"", "summary": "英国著名科学家斯蒂芬·霍金（Stephen Hawking）说，人类创造智能机器的努力威胁自身生存。"}

The BBC knows of one former prisoner who was broken psychologically by his treatment. Many years later, he remains too traumatised to talk about it easily. But others have described their experience in detail. In December 2012, North Korea charged missionary Kenneth Bae with acts \"hostile to the republic\". He had visited the country many times, but was stopped on this occasion and a hard drive with Christian material was discovered. For this \"crime\", he was sentenced to 15 years hard labour, and only released when his health deteriorated seriously - just as seems to have happened in the current case of Otto Warmbier. After his release, Mr Bae wrote a memoir, \"Not Forgotten: The True Story of My Imprisonment in North Korea\" in which he said that he was interrogated from 08:00 in the morning until 22:00 or 23:00 at night every day for the first four weeks of his imprisonment. Under this pressure, he wrote the hundreds of pages of confessions his interrogators demanded. Mr Bae said he would work six days a week on a farm, \"carrying rock, shovelling coal\". His daily routine was to wake at 06:00, eat breakfast, pray, and then be taken to perform the hard labour from 08:00 until 18:00. Under this regime, he lost a lot of weight - an estimated 60lbs (27kg) in the 735 days of his captivity. As his weight dropped, his health increasingly failed and he was repeatedly taken for medical treatment. Apart from the physical toll, there was a psychological pain, a feeling of isolation. He said one interrogator kept telling him: \"No-one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home\". He said: \"I felt like an insect, tangled in the spider web. Every time I moved it got messier, with no way out.\" He does say that, later on, after the month of interrogation was over, he was allowed to see emails and messages from people back home (though this may have been both a comfort and a torment). He seems to have been allowed a bible. When he became seriously ill, it looks as though the North Korean authorities became concerned that he might die, with all the diplomatic difficulty that would cause. And so they arranged his release - as it appears might have happened in the case of Otto Warmbier. Dig their own graves Kenneth Bae is an American citizen originally from South Korea, and so spoke Korean. He said he thought his treatment as a prisoner with a cell of his own, including a bed and a toilet, was not as tough as that for North Koreans held in the vast array of camps for ordinary crime or for dissent. He may be right on this. Amnesty International has described the prison camps as harsh beyond endurance. \"Hundreds of thousands of people - including children - are detained in political prison camps and other detention facilities in North Korea,\" it says. \"Many of those have not committed any crime, but are merely family members of those deemed guilty of serious political crimes\". Amnesty analyses aerial pictures of the camps and says that one of them is three times the size of Washington DC contains 20,000 inmates. According to one former official it had talked to, detainees were forced to dig their own graves and rape was used as punishment, the victims then disappearing. Kenneth Bae does not say he was physically tortured or beaten. His decline in health was because the harshness of the prison regime exacerbated his diabetes, high blood pressure and a kidney condition. That may or may not be the case of Otto Warmbier. But there are questions which the authorities in the United States are surely asking: How did he end up in a coma? And why did North Korea take a year to tell any outside country? If it was because of some sort of physical attack, there might be political pressure on President Donald Trump to get tougher with the regime in Pyongyang. There is one other intriguing question: do prisoners influence their jailers? Stockholm Syndrome is when a hostage comes to identify with the people holding him or her, but is there a reverse Stockholm Syndrome? Kenneth Bae found that his captors were curious about life in the West. They wanted to know how much a house cost, and whether many people really did own their own home and car. \"At the beginning, it was difficult but because I speak the language I was able to communicate,\" he said later, after he was freed. North Koreans had been told of a grim life in America where 99% of people lived in poverty. \"I told them most people own a house and a car, and they said: 'That can't be right'.\"", "summary": "毫无疑问，朝鲜一直用非常粗暴的方式对待囚犯。"}

Her latest memoir, The Princess Diarist, contained revelations of an affair with Harrison Ford while the pair were shooting the first Star Wars film in 1976. Fisher endured a difficult private life, and discussed her years of mental illness and drug addiction in interviews and writing. An early memoir was called Wishful Drinking.

The duke and duchess have a son, George, who is four, and a daughter, Charlotte, aged two. With the previous two pregnancies, the couple announced them before the 12-week mark - when most women have their first scan - because of the duchess being unwell with hyperemesis gravidarum. Her first pregnancy was revealed when she was just a few weeks pregnant with Prince George after she was admitted to hospital in December 2012. The duchess's second pregnancy with Princess Charlotte was announced in September 2014, when she was treated at the palace for the condition. Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting - with one of the main dangers being dehydration. 'Shaping future of monarchy' By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Once again Prince William and his wife - who are very focused on being in control - have been thwarted. And once again, it's due to circumstances outside their control. The couple have been forced to make the announcement at a time not of their choosing - and while the duchess is still in the early stages of her pregnancy - because she is suffering from very acute morning sickness. They were poised to take on more royal duties. They are now preparing to welcome another addition to their family. An addition that will attract considerable global interest. The child's grandmother is the late Diana, Princess of Wales. This princess or prince is unlikely to be crowned monarch. As things stand, that future awaits their brother, Prince George. So there is no constitutional significance to the birth next year. But an ancient institution that already appears pretty secure has just been further buttressed. The three Cambridge siblings will fashion the future of the British monarchy well into the 21st Century. Read more from Peter The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the announcement comes at the start of a \"significant week\" for the family \"because Prince George is due to start at big school.\" \"Presumably his mother would be keen to take him to that, [but] whether she is going to be well enough to do that remains to be seen,\" he told BBC News. \"It had also been expected that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would be taking a foreign trip this autumn,\" he added. \"Whether they will be able to do that or whether the duchess will be well enough to do that also remains to be seen.\" The expected child will become the fifth in line to the throne behind Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. A change - which stops royal sons taking precedence over their female siblings in the line of succession - came into force in March 2015. The child will be the Queen's sixth great-grandchild. The last third-born monarch To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. Arriving in Manchester for a royal visit, Prince Harry - who will drop to sixth in line to the throne when the child is born - said the news was \"fantastic\" and he was \"very, very happy\". Clarence House has tweeted on behalf of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to say they are \"delighted\".

In response, he will tell EU leaders at a meeting in Brussels later that they must focus on boosting the economy. The three big pro-EU centrist blocs are still on course for a majority. But they have lost seats in the European Parliament to parties seeking to curb EU powers or abolish the union, among them the UK Independence Party which came first in the domestic vote with 27% according to provisional results. In France, the far-right National Front stormed to victory with a preliminary 25% of the vote, pushing Mr Hollande's Socialists into third place. National Front President Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday that her party would use its electoral mandate to \"defend France\" and fight \"crazy measures like votes for immigrants\". The BBC's Matthew Price in Brussels says she made a direct challenge, not just to French politicians, but to Brussels too - saying it must listen to the people, and that the French had to protect their nation. This agenda will affect policy-making in the EU in the coming years, our correspondent says. Vote 2014 Full coverage of results Speaking on French TV, Mr Hollande - a leading champion of the EU - said the project had become \"remote and incomprehensible\", and that that had to change. \"Europe has to be simple, clear, to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary,\" he said. He said the union had overcome the crisis in the eurozone \"but at what price? An austerity that has ended up disheartening the people\". When European Union leaders meet on Tuesday he would \"reaffirm that the priority is growth, jobs and investment\", he said. Matthew Price, BBC News, Brussels Europe has not \"voted against the EU\". The vast majority of those who bothered to cast a ballot did so for parties that are pro-EU, and they will make up the majority in the new parliament. Yes, the focus is understandably on France and the UK, with Denmark, Greece, and others also giving Euro-enthusiasts cause for concern. However in many countries mainstream parties dominated - in Germany, Italy, Poland where it was felt a growing Eurosceptic movement could break through, in the Netherlands and elsewhere. So the results do not constitute a \"problem\" as such for the leaders of the EU. Many leaders will point this out around the dinner table tonight. Others, however, will stress that a sizeable chunk of voters chose parties that want \"Brussels\" to change, and that the EU needs to address this issue if it is to maintain popular support and legitimacy in the longer term. Ahead of this election most leaders were not planning to come to Brussels to discuss how to reset their country's relationship with the EU. David Cameron was of course - but others were not. Will others - under domestic pressure - now join him? Anti-EU forces overshadow Brussels talks Mrs Merkel - whose conservative Christian Democratic Union won a comfortable 35% of the vote in Germany - said it was now up to the established parties of Europe to win voters back by focusing on \"improving competitiveness, on growth and creating jobs\". \"This is the best answer to the disappointed people who voted in a way we didn't wish for,\" she said. Elsewhere in Europe, the anti-EU UKIP was celebrating winning 27% of the vote, marking the first time in a century that a party other than the Conservatives or Labour has won any UK election. Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative party lost seven seats, said it was clear voters were \"deeply disillusioned\" with Europe and that the message was \"received and understood\". But he insisted he would neither bring forward the date of an in/out referendum on UK withdrawal from the EU - scheduled for 2017 - nor seek a pact with UKIP. 'Truly democratic debate' Despite the unprecedented Eurosceptic gains across the Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, outgoing president of the European Commission, insisted that the pro-EU blocs still had \"a very solid and workable majority\". The centre-right European People's Party appears set to win 213 out of the 751 seats, with 28.36% across the bloc, according to estimated results issued by the European Parliament. That would mean it remains the biggest group - but with more than 60 seats fewer than before. The Socialist alliance has a projected 190 seats, with 25.3% of the vote, the Liberals 9% and the Greens 7%. The Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group appeared to have around 38 seats - including the 24 for UKIP. But the number of non-attached right-wing MEPs is set to rise, boosting the Eurosceptic camp. Mr Barroso said a \"truly democratic debate\" was needed to address the concerns of those who did not vote, or \"voted in protest\". Turnout across Europe is estimated at 43.1%, the first time it has not fallen since the previous election - but it has only increased by 0.1%. Result highlights (from European Parliament website): The election is the biggest exercise in multi-national democracy in the world, affecting the lives of the EU's 500 million citizens. The parliament's powers have expanded since the last election in 2009, and it is hoping to have a decisive say in who gets the EU's top job, president of the European Commission.

And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus to look out for and act upon. If you or someone you live with has a new continuous cough or high temperature, the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of spreading coronavirus to others. Coronavirus: What should I do?

It is the first official picture of Prince George to be released since his christening last October. The visit to Australia and New Zealand will be his first official overseas tour. The trip echoes the Prince and Princess of Wales's visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1983 when the couple took William, then aged nine months, with them. The tour will begin in Wellington, where the Cambridges will be greeted with a ceremonial welcome to New Zealand, called a Powhiri in Maori. They will see a yacht race, visit a rugby stadium and a vineyard, and there will also be Maori engagements in Christchurch and Dunedin. During their time in New Zealand, they will attend a ceremony in Blenheim to recognise the sacrifice of members of the Australian and New Zealand armed forces in the First World War.

But they warn aspirin can cause internal bleeding and say medical advice must be sought before using it. The Queen Mary University of London report is in the Annals of Oncology. Weighing up benefits Scientists examined some 200 studies investigating the benefits and harms of taking aspirin - an area of continuing medical debate. They found the drug reduced the number of cases and deaths from bowel, stomach and oesophageal cancer by some 30-40%. There was weaker and more variable evidence that the drug reduced deaths from breast, prostate and lung cancer too. And the study found people needed to take the drug for at least five years to see any benefits. Prof Jack Cuzick, at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research, urged all healthy people aged 50 and above to consider taking a small dose (75mg) of the drug every day for a decade. Researchers predicted if 1,000 individuals aged 60 took the drug for 10 years, a further decade later there would be: Prof Cuzick, who has been taking aspirin for four years, said: \"Whilst there are some serious side-effects that can't be ignored, taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important thing we can do to reduce cancer after stopping smoking and reducing obesity, and will probably be much easier to implement.\" Individual risks They found benefits continued even when people stopped taking the drug, but say it is unclear exactly how long people should use it for. As the risk of internal bleeding rises as an individual gets older, they suggest a cut-off point of 10 years. There is still uncertainty whether other doses of the drug could offer more protection. Aspirin's well known possible side-effects include bleeding in the stomach and the brain. And while the study suggests 122,000 lives could be saved if everyone in the UK aged 50-64 took the drug, this is balanced against the estimated 18,000 deaths from side-effects. Experts warn anyone at high risk of bleeding, including people with blood disorders who take blood thinning medication, or are frequent smokers or drinkers, are more likely to suffer these side-effects. They recommend anyone considering daily medication should speak to their doctors to discuss individual risks. Dr Julie Sharp, at Cancer Research UK, said: \"Aspirin is showing promise in preventing certain types of cancer, but it's vital that we balance this with the complications it can cause. \"Before aspirin can be recommended for cancer prevention, some important questions need to be answered and tests need to be developed to predict who is likely to have side-effects.\" Exactly how aspirin protects against cancer is unknown.

Kensington Palace declined to comment. Ms Markle's estranged half-sister said he had faced an \"unbelievable stress\". Speaking to Australia's Sunrise morning TV programme from Orlando, Florida, Samantha Markle said she was not sure if Mr Markle would be travelling to Windsor. \"He sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery,\" she said. \"We're all hoping he pulls through this now.\" Meanwhile, Kensington Palace has announced Princess Charlotte will be among the bridesmaids and her brother Prince George will be a pageboy at the wedding this weekend. Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy at the weekend, following reports that he staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the wedding. The pictures showed Mr Markle - apparently unaware he was being photographed - in a series of wedding-related activities, including being measured for a wedding suit. On Monday, Mr Markle reportedly told celebrity news website TMZ that he would not attend the wedding. TMZ later reported that Mr Markle had and wanted to attend - although he might not be able to because of health concerns. And in a third report, the website said that the health issues and planned surgery would prevent him from attending after all. On Tuesday evening, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Ms Markle wanted her father to be there, but her major concern would be for his wellbeing. Kensington Palace has said events are \"a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle\". \"She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation,\" the palace said in a statement on Monday. Analysis By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One minute there's a perfectly scripted wedding about to reach its traditional-yet-modern, royal-yet-diverse climax in the St George's chapel at Windsor. The next minute there's twists and turns worthy of the finest soap opera. It is difficult to believe that things are quite where the various Palaces involved in this wedding thought they would be at this stage. It is of course conceivable that Thomas Markle could have heart surgery at today, somehow find the energy to make a transatlantic flight, meet the Queen, go to the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle. But it seems a little unlikely. So who will walk Meghan down the aisle? Who will step under the standards of the Knights of the Garter, over the vault containing the remains of Henry VIII and Charles I and past 600 of years of Royal, English and British history? Will it be Meghan's mother Doria, or will she walk alone? Now, there's a thought. Read more from Jonny Mr Markle had been due to meet Prince Harry for the first time this week, as well as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, before walking his daughter down the aisle at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Samantha, who has not spoken to her famous sibling in three years - and will not be attending the wedding - told Good Morning Britain the photographs had been done with \"good intention\" and not for money. She previously admitted the pictures had been her idea, in order to portray a positive image. Ask me Share this chatbot The father of the ex-Suits actress lives in Mexico and is a former lighting director who worked on programmes including the 1980s TV show Married with Children and General Hospital, for which he and his team won two Emmy awards. He and Ms Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, divorced when Ms Markle was six years old. A brief history of TMZ TMZ - which launched in 2005 - stands for Thirty-Mile Zone, an old Hollywood expression that describes the area where the studios are based and where most celebrities happen to live. The US celebrity news site, which scooped the world's media on Thomas Markle's wedding plans, is no stranger to a-list exclusives (albeit not without controversy): Mr Markle, who has two children - including Samantha - from his first marriage, filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Ms Markle has previously said: \"It's safe to say I have always been a daddy's girl - he taught me how to fish, to appreciate Busby Berkeley films, write thank-you notes, and spend my weekends in Little Tokyo eating chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura.\" The wedding will take place on 19 May at 12:00 BST at St George's Chapel in Windsor. With five days to go, Kensington Palace revealed that Ms Markle will spend her last night before getting married at a luxury Buckinghamshire hotel with her mother, Doria.

It has been finalised after a week of negotiations between scientists and government officials. Natural gas is seen as a key bridge to move energy production away from oil and coal. But there have been battles between participants over who will pay for this energy transition. The report is the work of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was set up to provide a clear scientific view on climate change and its impacts. The Summary for Policymakers on mitigation paints a picture of a world with carbon emissions rising rapidly. \"The high speed mitigation train needs to leave the station very soon, and all of global society will have to get on board,\" the IPCC's chair Rajendra Pachauri told journalists in Berlin at the launch of the report. Dr Youba Sokono, a co-chair of the IPCC's working group 3, which drew up the report, said science has spoken. He added that policy makers were \"the navigators, they have to make decisions, scientists are the map makers\". The UK's Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said global warming needed to be tackled using \"all technologies\". He told BBC News: \"We can do this, we have to because it's so challenging and threatening to our economies and societies, our health, our food security. The report today shows we can do it if we have the political will.\" He added that the UK government was a leader on the use of renewable energy sources, saying: \"We've, for example, doubled the amount of renewable electricity in the last few years. We're likely to do better than our targets in increasing renewable electricity. But we've got to do more.\" About half of all the carbon that humans have pumped into the atmosphere since 1750 has been emitted in the last 40 years. Rates have been rising fast since 2000, despite the global economic crash. The report points to an increased use of coal in the decade from the turn of the millennium , \"reversing the longstanding trend of decarbonisation of the world's energy supply\". Driven by a global increase in population and economic activity, global surface temperature increases will be between 3.7C and 4.8C in 2100 if no new action is taken. This is way above the 2 degree level, regarded as the point beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change will be felt. However, the scientists involved in the report say this situation can be turned around. \"It needs a big change in the energy sector, that is undoubtedly true,\" said Prof Jim Skea, vice-chair of working group 3. \"One of the biggest areas that's important is getting the carbon out of electricity, so renewable energy, nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, that's all part of the menu if we are going to make the transition to stay under the 2 degree target.\" It is not a simple task. To be sure of staying below 2 degrees, the amount of carbon in the air needs to be around 450 parts per million by 2100. To get there, emissions in 2050 need to be 40-70% lower than they were in 2010. The IPCC says that renewables are a critical part of that pathway. Since the last report in 2007, the scientists say that renewable energy has come on in leaps and bounds. In 2012, renewables accounted for just over half of the new electricity generation added around the world. The scientists stress that renewables are becoming economically competitive with fossil fuels and also offer a range of other benefits, including clean air and energy security. \"It certainly is the end for carbon intensive fuels that's for sure,\" said Jennifer Morgan from the World Resources Institute, who was a review editor on one of the chapters of the IPCC report. \"There needs to be a massive shift away from fossil fuels and investment needs to shift to going 100% clean as fast as possible.\" Prof Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of working group 3, said: \"Mitigation does not mean the world has to sacrifice economic growth.\" He explained that the report added \"modest hope\", but added: \"Climate policy is not a free lunch.\" One of the surprising endorsements in the report is natural gas. \"Emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants,\" says the summary. The report describes natural gas as a \"bridge\" technology with deployment increasing before peaking and falling below current levels by 2050. However many of the scenarios examined by the panel would still involve an \"overshoot\" of the target range. To cope with this the world may need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Combining carbon capture and storage with bioenergy is seen as one potential solution, but the report is lukewarm on these ideas, saying the \"methods are uncertain\" and are \"associated with risks\". Timing is everything, say the scientists. \"Delaying mitigation efforts beyond those in place today through 2030 is estimated to substantially increase the difficulty of the transition to low longer-term emissions,\" says the summary. \"If we delay we are faced with hard choices,\" said Prof Skea. \"Do we give up on the 2 degrees target or do we employ these techniques that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere - if we proceed promptly and we get a deal in Paris next year, then we need to rely less on these ideas.\" The report points out that there needs to be huge shifts in investment if the worst impacts of rising temperatures are to be avoided. Investment in renewables and other low carbon sources needs to at least treble by the middle of the century, while money flowing into fossil fuels has to diminish. But differences have emerged over who should make the cuts in emissions and who should pay for the switch to low carbon energy sources. Developed and developing countries have clashed here in Berlin, echoing divisions found in the UN negotiations. \"It is true that some of the dynamics that we see in the UNFCCC negotiations were visible here as well,\" said Kaisa Kosenen from Greenpeace. \"It is an indication that the key question of equity - who should do what and who should pay for the damages already caused.\" Other participants believed that this new report could actually help push the UN process forward. \"I hope that this information from the IPCC can kind of do a bit of a tectonic shift into a co-operating mode rather than a finger pointing mode between countries,\" said Jennifer Morgan. \"There's too much at stake.\" Follow Matt on Twitter.", "summary": "联合国周日（13日）公布一份期待已久的对应气候变化的报告，呼吁全世界尽快摆脱碳密集型燃料，迅速转向可再生能源的使用。"}

The processing centre has been set up on an abandoned football ground to help the stranded migrants.

Athens has already requested emergency EU assistance to deal with migrants arriving from Turkey. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the \"breathtaking\" flow of migrants into Germany would change the country in the coming years. Hungary has become a flashpoint as thousands of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa move north to claim asylum in Germany and other countries. The country's defence minister, Csaba Hende, resigned on Monday, reportedly over problems with the construction of a border fence meant to keep migrants out. In other developments: Hungary had previously blocked migrants heading north, insisting they be registered there first as required under EU rules. But it dropped restrictions on Friday after struggling to cope with thousands camping in Budapest. About 20,000 migrants made their way from Hungary into Austria and Germany over the weekend. At Roszke, scuffles erupted as some migrants who had broken out of a holding centre tried to force their way past police. Stones were thrown at officers, who responded with pepper spray. About 300 managed to run to a nearby motorway, chanting \"Germany, Germany\". As darkness fell, they were walking, escorted by police, towards Budapest, 170km (105 miles) away. Tensions building for days: The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary While Hungary has allocated $73m (£47m) to spend on a 175km (110 mile) fence along the Serbian border, no resources were devoted to humanitarian infrastructure at the police assembly point in a cornfield near Roszke. There are only four toilets, and police and aid workers struggled to feed and keep people warm as the temperatures plunged to 5C (41F). A shortage of buses to take them to a new registration centre just 2km away, and a shortage of interpreters to explain what was going on, led to the breakout from the field and a new march up the M5 motorway towards Budapest on Monday evening.

Danish anti-migrant ads in Lebanon Nine key moments in crisis An estimated 340,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Europe so far this year, most braving dangerous sea journeys from North Africa and Turkey. Germany, where most migrants are headed and which expects 800,000 asylum requests this year, has said it wants other EU states to help shoulder the burden. But the crisis has divided the 28-nation bloc.

Earlier, Mrs Merkel thanked volunteers who had welcomed those arriving over the weekend, saying they had \"painted a picture of Germany which can make us proud of our country\". However, she said that although Germany was \"a country willing to take people in\", it was \"time for the European Union to pull its weight\". Mrs Merkel is facing criticism at home over Germany's willingness to accept so many asylum seekers. The Bavarian Christian Social Union, a sister party to Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats, accused her of sending a \"wrong signal\". Hungary, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, has rejected the idea of official quotas. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said \"as long as we can't defend Europe's outer borders, it is not worth talking about how many people we can take in\". The Hungarian parliament last week passed tough new legislation on illegal immigrants. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary says Csaba Hende's surprise resignation has been seized on by opposition parties as proof that the government's tough anti-migrant policies have failed. He oversaw army efforts to construct a razor-wire fence in just six weeks but it was rechristened a \"wire barrier\" in recognition of its limited success. In addition to the razor-wire barrier, the army is also building a 4m-high (13ft) fence along the border that was supposed to have been finished last month but remains largely incomplete. Meanwhile, the influx of migrants shows no signs of abating. More boatloads arrived in the Greek islands on Monday, adding to an already desperate situation in some areas. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "数百移民突破匈牙利接壤塞尔维亚边界的警方封锁线，并徒步走向匈牙利首都布达佩斯。"}

The Yidan Prize will award nearly $8m (£6.64m) every year to two research projects that have the potential to \"transform\" global education. Charles Chen Yidan, who co-founded China's internet company, Tencent, wants to use the prize to scale up innovative education research projects and replicate them across the world. Universities, governments and think tanks have reacted enthusiastically to the prize, and leading US institutions like Harvard and MIT have already submitted several nominations. But the winner might not necessarily be a household name in education. Even a local project could win the prize, if it can prove it has been effective. \"As long as an idea is replicable in other regions, we can give them an award,\" says Mr Chen. More than exams Mr Chen, now aged 45, became one of China's richest men after co-founding Tencent in 1998. In 2013, he stepped down to focus on educational philanthropy. His interest in education came from his family. His grandmother was illiterate but insisted that Mr Chen's father got a good education. Mr Chen himself studied applied chemistry as an undergraduate at Shenzhen University and took a master's degree in economic law at Nanjing University. His educational philosophy has also been shaped by the \"tremendous pressure\" he felt while studying for China's \"gaokao\" higher education entrance examinations. So he set up Wuhan College, a private university in China, which focuses on \"whole-person development\" rather than rote-learning and examinations. More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch. You can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page. The college aims to train talented students to join China's technology industry. Executives from Tencent helped to design the college's curriculum, recruit students and teach classes, so that its graduates are trained in the skills required by employers. But Mr Chen was frustrated that this college only reached a limited number of students. So he decided a global education prize would be the best way to improve education for millions of young people. Future trends Mr Chen, speaking on a tour of Europe to promote the prize to universities, governments, NGOs and think tanks, says he has already been inundated with nominations. He wants the prize to focus the attention of universities and governments on future trends in education. \"We find that no matter whether people come from a rich or developing country, in the east or the west, they are talking about similar concerns,\" says Mr Yidan. These are questions about children from rich families having the best access to education, and whether students in some countries face too many exams. The prize-winners will be chosen by an independent committee of educational experts led by Dr Koichiro Matsuura, former director-general of Unesco. They are looking for nominations that are innovative and sustainable, that reform existing educational structures, and that respond to what might be the future challenges for education. Grey power But Mr Chen also has his own ideas about how to improve global education. Speaking through a translator but occasionally breaking into English to reinforce a point, he said he wants to find ways to make the most of the expertise of retired teachers. \"They are a valuable resource that we need to make better use of,\" he says. He thinks that collecting \"big data\" on students can improve the education that individual students receive. \"By analysing big data, we can find bespoke ways to help pupils in need,\" he says. Unsurprisingly for the co-founder of an internet company, he believes that technology will transform education. This latest education prize is now the most valuable. The Global Teacher Prize, run by the Varkey Foundation, gives $1m (£830,000) annually to a teacher who has made an \"outstanding contribution\" to education. The Broad Prize for Urban Education, which ran from 2002 to 2014, gave $1m every year to a school district in the US that significantly improved the academic performance of low-income and minority students. The WISE Prize for education, supported by the Qatar Foundation, awards $500,000 (£415,000) to the winning laureate. Long-term investment But is a prize really the best way to improve education? Dan Sarofian-Butin, founding dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, says that prize money can be a poor way of achieving change. \"Rather than give a one-off cash prize, I hope the Yidan Prize will nurture and sustain its winners over a period of years,\" he says. \"If you look at the TV show Dragons' Den, or Shark Tank in the US, what the winners really get is not just the investment money from the sharks, but their expertise, their network of contacts and firms, their foot in the door with many companies, and their national exposure. \"Likewise, a really powerful education prize would create a mechanism that fostered exactly such mentoring, networking, and sustainability.\" Andreas Schleicher, education director at the OECD, welcomes the Yidan Prize as an incentive for innovation in education. \"When we surveyed teachers, less than a quarter of them said they would be recognised for greater levels of innovation,\" he said. \"The highly industrial and compliance-based organisation of education generally means that even where good ideas are generated, they don't scale and spread.\" Nominations close at the end of March and the winners will be announced in September.", "summary": "中国的科技富翁陈一丹创建了全球奖金最丰厚的教育奖。"}

One general was seen studying a diagram of the \"devastating\" torpedo system. Launched by a submarine, it would create \"wide areas of radioactive contamination\", the document says. The \"oceanic multi-purpose Status-6 system\" is designed to \"destroy important economic installations of the enemy in coastal areas and cause guaranteed devastating damage to the country's territory by creating wide areas of radioactive contamination, rendering them unusable for military, economic or other activity for a long time\", the document says. \"It's true some secret data got into the shot, therefore it was subsequently deleted,\" said Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"In future we will undoubtedly take preventive measures so this does not happen again.\" The US Defence Department said it had seen the report, but would not comment further. \"We are aware of the video footage, but defer to the Russian navy as to its authenticity,\" a Pentagon spokesperson told the BBC. However, the Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta later reported details of the weapon, without showing the diagram, and speculated about a super-radioactive cobalt device. So the leak may not have been accidental. Cobalt warhead? On the diagram the giant torpedo's range is given as \"up to 10,000km\" (6,200 miles) and depth of trajectory is \"up to 1,000m\" (3,300ft). It was developed by Rubin, a submarine design bureau in St Petersburg. It would, apparently, be launched by nuclear-powered submarines of the 09852 \"Belgorod\" and 09851 \"Khabarovsk\" series. Rossiiskaya Gazeta called the torpedo a \"robotic mini-submarine\", travelling at 100 knots (185km/h; 115mph), which would \"avoid all acoustic tracking devices and other traps\". Just before the torpedo diagram came into view in the state TV report, Mr Putin could be heard telling the generals that the US and its Nato allies were forging ahead with a global anti-missile defence system \"unfortunately ignoring our concerns and our offers of co-operation\". He said the Western defence project was \"an attempt to undermine the existing parity in strategic nuclear weapons and essentially to upset the whole system of global and regional stability\". In June Mr Putin said Russia would put more than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles into service this year. US 'real goal' The US is developing the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system to counter the perceived threat of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles from Iran or another so-called \"rogue\" state. Under the plan, air defence missiles will eventually be sited on land in Romania and Poland. Mr Putin dismissed that Nato argument, pointing to the international deal, agreed this year, imposing limits on Iran's nuclear programme. \"References to an Iranian or North Korean nuclear missile threat are just used to conceal the true plans - their real goal is to neutralise the strategic nuclear potential of other nuclear states... above all, of course, Russia,\" Mr Putin told the generals in Sochi, a Black Sea resort. He said Russia would continue developing strategic offensive systems capable of penetrating any anti-missile defence. According to state-run Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the destructive power attributed to the new torpedo's warhead would fit the description of a cobalt bomb. That would be a type of thermonuclear warhead with a layer of cobalt-59, which on detonation would be transmuted into highly radioactive cobalt-60 with a half-life longer than five years. Such a weapon would guarantee \"that everything living will be killed\", the paper said - there would not even be any survivors in bunkers. A cobalt bomb has never been tested because of the devastating radiation it would unleash. \"But it can be considered as a means of deterrence - like the Perimetr system, which is on combat readiness, which guarantees retaliation with all of Russia's nuclear forces even if command posts and the country's leadership have been annihilated\".

Several governments around the world have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks, citing security concerns. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. So why is the company proving so controversial? What is 5G? Fifth-generation mobile broadband is coming over the next year or so, promising download and browsing speeds 10 to 20 times faster than those today's 4G networks can offer. This superfast mobile connectivity means you might be able to livestream a high-definition film to your phone, say, or enjoy much higher quality augmented and virtual reality experiences while you're out and about. It will also power the \"internet of things\", enabling connected machines, from traffic lights to driverless cars, to communicate with each other. What is Huawei? The company started out making equipment for mobile phone networks and has grown rapidly, eclipsing the likes of Nokia and Ericsson, to become a global leader. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, and Huawei has now captured about 16% of the global market, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. The firm's founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer, started Huawei in 1987. It's based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. So is Huawei a security threat? The US points to Mr Ren's military background and its growing global role to argue it represents a risk to national security. In principle, controlling the technology that sits at the heart of vital communications networks gives Huawei the capacity to conduct espionage or disrupt communications during any future dispute, particularly as more things, from autonomous vehicles to domestic appliances, become connected to the internet. Countries using Huawei equipment monitor such risks carefully. But the US also points more generally to China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 that says organisations must \"support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\". As a result, the US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. That's three of the five so-called \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing community. A fourth, Canada, is reviewing its relationship with the firm. And several European telecoms operators are considering removing the firm's equipment from their networks. Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk has moved to quell concerns about its operations, describing it as \"the most open [and] transparent company in the world\". In December, Canada arrested Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou - Mr Ren's daughter - at the request of the US. Washington alleges that she committed fraud by lying to US banks about her firm's ties to a telecoms company that did business in Iran - and that business was a breach of sanctions on Iran. Huawei denies any wrongdoing, while China's ambassador to Canada has warned Ottawa there could be repercussions if Canada bans the firm. The UK has not taken a position, although it is also coming under pressure from the US to do so. Washington has warned its allies about the risks of using Huawei technology. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that European countries that use the company's equipment \"makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them\". Why hasn't the UK blocked Huawei? The UK government has admitted to \"strains\" in the relationship with Huawei. The body tasked with overseeing internet security in Britain, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - has asked Huawei to fix problems that pose \"new risks\" to the network. But the NCSC recently concluded that any risk posed by involving the Chinese technology giant in the development of new networks can be managed. Alex Younger, the head of the UK's intelligence service MI6, has suggested that \"some decisions\" lie ahead over Huawei's role, because 5G networks will make it harder to monitor security. BT has announced it is in the process of removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations and will not use the Chinese company's gear in central parts of the next 5G network. But Huawei has been providing technology to UK firms for more than a decade and Britain is keen to maintain a good relationship with China on trade and investment as it prepares for Brexit. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - have already been working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings and it might not be easy to change that at short notice. The UK's mobile phone operators are waiting for a decision from the government on whether they can continue to use the Chinese giant's equipment - the ruling is expected to come in late March or early April. What does Huawei say? The company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security when supplying technology and that at least some of the hostility towards it is because the firm poses a competitive threat. In the past the Chinese government has argued that moves to block the firm's products amount to \"protectionism\" and \"discriminatory practices\". Huawei has also filed a lawsuit challenging US government restrictions on its products being used by federal agencies. In a statement announcing the move, a spokesman for Huawei said the US had \"repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions\". The company also accused the US government of misleading the public about Huawei. The new hostility towards the company comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and China, with President Trump accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices and of facilitating the theft of intellectual property from US firms. Furthermore as several countries simultaneously plan to introduce faster 5G networks, the stakes are high for firms that win contracts. Emily Taylor at Chatham House said there was a \"standards war\" going on behind the scenes. \"I think the trade advantage from setting standards that favour your own domestic suppliers' technologies also plays a part in this,\" she told the BBC.", "summary": "最近接连不断传出关于中国电讯巨头华为的消息，为中美领导刚达成贸易战停火协议带来疑问。最近的消息说，华为的首席财务官，华为创始人任正非的女儿孟晚舟在加拿大被捕，美国要求加拿大引渡孟晚舟。"}

Earlier, Syrian state media said gunmen had opened fire on Red Cross staff travelling on the road between Sarmin and Saraqeb in Idlib province. The ICRC says it has been struggling to gain access across Syria to provide aid to injured and displaced people. Appeal A convoy carrying six ICRC staff members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was intercepted by unidentified armed gunmen near the town of Saraqeb in Idlib province, ICRC spokeswoman Rima Kamal told the BBC. \"We call for the immediate release of the seven colleagues abducted this morning... who work tirelessly to provide assistance to those most in need in Syria. Incidents such as this one unfortunately will undermine our capacity to assist those who need our help,\" she said. The ICRC has declined to reveal the identity, gender or nationality of the abducted workers but they are believed to include both local and international staff, who are mainly medical specialists. Syrian state news agency Sana earlier quoted an unnamed official as saying the workers were abducted and taken to an unknown location after gunmen blocked their path and shot at their convoy. The aid agency did not confirm whether shots had been fired, but said the team's vehicles were also missing. An ICRC statement said the vehicles they were travelling in had been clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem, \"which is not a religious symbol\". Another ICRC spokesman, Simon Schorno, told Associated Press the attack took place at around 11:30 (08:30 GMT) on Sunday as the team was returning to Damascus. He said the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation and deliver aid in what he described as \"a difficult area to go in\". It is not yet clear who carried out the kidnapping, but Syrian state TV blamed it on what it called \"armed terrorists\" - a term it frequently uses to describe anti-government rebels. Hardline Islamist rebels are known to operate in the area, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut. Kidnappings, particularly of aid workers and journalists, have become increasingly common in the north, where much of the countryside has fallen into rebel hands. In August, the ICRC said the number of Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers who had lost their lives since the start of the conflict had risen to 22. The abductions will clearly complicate further the already difficult and dangerous task of providing humanitarian aid to all parts of the country, he adds, at a time when the UN is pressing all sides to allow freer access. On Saturday, the Syrian government began the evacuation of around 1,500 civilians, mainly women and children, from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months. Many of those coming out of Muadhamiya, south-west of Damascus, were said to be exhausted and traumatised. In a separate development, the state news agency said two car bombs exploded on Sunday evening near the state TV building in Damascus. The TV headquarters in the capital's Umayyad Square was reportedly damaged in the attack, but there was no immediate word on casualties, the agency reported. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.", "summary": "国际红十字会称，一组武装分子在叙利亚西北部绑架了6名红十字会工作人员及另一名红新月会志愿者。"}

This meant that there would be greater \"pressure on them to make the right decisions concerning where they invest their time and money\", said researcher Hubert Ertl. \"However, the complexity of the range of fee waivers and bursaries makes it difficult for them to compare the costs of studying at different universities,\" said Dr Ertl. More than three-quarters of these sixth formers believed that graduates would be likely to earn more than non-graduates. But there remained concerns about the level of debt - particularly among female students. This week will see students finding out A-level results - and whether they have gained the grades needed for university. There have been suggestions of a more unpredictable clearing process this year for those who miss out on their grades this year. Top grades Universities have been given greater flexibility over how many top grade students they can recruit - with no limit on the number of places for students getting AAB A-level grades or better. A number of leading universities - including Oxford, Cambridge and Durham - are not planning to expand to recruit more of these students. But there are other universities, including Bristol and University College London (UCL), which are planning to use this flexibility and increase their intakes. But these extra places in Bristol and UCL will be made available to students who have already applied to these universities. What remains less certain is whether there will be a knock-on effect from this expansion at the top ability range - when the overall student numbers are not increasing. But there are many young people who find the clearing process \"baffling\", according to a survey from London South Bank University and the Student Room online forum. This found that almost half of A-level students were uncertain about the clearing system for allocating any remaining university places after results have been published. For students planning to study abroad in countries with lower tuition fees, growing demand looks set to mean higher grades this year. Maastricht University in Holland says that this year it will require at least three B grades at A-level - with almost 600 students from the UK applying for undergraduate courses, up from almost 300 last year. Earlier this week, the head of Universities UK warned against any \"predictions of chaos\" in the application and clearing process. \"The reality for most students is that 2012 will work no differently than previous years,\" said chief executive, Nicola Dandridge.", "summary": "有研究说由于英格兰大学学费太贵，今年学生对学校挑挑拣拣（choosy）。"}

It affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting. One of the main dangers is dehydration. Ebru Macavoy, 29, from London, had the same condition during her pregnancy in 2009. \"It was traumatic, debilitating, horrendous. I was constantly nauseous and vomiting 30 times a day.\" She said: \"I feel so sad for Kate that's she's going through this, I feel really sorry, it's so traumatic.\" At the time she was a trainee barrister, just a few months married and at the start of her first pregnancy. Ebru would wake up exhausted. \"From the moment I opened my eyes I was nauseous. If I turned in bed I would vomit, every time I moved I felt sick. \"I couldn't drive or go for a walk - all the simple tasks were absolutely impossible.\" She lost a lot of weight during this time going from a size 10 dress size to closer to a size six. Ebru, who now volunteers to help other people with the condition, says she was at the \"extreme end\" of hyperemesis. The vomiting never stopped during the pregnancy. However, drugs helped to control her symptoms until she was being sick only five or so times a day. Symptoms NHS Choices: Morning sickness When she gave birth to her son Ruben: \"As soon as I'd given birth it was gone.\" The severe nausea and vomiting continues throughout pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum needs specialist treatment and often requires a stay in hospital. Ebru said she was in hospital about 20 times during her pregnancy. One of the main dangers is dehydration as it can be difficult to keep enough fluid in the body. Twin link The condition is unlikely to cause any harm to the baby. However, there is a risk of the baby being born with a low birth weight if there is significant weight loss during the pregnancy. Dr Tim Draycott, a consultant obstetrician and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"With treatment - intravenous fluids and medication to control the vomiting and nausea - it's quite a benign condition although horrible to have. \"The real risk is under-treatment.\" Dr Draycott said the condition was linked to hormones in pregnancy and usually improved as levels went down after around 13 weeks. \"We are not sure why some women get it when others do not, but it is slightly more common if the mother is expecting twins.\" There are suggestions the condition is genetic, meaning multiple bouts of hyperemesis gravidarum is not uncommon. Rosie Dodds, from the National Childbirth Trust, said avoiding trigger smells, such as smoke or fatty foods, could help alleviate milder symptoms associated with the more typical pregnancy sickness. \"There is limited evidence, the use of ginger, vitamin B6 and acupressure have also been found to be effective for some women, though it's always worth checking with your midwife or doctor first. The traditional remedy of eating dry foods such as toast is unlikely to do any harm. \"We wish William and Catherine the best of luck with the pregnancy and hope that the duchess is feeling better soon.\"", "summary": "英国王室证实，剑桥公爵夫人凯特怀上了她的第二个孩子。"}

It says this may be because these pupils are more likely to get good exam results and to go to a top university. Ministers say reforms are \"closing the gap\" between rich and poor. About 7% of children in the UK are educated at independent schools. The SMF research uses data from the British Cohort Study, which tracks a representative sample of the UK population born in a specific week in 1970. The findings indicate that between the ages of 26 and 42 someone who attended a private school will earn around £193,700 more, on average, than an individual educated at a maintained school. A former private school pupil earns, on average, about 43% more per hour at the age of 34, about 35% more at 38 and 34% more at 42, it says. The study suggests that even when a child's parental background and their test scores at age 10 are taken into account, there is still a \"substantial earnings premium\", with a private school pupil earning an estimated £57,653 more between the ages of 26 and 42 than a similar child who went to a state school. The researchers conclude that, while a range of factors may have an impact on earnings, better educational achievement plays a major part. Private education Source: The Sutton Trust The report says: \"Those who go to independent schools are more likely to get good A-levels, more likely to get degrees and to get them from the most selective universities. \"Not only are their educational outcomes better but, on the best available evidence - value-added scores - independent schools (on average) progress their children more during their school years than state schools.\" Emran Mian, director of the SMF, said the results were not just because these children tended to come from privileged backgrounds. 'Inequitable' \"Take two people of the same ability at age 11 and with the same parental background, track them forward, and the pupil who attends independent school is likely to earn substantially more,\" he said. \"A significant driver appears to be simply that independent schools typically progress the education of pupils more during their school years than state schools. On this basis, limiting the opportunity to attend independent schools to those who are able to afford the high fees seems inequitable.\" The SMF findings come in a report assessing a proposal by the Sutton Trust that children should be admitted to independent schools on academic ability alone, rather than on their family's capacity to pay fees. The trust's Open Access scheme proposes that participating schools should receive the same funding per pupil as local state schools, but charge fees on a means-tested basis, with the poorest families paying nothing. Extending the scheme to 100 leading independent schools, covering 62,500 pupils, would cost the government about £215m per year, the study estimates. It says that if the initiative were introduced, with pupils selected on merit rather than ability to pay, the social make-up of these private schools would change radically. 'Recruit once again on merit' The number of children coming from the top 10% of household incomes would roughly halve, while the proportion of children coming from the bottom 40% would more than double. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"This report clearly sets out the advantages that can be gained from a good private education. \"We need to open those opportunities to more young people, transforming the independent sector to ensure that successful day schools recruit once again on merit rather than money. \"Forty years ago, most of the best independent day schools in this country were open to children of all backgrounds. Today, unless your parents can find £12,500 a year after tax, access is by and large denied.\" But the National Union of Teachers described the Open Access scheme as \"complete nonsense\". General secretary Christine Blower said: \"Social mobility will not be addressed by sending a few students from poorer backgrounds to independent schools. \"A five-year study in 2010 commissioned by the Sutton Trust and government showed that students from comprehensive schools are likely to achieve higher-class degrees at university than independent and grammar school students with similar A-levels and GCSE results. \"In March the Higher Education Funding Council tracked 130,000 students beginning degrees in 2007 - the results showed that state pupils were more likely to get a 2:1 than those who had been privately educated.\" A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Our reforms are closing the gap between the rich and poor and allowing thousands more children to go to good state schools. \"There are now a quarter of a million fewer pupils in failing secondary schools than there were in 2010, and more young people from disadvantaged areas in England are applying to university than ever before.\"", "summary": "英国一个研究发现，和公立学校学生相比，私校出身的年轻人在26至42岁的就业生涯之间，能多赚将近20万英镑。"}

To give away his entire multi-billion dollar fortune while he was still living. The 89-year-old American businessman has now achieved that, donating almost $9bn (£7bn) worldwide. And through his private foundation the Atlantic Philanthropies, Mr Feeney, born to Irish-American parents, gave $570m (£447m) to causes in Northern Ireland over four decades. Who is Chuck Feeney? Charles F Feeney was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1931, during the Great Depression. His mother worked as a hospital nurse and his father was an insurance underwriter. The philanthropist traces his family history back to County Fermanagh, where his grandmother was brought up close to the village of Kinawley. The entrepreneur made his money selling luxury duty free goods to travellers across the world, but he rejected the trappings of wealth himself. Conor O'Clery, who wrote a biography of Mr Feeney, said: \"He read and was very impressed by Carnegie's famous essay 'Wealth', which says such things as 'to die rich is to die disgraced'.\" He went on to found the Atlantic Philanthropies in 1982, an international organisation set up to distribute his fortune to good causes and projects that he supports around the world. The foundation's main areas of interest are health, education, reconciliation and human rights. For the first 15 years of his philanthropic mission, Mr Feeney donated money in secret leading to him being dubbed the James Bond of philanthropy, only emerging from anonymity in 1997. According to Mr O'Clery, his five children (four daughters and one son) have been left money through their mother, Mr Feeney's first wife. He now lives in a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco with his wife Helga, having travelled extensively to examine projects to donate to. NI's 'big bets' Queens University Belfast (QUB) was one of the biggest beneficiaries of Mr Feeney's grants from 1993-2015, being gifted a total of $132m (£83m). It also received the single biggest donation from the Atlantic Philanthropies, when it was gifted $24m (£15m) in 2012. It was for the university's Institute of Health Sciences Centre for Experimental Medicine. Nathalie Trott, from Queen's, said the grants had \"changed the lives\" of students and had provided the university with \"state of the art facilities.\" \"The doors of the Atlantic Philanthropies may have closed in Belfast, but Chuck Feeney's legacy will live on for generations.\" Integrated education Another cornerstone of Mr Feeney's philanthropy in Northern Ireland has been the promotion of integrated education in the pursuit of reconciliation and peace building. Down through the decades, it is understood about £8m has been gifted to the Integrated Education Fund for various projects and the area is listed as the first sector funded in NI by the Atlantic Philanthropies back in 1991. One of the schools that benefitted from hundreds of thousands of pounds is Rowandale Integrated Primary School in Moira. Principal Frances Hughes said Rowandale would not be in existence today without Atlantic Philanthropies' support. \"In 2007, when the school opened, enrolment began with 18 children and this year we have an enrolment of over 300,\" she said. \"The pupils here would have had absolutely no idea (about Chuck Feeney's role) - I would love to tell them that story though and I think they would really enjoy it.\" Since 1996, when the Integrated Education Fund received their first grant from the Atlantic Philanthropies, there were a total of 33 integrated schools, which had risen to 62 by the time their funding drew to a close in 2014. The funding has helped to establish 21 integrated primary and eight secondary-level schools and in those 18 years, pupil numbers overall have risen from 7,000 to 22,000. Christopher Oechsli, president of the Atlantic Philanthropies, said it was \"an honour\" to support so many projects in Northern Ireland since first beginning its operations here in 1991. \"It's heartening to see the progress made and the way groups Atlantic supported continue to drive change in these challenging times,\" he said. \"That's the legacy.\" According to biographer Conor O'Clery, Chuck Feeney is \"very happy\" that he has now completed his almost 40-year mission and celebrated the milestone with wife Helga.", "summary": "对多数人来说，能成为一名亿万富翁可能是人生成就的最高点，同时也是一个难以企及的梦想。"}

Many of the pieces by late 20th Century and contemporary Chinese artists have never been seen in public. The works will be displayed on rotation at the Ashmolean in a gallery dedicated to Sullivan and his wife Khoan. Some of the paintings have been loaned to the museum since 2000. They were collected by the couple on their extensive travels to China from the 1940s. Much of the art was gained by the pair directly from the artists, and as gifts from those they made friends with. Among the most significant paintings are by Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian, who both died in the mid-20th Century, and also include more recent acquisitions, including Landscript by Xu Bing, which was created in 2002. Sullivan retired to Oxford in 1985 after a career as the leading scholar on Chinese art outside the country. He continued to work in the field until shortly before his death, and was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the American Friends of Shanghai Museum in 2012. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz called the new acquisition \"an extraordinary gift\", adding that modern Chinese art is now the \"hottest ticket in town\". Curator of the collection, Dr Shelagh Vainker, said Sullivan collected through the 20th Century in every style. \"He kept with it all the way and was still acquiring pieces this year,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

This adds a great deal of context to the works and how they were acquired over the decades. \"As a package, it's not just just the leading collection in the West, it's a unique resource for the whole subject,\" she said. \"The whole field of Chinese art has exploded in the last decade,\" added Dr Vainker. Professor Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean, said he hoped the paintings will be \"enjoyed by thousands of visitors and scholars from around the world\". \"We hope this is a fitting testament to a great art historian and collector,\" he added.", "summary": "牛津大学的阿什莫林博物馆宣布，接受中国艺术研究学者萨利文教授遗留下来的中国艺术品捐赠。"}

More people have died in the US and several European countries than in China where the virus emerged. The US and the UK have also cast doubt on China's figures and the speed with which it responded or alerted others. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's measures. Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than 145,000 have died. The US,France, Italy and Spain are amongst the worst affected countries. What's behind this French-Chinese confrontation? France has seen 141,000 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths. China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted. Local officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate. President Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes. The article - by an unnamed diplomat - was seen by France as a reference to the situation in its care homes, which make up a large number of deaths attributed to the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. China dismissed the row as a \"misunderstanding\". Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic \"and has no intention of making any\". Mr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed. \"Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this,\" he said. \"We don't know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about.\" He said that abandoning freedoms to fight the pandemic would threaten Western democracies. \"We can't accept that. You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis.\" What is China being accused of? Many Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. The UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that \"hard questions\" would have be asked about how the outbreak started \"and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier\". He said there would have to be a \"deep dive\" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be \"business as usual\" after the crisis. US President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China. On Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: \"Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?\" he said, naming China. He said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city. Fox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols. The Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials sent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab. US intelligence agencies have taken an interest, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said on Tuesday. \"We've had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain.\" There is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus was released accidentally from a lab, says the BBC's science editor Paul Rincon. One online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, who note that studies show the virus originated in animals - most likely in bats.", "summary": "法国总统马克龙（Emmanuel Macron）早前接受英国传媒访问时批评，中国在抗击新冠肺炎疫情时有所隐瞒，又说外界称赞中国处理疫情手法有进步的说法是“天真”。"}

Russia's president will be among world leaders marking the Armistice in Paris. Mr Macron has already proposed a joint intervention force for crisis missions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the idea of an intervention force in June, but said it would have to be part of \"the structure of defence co-operation\". The UK, while in favour of such a joint force, is opposed to a European army, because of the potential risk of creating a parallel structure to Nato. President Macron has already warned that Europeans can no longer rely on the US to defend them, and he revived the theme on Tuesday, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 1987 nuclear treaty with Russia, banning medium-range ground-launched missiles. \"Who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\" he told French radio station Europe 1. \"I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States.\" Speaking about cyber security, he also said: \"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\" Will there be a European army? By Defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus There is no evidence that any group of European countries has the political will or economic muscle to spend sufficiently on defence to make up for the United States' raw power. Indeed the deployment of troops \"into harm's way\" remains the ultimate sovereign decision of a national government. There is no \"Nato army\" today - merely an alliance of national components trained and accustomed to operating together. President Macron's call for a greater European effort in defence derives from two sets of factors: his support for the greater European project on the one hand, but also horror at much that the Trump Administration is doing on the other, with its overturning of treaties and so on. But could Europe really stand up to Russia alone? And what of the longer-term threat from China? The US relationship may be problematic but it could be becoming more important than ever. President Macron's battlefield tour will take in the River Somme as well as Verdun. 'Ultra-liberal Europe' Last week he warned of the \"leprosy\" of nationalism spreading worldwide and declared that he had been struck by the similarities of current times and the period between World War One and World War Two. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will join Mr Macron on Friday at the Somme while President Trump will join dozens of world leaders for Sunday's ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. During his interview on Tuesday, Mr Macron warned that there was anger against a \"too ultra-liberal Europe that no longer allows our middle classes a decent living\". He spoke of Europe that was becoming increasingly fractured and singled out the UK's vote to leave the EU as part of that disenchantment. President Macron's opponents have accused him of being out of touch with the everyday problems of French voters, and have called for a national protest against higher fuel taxes on France's roads on 17 November. The latest opinion poll ahead of May 2019 European Parliament elections suggests Mr Macron's LREM party is trailing the far-right National Rally party for the first time.

They are wanted on suspicion of violating a new security law imposed in Hong Kong by Beijing, Chinese state TV reported, calling them \"troublemakers\". Hong Kong police declined to comment. The development comes after legislative elections scheduled for September were delayed for a year by Hong Kong's government on Friday. It said the move was necessary because of a spike in Covid-19 infections, but the opposition accused it of using the pandemic as a pretext. The White House said the move undermined democracy. Pro-democracy politicians had hoped to capitalise on anger in the Chinese territory about the new security law to win a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo). Many in Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997, fear that unique freedoms meant to be guaranteed until 2047 are under serious threat. The UK and Australia are among countries that have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in recent weeks. Germany did so on Friday - one of those reported to be on the new \"wanted list\" has received asylum there. Who are the 'wanted'? Chinese state TV network CCTV said six people were wanted on suspicion of inciting secession or colluding with foreign forces - both crimes can be punished with up to life in prison under the new security law. The six, according to CCTV and Hong Kong media, are: Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who was recently granted political asylum in Britain. He was detained last August while on a business trip to mainland China and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong. He denies that and says he was beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in Chinese custody. Responding to news of the arrest warrant, Mr Cheng told the BBC that he would not stop speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. \"The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour,\" he said. Nathan Law, 27, a high-profile activist who has fled to the UK. \"I have no idea what is my 'crime' and I don't think that's important. Perhaps I love Hong Kong too much,\" he said on Twitter. Mr Law first came to prominence as a student protest leader in 2014. He said he was disappointed and frightened to have to live in exile, and that he was going to have to \"sever\" his relationship with his family in Hong Kong. Samuel Chu, a US citizen. He is the son of Reverend Chu Yiu Ming, a Baptist minister who was one of the founders of the 2014 \"Umbrella Movement\". Mr Chu runs the Washington DC-based Hong Kong Democracy Council and said he last visited Hong Kong in November 2019. \"I might be the first non-Chinese citizen to be targeted, but I will not be the last. If I am targeted, any American and any citizen of any nation who speaks out for Hong Kong can, and will be, too,\" he said. The national security law carries extraterritorial provisions that say anyone, including non-Hong Kong residents, can be charged under it. China says the law is necessary to restore stability and order in the global financial hub. Ray Wong, a pro-independence activist who fled to Germany in 2017 and is now in Britain, told the BBC that the list of \"wanted\" exiles had been drawn up to \"intimidate\" pro-democracy activists who are trying to drum up international support for their cause. Honcques Laus, an 18-year-old now in the UK, first came to prominence in November 2017 when he brandished a pro-independence banner next to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. \"Come arrest me in the UK,\" he was quoted - as Lau Hong - as telling a journalist on Friday. Wayne Chan, another pro-independence activist, is in an undisclosed country. \"For me, the situation faced by Hong Kongers is even more dangerous than what I face.

'Not an attack' Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that public's personal information was safe and and stressed the \"unblemished record\" of the ABS. \"The one thing that is absolutely crystal clear is that there was no penetration of the ABS website,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"What you saw was the denial of service attack or a denial of service attempt which, as you know, is designed to prevent access to a website as opposed to getting into the server behind it.

Most of the posts focused on divisive social and political messages. Facebook released the figures ahead of a Senate hearing where it, together with Twitter and Google. will detail Russia's impact on the popular sites. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations that it attempted to influence the last US presidential election, in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. In a separate development on Monday, an investigation by independent counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia produced its first charges against two former aides. It also emerged that a third former aide had pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI. President Trump has dismissed allegations of collusion with Moscow, and has repeatedly called on Mrs Clinton to be investigated. What is Facebook saying? Facebook says some 80,000 posts were published between June 2015 and August 2017 and were seen by about 29 million Americans directly, according to a draft of prepared remarks seen by US media ahead of Tuesday's Senate judiciary committee hearing. These posts, which Facebook says were created by a Kremlin-linked company, were amplified through likes, shares and comments and spread to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had deleted 170 Instagram accounts, which posted about 120,000 pieces of content. \"These actions run counter to Facebook's mission of building community and everything we stand for,\" wrote Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch. \"And we are determined to do everything we can to address this new threat.\" In a blog post from earlier this month, Facebook's Elliot Schrage said that many of the posts did not violate the company's content policies. They were removed, he said, because they were inauthentic - the Russians behind the posts did not identify themselves as such. What defines reach? A post counts as reaching someone when it's shown in Facebook News Feeds, so this figure takes no account of the number of people who may or may not have actually read it. We do not know therefore how many of those 126 million people actually consumed the 80,000 posts and consequently how many of these were influential in terms of affecting voters. Clearly, a mass targeting of posts can have a subliminal impact on people but it is hard to evaluate with any certainty based on the data we have seen so far. What did the fake accounts post? For now, Facebook, Twitter and Google have opted not to make the suspected Russian-backed ads and accounts public. However, several purported examples have been been identified by others. One is a Facebook page called Heart of Texas. Many of its early posts were innocuous memes designed to appeal to patriotic locals. But once it had attracted thousands of followers, it began claiming a victory for Hillary Clinton would attract \"refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks\". Another case involved the appropriation of the name of a long-established Muslim group, which then posted false claims about Senator John McCain funding the Islamic State group. Other examples masqueraded as being from gun-rights campaigners, gay rights supporters, Black Lives Matter activists and dog-lovers. Even Twitter's chief executive is alleged to have retweeted one account that celebrated Women's History Month before it changed tack after gaining influence to claim Clinton had received money from the Ku Klux Klan. What about other social media sites? Google also revealed on Monday that Russian trolls had uploaded more than 1,000 political videos on YouTube on 18 different channels. The company said they had very low view counts and there was no evidence they had been targeting American viewers. Meanwhile, Twitter found and suspended all 2,752 accounts that it had tracked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, Reuters quotes a source as saying. These accounts, which have now been suspended, posted about 131,000 tweets between September 2016 and November 2016. All three companies are also due to testify on Wednesday at the Senate and House intelligence committees. Key recent developments: Getting short shrift Dave Lee, BBC technology reporter, San Francisco It's quite staggering how this problem, dismissed just over a year ago by Mark Zuckerberg as \"crazy\" talk, has exploded into a crisis at the world's biggest social network. Apparently not learning from that mistake, we understand that the thrust of Facebook's message to various government committees this week will be that just one in 23,000 or so messages shared on the network were from the Russians. It should not surprise Facebook if such a statement - an engineer's defence, you might say - gets short shrift from a panel already unsatisfied with some of what it's heard from the companies so far. You won't see Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey or Google's executives answering questions this week. That job will be left up to their lawyers. You wonder how long tech's great and powerful can get away with not personally standing up for the companies they built. Follow Dave on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC What is happening with the Russia inquiry? Meanwhile, the White House on Monday sought to downplay the arrest of President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and aide Rick Gates on money-laundering charges unrelated to the 2016 campaign. Another of Mr Trump's campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over his contacts with Russia in the first such indictments by Robert Mueller's special counsel investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Papadopoulos had been working in a \"volunteer position\" and \"no activity was done in an official capacity\". Analysts say Mr Papadopoulos's case has the potential to damage the US leader, and that he may have been helping Mr Mueller's inquiries since his arrest in July - which was not made public until Monday.

After their pet dies, cat lovers in the community will then not be allowed to get any more. It sounds extreme, but it may be something more communities should be considering: after all, cats are responsible for the death of billions of birds and mammals each year - and, according to some, it is all our fault. Dr Peter Marra, the head of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Centre, has authored journals and books on the issue. Contrary to preconceptions about him, he insists he is not anti-cat or against cat ownership. \"Cats make wonderful pets - they're spectacular pets! But they shouldn't be allowed to roam outside - it's a really obvious solution,\" he told the BBC. \"We would never let dogs do that. It's about time we treat cats like dogs.\" In Omaui, officials say the measure is justified because cameras have shown roaming cats preying on birds, insects and reptiles in the area. \"So your cat can live out its natural life at Omaui happily doing what it's doing. But then when it dies, you wouldn't be able to replace it,\" bio-security operations manager Ali Meade explained. Under the plan, anyone not complying would receive a notice, before officials would remove the pets - but only as an \"absolute last resort\". The initiative is part of the regional council's proposed regional pest management plan, which was opened for consultation on Tuesday. John Collins, chairman of the Omaui Landcare Charitable Trust, championed the ban to protect \"high-value\" nature reserves there. 'We're not cat haters, but we want our environment to be wildlife-rich,\" he said, the Otago Daily Times reports. How big a problem are cats? The debate about cat populations and local eco-systems is not unique to Omaui. Conservation scientists have long warned about the impact of feral and outdoor cats on the global eco system - and they've been ranked among the 100 worst non-native invasive species in the world. Dr Marra says 63 species extinctions around the world are now linked to the booming cat populations. The problem is exacerbated in areas with very sensitive eco-systems, like New Zealand. \"It sounds extreme,\" he says. \"But the situation has got out of control.\" He believes cat-lovers around the world need to embrace a \"different mind-set\" toward the animals. He believes they should be adopted where possible, then neutered and exercised at home using toys, or in a controlled environment - for example, on a leash. \"This predicament is not the fault of cats - it's humans' fault,\" he insists. Because of their popularity on social media and in memes, the global pet population shows no sign of abating. \"They are just cute - everything about them, which makes this whole thing more difficult.\" Accurate estimates are hard to ascertain, but in the US there are about 86 million pet cats - roughly one in every three households. Unquantifiable amounts live stray or feral, meaning huge casualties in the environment. It is estimated that as many as four billion birds and 22 billion mammals are killed by cats in the US every year. Even in the UK, populations are on the decline, and experts blame cats. The Mammal Society says that about 55 million birds are falling casualty each year. 'Natural-born killers' It's not the first time cats have been painted as a menace in New Zealand - a country boasting a feline in almost half its households. They're a hot issue in Australia too, where feral and outdoor cats are blamed for millions of native species' deaths every night. The nation has been funding grassroots culling initiatives since 2015, boasts the world's largest cat-proof fence and has even considered introducing a national curfew for domestic cats. Councils and state governments have been taking the cat problem into their own hands - forcing cats to stay indoors at night, implementing household quotas and mandatory identification and neutering. Nevertheless, initiatives against felines remain controversial. Last year animal rights groups laid particular scorn at one Queensland local council who were offering $10 bounties for feral cat scalps. In Omaui, residents told local media they were \"shocked\" and \"hoodwinked\" by the proposed ban and have vowed to resist it. Nico Jarvis, a local resident who says her three cats help combat rodents in her house, compared the proposal to a \"police state\". ''It's not even regulating people's ability to have a cat. It's saying you can't have a cat,'' she told the Otago Daily Times. Paw Justice, a New Zealand-based non-profit that focuses on animal abuse, posted about the plan on Facebook, questioning the evidence behind it. Cat-lovers on the group's Facebook page reacted angrily to the news and pointing out that poisons, cars and humans also damage native species. Local residents have until the end of October to register their submissions to Environment Southland's plan. You may also like:", "summary": "猫一直是广受人们欢迎的动物，但是新西兰南部海岸边的一座村庄为保护当地野生动物，正计划推行禁猫令，引发争议。"}

Most are Rohingya Muslims who cannot go back to Myanmar, also known as Burma, where they are not recognised as citizens of the country and are regularly persecuted. Some of those who are adrift in the Andaman Sea have been provided with food, water and medicine by the Thai navy. It is not clear how many other boats are in a similar predicament.

Other banners prepared by the host country featured the official slogan of Cambodia's year in the chair of Asean: \"One Community, One Destiny\". That has an awfully hollow ring to it now. For the first time in the association's 45-year history, the foreign ministers from the 10 member countries were unable to agree on a closing statement. For all the high-profile security, pomp and ceremony, it was as if the bewilderingly-titled events (the \"45th AMM/ PMC/ 19th ARF/ 2nd EAS FMM\") had never happened officially. The reason: China. Four Asean members are in dispute with Beijing over the sovereignty of the South China Sea - with the Philippines and Vietnam involved in particularly tense arguments. But the poorest of the association's members have received billions of dollars in aid and investment from China in recent years. And - fairly or not - during Cambodia's time in the Asean chair, it has faced accusations of doing Beijing's bidding rather than supporting its colleagues. Cambodia has tried - as far as possible - to keep the South China Sea issue off the agenda of Asean meetings. Its refusal to allow a reference to the Philippines' dispute with China stymied attempts to issue a closing statement following last week's meetings. It seemed to confirm the worst fears of diplomats about Asean's vulnerability to conflicts of interest caused by China's influence in the region. With the United States also attempting to increase its engagement, Asean risks being caught in the middle. \"A great game is being played in this part of the world,\" said Japan's ambassador to Asean, Kimihiro Ishikane. \"For Asean to play an important role, it must keep its centrality - its mind-set of independence.\" 'Balancing act' That is easier said than done. Comparisons are sometimes made between Asean and the European Union - especially as the former moves towards greater economic integration. But the differences between, say, Greece and Germany are nothing compared to the yawning chasm between Laos - one of the poorest countries in the world - and Singapore, which is one of the wealthiest. Finding common ground is sometimes a challenge - and countries like Cambodia may feel that China can offer them more assistance in development than their neighbours. So Asean is in a tricky position. Its rising economic clout has led to increasing interest from the rest of the world. And since the adoption of a charter four years ago - which makes its decisions binding - it has been taken more seriously as an international player. But this is attracting attention which has the potential to split its membership. The association's secretary general, Surin Pitsuwan, told the BBC that Asean was now strong enough to deal with it. \"This region has become more important to the world - they don't want it to be derailed, they don't want any conflict to affect the growth trajectory of this region. We are more important to the world than five years ago,\" said Dr Surin. \"We knew the game all along - we need to play this balancing act. We need to serve as a fulcrum of all sorts of power plays in the region. We can't keep anybody out - because everybody has legitimate interests in the stability and security of this region.\" But if it is indeed a balancing act, then last week Asean took a tumble - raising serious questions about its future. As the largest member, Indonesia was quick to move to heal the wounds. Its foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, has embarked on a round of what he calls \"shuttle diplomacy\" - an effort to patch things up among the quarrelling members. Following visits to Manila and Hanoi, Mr Natalegawa arrived in Phnom Penh to try to agree a common stance on the South China Sea issue. \"Last week wasn't a pleasant experience - it was very un-Asean, the lack of consensus,\" he told the BBC. \"But Indonesia believes we can have more influence if we are united. We need to quickly get ourselves back on track.\" Mr Natalegawa said he was confident the members would reaffirm their unity. The problem, he said, had been with details of specific incidents being included in a statement - rather than a deeper philosophical split. \"Let's not labour on the specific incidents - but build the capacity of Asean to deal with these incidents.\" Above all, Mr Natalegawa hopes that last week's events in Phnom Penh will prove to be an \"aberration\" rather than a new norm for the association. He points to Asean's role in cooling the tensions at the Thai-Cambodia border as evidence of how successful it can be in forging consensus. But now there can be no doubt about the main challenges to Asean's chances of becoming a serious geo-political player. As the \"great game\" warms up, its community will be tested - and its destiny remains in the balance.", "summary": "“欢迎光临奇迹王国”，金边机场的招牌如是说。"}

Set in a small-town community in the West Country, it centres on the unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother, which shocks the local villagers. Rowling said she was \"thrilled\" that the novel has been commissioned. \"I always felt that, if it were to be adapted, this novel was best suited to television and I think the BBC is the perfect home.\" BBC One controller Danny Cohen said he was excited to bring Rowling's latest work to audiences. \"[Her] story-telling is of course peerless in its popularity, and I am looking forward to collaborating with her,\" he said.

Suspects have been arrested over the attack but just two gunmen were thought to have assaulted the museum. The news comes after a video was released of the pair roaming the Bardo. Mr Essebsi said it was clear there had been three attackers, because they had \"been identified and filmed on surveillance cameras\". \"We've asked the people to help [find the third attacker] because the people are interested in this.\" He added in an interview with French media that a monument would be erected in memory of the victims. Lyse Doucet: Tunisia's test of transition Upsurge in extremism The gunmen are said to have been trained in Libya in an area controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants. IS has said it was behind the attack on the museum, which is situated next to the country's parliament. The two gunmen seen in the video were named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui. They were both killed in a gunfight with security forces inside the building. In an earlier interview with Paris Match, Mr Essebsi said that \"shortcomings\" in Tunisia's security system meant \"the police and intelligence services had not been thorough enough in protecting the museum\". However, he added that the security services \"reacted very efficiently\" to the attack and had helped save dozens of lives. Twenty foreigners were among those killed in the attack, including British, Japanese, French, Italian and Colombian tourists. Following the attack, large numbers of Tunisians gathered outside the museum to protest against terrorism. Tunisia has seen an upsurge in Islamist extremism since the 2011 revolution that ousted dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring. The leader of Tunisia's moderate Islamist party, Ennadha, says the country will continue to be under threat of attack as long as neighbouring Libya remains unstable. Rached Ghannouchi told the BBC that IS would not be able to establish a foothold in Tunisia itself but young men were being armed in Libya and crossing borders that were hard to control. On Saturday, the brother of Yassine Laabidi, one of the gunmen, said Laabidi had been \"brainwashed by swines who send young men to their death in the name of religion\".", "summary": "突尼斯总统周日（22日）说，造成20余人死亡的博物馆枪击案中的第三名攻击者目前“仍然在逃”。"}

The argument was further complicated after its owner refused to sell. But Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said a committee of experts had decided that the house should be demolished, reported Austrian newspaper Die Presse. A new building put in its place will be used for administrative or for charitable purposes, the paper added (in German). \"The Hitler house will be torn down. The foundations can remain but a new building will be erected. It will be be used by either a charity or the local authorities,\" Mr Sobotka told Die Presse. The house has been the subject of years of legal wrangling between the owner Gerlinde Pommer and the government, which has been renting it since 1972 to prevent any misuse. It currently pays about €4,800 ($5,300; £4,336) a month for the building in Braunau am Inn . Ms Pommer who is now retired, has repeatedly refused to sell the three-storey building to the government. For the last five years it has also stood empty, as she refused to allow renovation work to be done. The building had previously been used as a centre for people with disabilities. An interior ministry spokesman told AFP a legal amendment proposed earlier this year which would allow them to seize the property was still \"under way\", meaning parliament has yet to approve the demolition. However, the decision will likely upset some in the community, some who wanted it to become a refugee centre, others a museum dedicated to Austria's liberation from Nazi rule. A number of cultural organisations previously opposed the building's demolition because it is part of the historic city centre and therefore under heritage protection. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building, near the Austro-German border, on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists. But as the Nazis began to lose control in 1944, it was shut up. Yet despite the efforts of successive governments to stop it drawing neo-Nazis sympathisers to Braunau am Inn, locals say it still does. \"I've even witnessed people from Italy or from France coming here… for adoration purposes,\" Josef Kogler, a teacher in Braunau, told the BBC. \"One Frenchman, a history teacher I think it was, came and asked me for Hitler's birthplace… It's hard to understand.\"", "summary": "奥地利政府将征用年阿道夫·希特勒出生的旧居，防止其变成新纳粹朝圣的场所。"}

You have to attend an all-day class, take a written exam and pass a shooting-range test with a mark of at least 95%. There are also mental health and drugs tests. Your criminal record is checked and police look for links to extremist groups. Then they check your relatives too - and even your work colleagues. And as well as having the power to deny gun licences, police also have sweeping powers to search and seize weapons. That's not all. Handguns are banned outright. Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. The law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan's 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit. Police must be notified where the gun and the ammunition are stored - and they must be stored separately under lock and key. Police will also inspect guns once a year. And after three years your licence runs out, at which point you have to attend the course and pass the tests again. This helps explain why mass shootings in Japan are extremely rare. When mass killings occur, the killer most often wields a knife. My Perfect Country In a world where a lot is going wrong there is also a lot going right. So what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in ideas around the world that have been truly successful? The current gun control law was introduced in 1958, but the idea behind the policy dates back centuries. \"Ever since guns entered the country, Japan has always had strict gun laws,\" says Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence and the author of Gun Baby Gun. \"They are the first nation to impose gun laws in the whole world and I think it laid down a bedrock saying that guns really don't play a part in civilian society.\" People were being rewarded for giving up firearms as far back as 1685, a policy Overton describes as \"perhaps the first ever gun buyback initiative\". The result is a very low level of gun ownership - 0.6 guns per 100 people in 2007, according to the Small Arms Survey, compared to 6.2 in England and Wales and 88.8 in the US. \"The moment you have guns in society, you will have gun violence but I think it's about the quantity,\" says Overton. \"If you have very few guns in society, you will almost inevitably have low levels of violence.\" Japanese police officers rarely use guns and put much greater emphasis on martial arts - all are expected to become a black belt in judo. They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms. \"The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015],\" says journalist Anthony Berteaux. \"What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down.\" Overton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been \"to militarise the police\". \"If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals,\" he says. To underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift. The care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces. Journalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing. \"One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell,\" he says. There is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. \"A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again,\" he explains. \"People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace.\" In fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters. \"It is unknown territory,\" says political science professor Koichi Nakano. \"Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?\" According to Iain Overton, the \"almost taboo level of rejection\" of guns in Japan means that the country is \"edging towards a perfect place\" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership. Henrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as \"a civil liberty\", and rejecting the idea of firearms as \"something you use to defend your property against others\". But for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country. \"The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna,\" says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. \"But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside.\" Join the conversation - find the BBC World Service on Facebook and Twitter.

Internal IS documents acquired by the team show \"command responsibility\" for numerous atrocities. The group has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. Working in strict secrecy, the team of experts has spent all year actively investigating commanders, emirs and provincial governors for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The atrocities alleged to have been committed by those in their ranks include kidnappings, beheadings, crucifixions, torture and summary executions. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama vowed to destroy the group after it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The group has carried out several more beheadings, including that of another US journalist, James Foley, and Kurdish fighters. Mr Obama's comments came as campaign group Human Rights Watch said it had uncovered new sites of Islamic State mass killings in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. The militants are believed to have murdered more than 500 Iraqi soldiers after taking over a large Iraqi army base in June. Building a case against IS The highly experienced war crimes investigators, working out of a nondescript headquarters in a European city, have avoided all publicity until now. But in an interview with the BBC, they revealed that they were being funded by the UK Government to the tune of $70,000 (£43,000) a month and employ sources both in Syria and in the neighbouring countries. \"We would like to see the murderers of James Foley brought to justice,\" the chief investigator told the BBC. \"Having said that, those particular offenders and others like them are not the focus of our investigations.\" \"What we are after are the highest-level members of IS because these individuals are just as responsible for the countless murders as those men who kill with their own hands,\" he added. \"Indeed, those leaders are more responsible because they don't kill one person or two people. They are responsible for all the killings.\" The team has boxes of evidence smuggled out of Syria, consisting of documents, memory sticks and witness testimonies. They even have the actual minutes of an Islamic State provincial meeting that goes into such detail as forbidding their guards in Aleppo province to sleep in after 07:30. The investigators have managed to build up an intricate picture of how IS is run, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed caliph, at the top. Directly beneath him are four advisory councils: Sharia (Islamic Law), Shura, Military and Security, with the latter two being the most powerful. This one-plus-four structure is then duplicated down the chain of command, right down to local level. The investigators' command structure document is available as a download: The team say the number of foreign recruits to IS has surged since it declared itself a caliphate in the summer, with estimates of their total strength having been revised upwards from around 10,000 to near 30,000. There is a wide diversity in capability, the team says, with Tunisians and Chechens being among the most valued footsoldiers for their aggression and experience on the battlefield. British recruits With a few exceptions, investigators believe that British jihadists tend to cross the border from Turkey into Syria with no military experience and very little religious knowledge. After three months in a safe house getting basic military training and indoctrination, they are assigned tasks and roles. \"By and large the Westerners are given menial or low-level tasking by the emirs [the commanders],\" said another of the investigators, \"because they tend to arrive with no discernable battlefield skills. \"So its assumed they're better off providing support services to the group as they are unlikely to have either the religious or military expertise IS is looking for,\" he added. The investigators have put together a diagram showing links between al-Baghdadi and some named individuals. Despite their apparent role in the recent murders of the two American journalists, no British jihadists are thought to have reached any senior positions within Islamic State. Around half the estimated 500-600 who have travelled to Syria are now thought to be back in the UK. The team has reached the conclusion that IS is a far more structured and disciplined organisation than was previously thought. \"Our breakthrough came maybe two or three months ago when we looked at all the evidence that we'd gathered to date,\" the chief investigator told the BBC. \"We realised what we were looking at was not a militant organisation, we were witnessing the process of nation-building.\" \"That includes the provision of services, looking after the population - there is a military element of course but IS is just what it says, it is not a one-off phenomenon. They are building an Islamic state in the desert.\" The investigators say they expect some of their most important case files to be complete by the end of this year. But the team admits that bringing any of the suspects to trial will be almost impossible at present because they are hard to find and well protected. There is also the problem of legal jurisdiction as the team's remit runs only to Syria, not Iraq, and they say there is, at present, no court yet ready to try them.", "summary": "一个由英国政府出资成立的国际调查小组正在收集伊斯兰国领导人犯下战争罪行的证据。"}

We asked women from UCL to tell us about their experiences, why they chose science and whether women really do cry in labs. Natsuko Macabuag, 31, is a PhD student at the department of Neuroscience, Pharmacology and Physiology I was hugely influenced by my teachers to study science at GCSE and A-Level. I liked biology and chemistry and so a degree in biochemistry seemed a perfect option. I really believe that any positions in science should be based on ability rather than anything else and, from my experience, biosciences have a fairly even gender balance, especially when compared to other areas like engineering for example. I haven't faced any specific discrimination but I do think it can be harder for women if they have to take time off for maternity leave. It can slow your career progression and make it harder to move up. And no, women don't go around crying in the lab. I've seen more men getting angry and frustrated than I have women crying over a stressful job. Martha Robinson, 25, is a PhD student at the Institute of Ophthalmology I've never been told that I don't belong in science but I do think women are treated differently within the sector. There are so few women at the very top and I think progression is really hard. Women's competencies are often described differently. You hear a lot of \"proficient\" and \"good at experiments\" rather then \"highly intelligent and insightful\", which men get and suggest someone is more professor-level. I once worked on some programming and a male professor suggested \"you could make it pink\". I also went to a conference that had encouraged more women to attend but many men saw it that we were only there because we were women and not because we were as good as them. I was just quite shocked about how blatant they were about saying those things to us. I also think women have a hard time challenging what their seniors say about them, as the industry is so dependent on recommendations and I don't think women feel comfortable challenging them. It can make women's aspirations more limited if they see that it is going to be much tougher for them. Shu Ho, 23, is studying for an MA in Pharmacology I went to a school that specialised in maths and science and when I started the line of boys was much longer than the line of girls. But by the time I left six years later it was much more even, so changes have happened even in a short time. There are so many career opportunities for women in science and I don't feel at this stage that anything is off limits. I've personally always enjoyed labs where there is more of a balance of men and women, as they can be much more productive and nicer environments but really I think it's much more down to personality than it is to gender. Dr Hiranya Peiris is a cosmologist and reader in astronomy I always wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up and was really into science from a young age. My parents were both civil engineers, and growing up in Sri Lanka studying physics and maths was never seen as a boys thing to do. But since then I've had very different experiences. I see girls in my groups who are much less confident than boys, even though often they are much better students. I think it's from decades of these attitudes being reinforced. It's not from outright incidences of sexism but 1,000 small cuts that all add up. After I made an appearance on the BBC's Newsnight talking about astronomy a newspaper columnist suggested I was only on the programme because I was a woman. It hadn't even crossed my mind that anyone would think that and it was so upsetting. At the moment a few exceptional and hardy women make it to the top of my field of research but a lot of women leak out of the pipeline along the way. I really believe that equality will only be reached when average women get the same opportunities that average men do. Dr Helen Wilson, 42, is an applied mathematician I always knew I wanted to do a maths degree. My school was pretty good at encouraging me and I never felt it was something I was being persuaded against, but then I've also never really felt the need to conform, so maybe that's why I just stuck with what I was determined to do. I did notice the gender difference when I got to university though. About a quarter of the people on my undergraduate degree course were female and the proportions went down and down after that, which makes you more aware you are in the minority. There are just as many career opportunities for women in this area but I wonder if the perception is very different or whether it comes down to a confidence issue among some women. I have two young children but I've always found it to be a very family friendly career. I am in a research job, so my hours are more flexible, but I know this isn't the case for women who work in lab science where it isn't always that easy. I didn't take off a huge amount of time when I had my children. Research can move on quite quickly and I was aware of that and it wasn't always easy getting back into work.", "summary": "英国诺贝尔医学奖得主蒂姆·亨特爵士(Sir Tim Hunt)因说“女孩很麻烦”的言论，已经辞去在英国一所大学的名誉教授职位。"}

UK-wide census-based population estimates, including Scotland, will be released in December 2012. More people The population of England and Wales has risen by 3.7 million in a decade, up to 56.1 million, the census shows. It is the largest growth shown by any census since they began in 1801. The growth was fuelled by increased life expectancy, a rise in fertility rates and migration, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Ageing population The figures also indicate the population is ageing, with the median age rising to 39 in 2011 from 35 in 2001. The percentage of the population aged 65 and over was the highest seen in any census at 16.4% - or one in six people. The number of people over the age of 90 also went up. There were 430,000 residents within their 10th decade in 2011, compared with 340,000 in 2001 and 13,000 in 1911. The census showed that higher percentages of people aged 65 and over lived along the coast of England, in the south west, south east and east. Eastern European emigration European population growth between 2001 and 2011 differed greatly between countries. While some, such as Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain and England, saw big increases, others, mainly in eastern Europe, experienced population losses. Latvia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, Hungary, Estonia, Germany and Poland all saw their populations decrease. Regional differences Although all of the wider regions of England and Wales saw population growth in the last decade, within those regions some local authorities saw theirs decline. The biggest population growth was seen in London's Tower Hamlets (up 26.4%) and Newham (up 23.5%), while Manchester showed the third highest growth - up 19%. Overall, 10 of the 20 authorities with the highest percentage growth were in London. The 19 most densely populated authorities were also in London. In contrast, almost half of the local authorities with a declining population were in north-west England, and a further four were in north-east England. The ONS suggested this could be, in part, down to the decline in traditional manufacturing industries in these areas.", "summary": "根据2011年人口普查结果，英格兰与威尔士人口增加许多。"}

Dr Alex George is an A&E doctor and former Love Island contestant. Alix Fox is a sex journalist, presenter of BBC Radio 1's Unexpected Fluids show, and co-host of The Modern Mann podcast. Is it safe to have sex during the coronavirus outbreak? Dr Alex George: If you're in a relationship… living with that person, and sharing the same environment, it shouldn't change your situation. However if one of you is displaying symptoms of coronavirus then you should maintain your social-distancing and isolate, even within your home. In an ideal world everyone would stay two metres apart - even in their own house, but we realise this may not be realistic. Alix Fox: It's also really important not to assume that if you are experiencing mild symptoms of coronavirus it will be the same for your partner. So, if you're showing any symptoms whatsoever do try and stay away from your lover. What about sex with new people? Dr Alex: I certainly wouldn't advise having new sexual partners at the moment, because the risk is you could pass on the virus. Alix Fox: Don't forget as well, some people who are carriers of the virus won't have any symptoms. So even if you feel absolutely fine… you could still pass on the infection to someone and they could pass it on to other people via close contact and kissing. I kissed someone I recently met, and they've gone on to develop symptoms. What should I do? Dr Alex: If you've kissed or been in contact with someone who you think has gone on to develop coronavirus, make sure you self-isolate. Keep an eye on your symptoms. If you are developing symptoms, then be extra careful. Go online to the nhs.uk website. Only call the 111 service if your symptoms are so bad that you need medical support from us. Alix Fox: We should be responsible with each other, and for ourselves in our relationships. If you're somebody who has developed symptoms, and you know that you've kissed people recently, you should let them know. And even if you've kissed someone and they've got symptoms and you haven't, you should also self-isolate. I wasn't using condoms with my partner before coronavirus, should I start now? Alix Fox: The answer depends on why you weren't using condoms. If you weren't using condoms because you have both been tested for STIs, or you're in a heterosexual relationship prior to menopause and are using another kind of contraception to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, then that's fine. But if you weren't using condoms because you were relying on something like the pull-out method - or you were taking chances with STIs - then it's even more important that you use condoms now. Can I get coronavirus by touching someone else's vagina or penis? Dr Alex: If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva. Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus. We want to cut this back to the absolute minimum. So, no contact between a partner that you're not living with is really important. How can I maintain a relationship at a time like this? I don't want to be single now. Alix Fox: This whole pandemic is prompting a lot of people to rethink what a good sex life is and what constitutes as an enjoyable, pleasurable exchange. I've heard of people writing erotic stories to each other, and people who are dating but quarantined in different places taking advantage of the time and the distance. A lot of people have been getting really creative. If you use your imagination a little bit there are lots of ways you can have a sexy time without being face-to-face with somebody. It's also important to remember that right now… some people might be discovering that they or their partners have different libidos. You might find yourself in a situation where you were only going on a date once a week, and suddenly you're living under the same roof. You might find that you want sex when your partner doesn't, or vice versa. It's important to communicate this in a respectful, compassionate manner. Living together does not mean that you're entitled to sex whenever you want. And for anybody who is in a situation where they're with a partner and they're not having a good time, because they feel like they're being forced into sex, there are helplines available for that. Am I more at risk of catching coronavirus if I have HIV? Alix Fox: Dr Michael Brady at the Terrence Higgins Trust has provided some really great advice on this. If you are already on regular medication to manage HIV, and you have a good CD4 count (number of white blood cells to fight infection) and an undetectable viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) then you're not considered to have a weakened immune system. This means you run no additional risk of contracting coronavirus. So, if you're HIV positive, continue taking your meds as you would do. Make sure that you follow the same rules as everybody else when it comes to things like isolation. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

He is accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old male after plying him with alcohol at a bar in Nantucket in 2016. Assault claims against him have also surfaced in London and Los Angeles. What happened in court? Mr Spacey, 59, was mobbed by media as he arrived at the packed courtroom on the normally sleepy resort island of Nantucket on Monday after arriving by private jet. The actor nodded when Judge Thomas Barrett told him he was not allowed to contact the alleged victim. A lawyer for Spacey - whose legal name is Kevin S Fowler - had earlier asked the judge to allow the hearing to happen without the defendant present, but that request was refused. He was released without having to pay bail after a 10-minute hearing. The judge scheduled the next court date for 4 March. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison. What are the charges? Prosecutors announced on 24 December that Mr Spacey would be charged with indecent assault and battery stemming from an incident at the Club Car restaurant in Nantucket. The alleged victim is the son of former Boston local television news presenter Heather Unruh, who spoke publicly about the case last year. She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. The man, who is also suing Mr Spacey in civil court, will not be present during the criminal trial. According to prosecutors, the teenager told police that the actor had groped him as they stood together at a piano. He told police that he had video of the incident, and had sent a clip via the Snapchat app to his girlfriend. Mr Spacey's legal team say the video does not prove his guilt. During Monday's hearing, his lawyer Alan Jackson successfully argued the alleged victim must not delete material from his phone. No courtroom theatre Nick Bryant, BBC News, Nantucket This was a journey Kevin Spacey didn't want to make, and having touched down on this jet set island in a private plane, he waited on the tarmac until the final moment before making the short drive to his first appearance in court. His legal team argued he shouldn't have to appear in person, because of the negative publicity that's already surrounded this case. But the actor who's spent so much of his working life in front of the cameras, found it impossible today to avoid them. He entered by a side entrance, outfoxing some of the camera operators and photographers who had staked out positions over the weekend, but by no means all of them. A camera was also allowed into the courtroom to provide a live stream of the proceedings and to record the charge levelled against him - a charge he denies. During this short hearing, the actor briefly shared a joke with his lawyer but did not address the court. Dressed in a grey suit with polka-dot tie and patterned shirt, he spent most of the time peering benignly ahead at the judge, displaying no outward emotion. The small courtroom was packed with journalists and local onlookers - including some who had taken the ferry from the mainland to watch the proceedings. Many seemed rather disappointed that all they got to see was deliberations between the legal teams and the judge rather than hearing from the more central figure. But this now is a legal process, rather than courtroom theatre. What were the other allegations? The actor's career offers dried up after he was accused by actor Anthony Rapp in 2017 of making a sexual advance on him in 1986 when Mr Rapp was 14 years old. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event, but publicly apologised before issuing an \"absolute\" denial of all other allegations. In September last year, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Mr Spacey would not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around Mr Spacey's time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to the actor being axed from a number of roles, including Netflix series House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him. On Christmas Eve, Mr Spacey posted a video contesting the allegations against him. In the clip titled \"Let Me Be Frank\", Mr Spacey appeared as his character Frank Underwood from House of Cards, and said: \"I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn't do.\"", "summary": "好莱坞演员凯文·史派西（Kevin Spacy）出庭就猥亵侵犯和殴击指控接受聆讯，该指控源于2016年的一项性骚扰指控。"}

The UK is in 20th place, among higher achieving European countries, with the US in 28th. The OECD economic think tank says the comparisons - based on test scores in 76 countries - show the link between education and economic growth. \"This is the first time we have a truly global scale of the quality of education,\" said the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher. \"The idea is to give more countries, rich and poor, access to comparing themselves against the world's education leaders, to discover their relative strengths and weaknesses, and to see what the long-term economic gains from improved quality in schooling could be for them,\" he said. The top performer, Singapore, had high levels of illiteracy into the 1960s, said Mr Schleicher, showing how much progress could be made. In the UK, the study shows about one in five youngsters leave school without reaching a basic level of education - and the OECD says that reducing this number and improving skills could add trillions of dollars to the UK economy. \"I think it's partly a mindset, an expectation. There are plenty of examples of schools that have raised the bar dramatically,\" said education minister Lord Nash. But a leading UK head teacher, Sir Anthony Seldon, criticised such league tables as \"arguably doing more harm than good\". \"They are skewing schools and national education systems away from real learning towards repetitive rote learning,\" said Sir Anthony, head of Wellington College in Berkshire. The analysis, based on test scores in maths and science, is a much wider global map of education standards than the OECD's Pisa tests, which focus on more affluent industrialised countries. This latest league table, ranking more than a third of the world's nations, shows how countries such as Iran, South Africa, Peru and Thailand would appear on an international scale. It shows once again the poor performance of the United States, slipping behind successful European countries and being overtaken by Vietnam. It also highlights the decline of Sweden, with the OECD warning last week that it had serious problems in its education system. Figures mapped above show estimated growth in GDP over the lifetime of pupils. The figures assume that all pupils are enrolled in schools and that they achieve at least basic skills. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch The rankings are based on an amalgamation of international assessments, including the OECD's Pisa tests, the TIMSS tests run by US-based academics and TERCE tests in Latin America, putting developed and developing countries on a single scale. The findings will be formally presented at the World Education Forum in South Korea next week, where the United Nations is to convene a conference on targets for raising global education by 2030. 'Every student to succeed' The top five places are all taken by Asian countries - Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The five lowest-ranked countries are Oman in 72nd, Morocco, Honduras, South Africa and Ghana in last spot. \"If you go to an Asian classroom you'll find teachers who expect every student to succeed. There's a lot of rigour, a lot of focus and coherence,\" says Mr Schleicher. \"These countries are also very good at attracting the most talented teachers in the most challenging classrooms, so that every student has access to excellent teachers.\" The report, published by the OECD and written by Eric Hanushek from Stanford University and Ludger Woessmann from Munich University, argues that the standard of education is a \"powerful predictor of the wealth that countries will produce in the long run\". Take the test: How would your maths skills compare with the world's teenagers? \"Poor education policies and practices leave many countries in what amounts to a permanent state of economic recession,\" says the report. Millennium targets Improving education would produce \"long-term economic gains that are going to be phenomenal\", says Mr Schleicher. If Ghana, the lowest ranked country, achieved basic skills for all its 15-year-olds, the report says that it would expand its current GDP by 38 times, over the lifetime of today's youngsters. Only a minority of countries in Africa had sufficient test data to be included in these rankings - and it could be that countries such as Ghana are among the higher achievers in the continent, performing better than the majority for which there are no comparable figures. The report will provide evidence for next week's World Education Forum of how achieving education targets can deliver economic gains. The milestone conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, will mark 15 years since the setting of education targets by world leaders. These millennium targets for education, such as providing all children with a primary education, have not been fully achieved. But the World Education Forum will set another round of global targets for the next 15 years.", "summary": "由经济合作与发展组织（OECD）统计、全球最大规模的中小学排名公布，前五位均由亚洲国家和地区占据，非洲国家则排在末尾。"}

In a video, he denies being maltreated since his arrest in July 2015. The lawyer's wife and human rights activists have both said that Mr Xie was tortured in custody. His trial appears to have been held without advance public warning, the BBC's John Sudworth reports from Beijing, and there was no way foreign journalists could verify the court transcripts which, like the video, were released on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter. He is one a number of prominent lawyers put on trial recently who have mostly represented land grab victims and campaigners for democratic reform. Such cases are considered highly sensitive by the authorities. President Xi Jinping has overseen increasing restrictions on civil society while warning that Western ideals present a threat to national security. Mr Xie has been charged with \"inciting subversion of state power and disrupting court order\". \"My actions go against my role as a lawyer,\" he said in the video released by the Changsha Intermediate People's Court. \"I want to take this opportunity to express to other rights lawyers my view now that we should give up using contact with foreign media and independent media to hype sensitive news events, attack judicial institutions and smear the image of the nation's party organs while handling cases.\" In a precarious situation: Analysis by James Tsao, BBC Chinese Detained lawyers and human rights activists in China are often subject to similar show trials and abuses as those allegedly endured by Xie Yang. Human rights activists say that few if any receive a fair trial. Mr Xie has worked on a number of cases considered politically sensitive by China's ruling Communist Party and was among hundreds of lawyers and activists detained in what became known as the \"709 crackdown\" - named after the date of the first disappearance of a group of lawyers on 9 July 2015. It was part of the toughest government action against Chinese civil society for years. Although the majority of those held were released on bail, last year six of them were found guilty of serious crimes, with some sentenced for up to seven years in prison. Mr Xie is now in a precarious position - he has not endeared himself to the government by defending mainland supporters of Hong Kong democracy activists. Patrick Poon, of human rights group Amnesty International, said the Chinese authorities had wanted to use his trial \"to discredit his lawyers and the western media\". On Friday, the UN human rights office demanded that the Chinese government release all lawyers and activists that it said were being held simply for defending the basic rights of Chinese citizens. Last week Mr Xie's lawyer, Chen Jiangang, was himself detained by police. Mr Xie's US-based wife said in January that he had been tortured while in custody. US-based charity Chinese Human Rights Defenders says that Mr Xie informed his lawyers earlier this year that police had subjected him to extensive sleep deprivation, prolonged interrogations, beatings and death threats to get him to confess his guilt and incriminate colleagues.", "summary": "中国一名人权律师周一在法庭对其\"煽动颠覆国家政权\"的指控认罪。律师谢阳的案件受到了国际媒体关注。批评者形容这是一场\"作秀式的庭审\"。"}

Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral. Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was \"in good health\". The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now \"following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare\". A Clarence House statement read: \"In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. \"The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. \"It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.\" The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive. Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits. The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service. It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk. Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus. Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately. It's not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it. They've got a small staff with them - and it's expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms. The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort. However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had been informed about the prince's positive test result on Tuesday morning and he wished him \"a speedy recovery\". The spokesman added the PM's weekly audience with the Queen was now taking place by telephone. Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the coronavirus death toll in England to 414.

She later met regional mayors and governors, who agreed to her plans. But some activists promised to carry on with the largest protests Brazil has seen for at least two decades. Ms Rousseff said the reforms would be broad and focus on five areas: Mayara Longo Vivian, a leader of the Free Fare Movement, said there had been \"concrete measures\" among the president's proposals and that the \"fight would continue\". On Monday evening, there were fresh demonstrations in several cities, although they appeared to be smaller than those that led to clashes with police last week. The BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro says exactly a week ago 100,000 people marched down the city's Rio Branco Avenue, but on Monday just a few dozen were chanting in front of the Candelaria church. More people joined in as they marched, and soon a few thousand demonstrators had popped up and were occupying the city centre's main avenue. Street vendors were selling Brazilian flags and Anonymous masks for those who came unprepared, she says. In other protests, hundreds of people blocked the main road to Brazil's busiest port, Santos, and hundreds more came out to protest against corruption in the capital, Brasilia. Two women were killed at a protest in the central state of Goias, not far from Brasilia. Police said they were killed by a driver who sped through a roadblock they had set up with other protesters. The deaths bring to four the total number of lives lost in the unrest. 'Signals' The president met leaders of one protest faction before meeting with state governors and mayors. \"My government is listening to democratic voices,\" she told a televised news conference. \"We must learn to hear the voices of the street. We all must, without exception, understand these signals with humility and accuracy. \"Brazil is ready to move forward and has made it clear it does not want to stand where it is.\" She also suggested tougher penalties for corruption, and warned against any repeat of the violence that was seen last Thursday. 'No plan B' Ms Rousseff faces re-election next year, when Brazil is also due to host the football World Cup. Rio de Janeiro will also host the Olympics in 2016. Many of those demonstrating are unhappy at the cost of building stadiums in a country where many live in poverty and ticket prices for such prestigious international competitions are out of reach. Unrest has dogged many of the fixtures currently taking place in Brazil as part of Fifa's Confederations Cup, seen as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup and using many of the same facilities. Fifa's Secretary General Jerome Valcke has said the organisation has \"no plan B\" for next year's World Cup. The wave of rallies in more than 100 cities began in Sao Paulo, where residents were unhappy at planned rises in public-transport fares. Those increases have since been shelved, but the protests rapidly became more widespread and the protesters' demands more wide-ranging. Brazilians have been demanding better health and education, saying they are fed up with paying relatively high taxes and feel that they do not get enough back from the state.

Last week a US congressional report warned against allowing Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE Corp to supply critical telecom infrastructure. The firms have always denied espionage. The classified inquiry was a thorough review of how Huawei worked, involving nearly 1,000 telecom equipment buyers. One of the government employees involved with the inquiry told Reuters: \"We knew certain parts of government really wanted evidence of active spying. We would have found it if it were there.\" Huawei spokesman Bill Plummer said: \"Huawei is not familiar with the review, but we are not surprised to hear that the White House has concluded there is no evidence of any Huawei involvement with any espionage or other non-commercial activities. \"Huawei is a $32bn [£19bn] independent multinational that would not jeopardise its success or the integrity of its customers' networks for any government or third party - ever,\" he added.

He blamed sloppy coding rather than any deliberate attempt to leave backdoors open for spying purposes. Questions about the relationship between Huawei, ZTC and the Chinese government circulated last week following a report from the US House Intelligence Committee. While the report did not present concrete evidence that either Huawei or ZTE had stolen US data, it said had classified information that provided \"significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns\" about the risk to the United States. It also criticised Huawei for failing to provide details about its relationship with the Chinese government. Attitudes about Huawei differ from nation to nation. Canada said last week that the firm could not bid to help build a secure national network.

Not those of the United States, Japan, India or much of the European Union. They've declined the invitation. But this weekend Mr Xi is gathering all the presidents and prime ministers he can muster in Beijing, hoping to inspire them with a vision about China as a force for good in the world. Xi Jinping came to power five years ago with a determination that China should stop hiding its light under a bushel. Instead of creeping up timidly on the world order, he felt it should walk tall as a mighty and ancient civilisation which had gone from marginal economic player to the world's biggest trading nation in less than four decades. \"The relationship between China and the rest of the world is undergoing historic changes. Tell China stories well,\" he urged the nation's media, diplomats and think tanks, adding that they must present China as a builder of world peace and contributor to global development. This weekend he himself takes the stage as storyteller in chief at Beijing's Belt and Road Forum. It helps that there is currently no competing global narrative from the United States or the European Union, as President Trump turns inward to \"Make America Great Again\" and the EU struggles with Brexit and a slew of other challenges. A geopolitical agenda? China's underlying narrative is well known to all Mr Xi's guests. Economic transformation and breakneck growth have returned it to its traditional position at the centre of the East Asian economy. And now Mr Xi wants to use Chinese money and construction might to rebuild much of Eurasia's infrastructure of ports, roads and rails and put China at its heart. A giant exercise in joining the dots whose buzzword is connectivity. Critics in Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi observe that some of the biggest belt and road projects seem to be for strategically significant assets. Like the oil and gas pipelines across Central Asia, and the Indian Ocean ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka which might serve military as well as commercial uses. Many observers see an obvious geopolitical agenda to the belt and road initiative, but in a suspicious and prickly neighbourhood China firmly denies it. To make the plan less threatening, it frames it as a revival of the ancient Silk Road whose camel caravans carried Chinese goods west across Asia more than 1,000 years ago. The aim is a soft-power message of a China which is mighty but peaceful, delivering what it can to the world in exchanges of mutual benefit. But the belt and road is much more ambitious than a camel caravan. By land and by sea, through transport networks, telecoms, energy pipelines and industrial hubs, it promises to integrate more than 60 countries and 60% of the world's population. And for domestic Chinese audiences, the story of the belt and road is told with a different emphasis, focusing less on the wins for foreigners and more on opportunities for China's impoverished west and assisting China's push up the value chain into industries like high speed rail and nuclear power. Bedtime stories There's even a narrative aimed at foreign children. Mr Xi may be the headline act on stage this weekend but in the scramble to offer the warm up, the state-owned China Daily newspaper is running online videos of an American father telling his daughter bedtime stories about the belt and road as \"China's idea which belongs to the world\". And in a catchy music video, ukulele strumming multi-ethnic children surrounded by cut-out camels sing the praises of the belt and road. \"We're paving new roads, building more ports, finding new options with friends of all sorts, It's a culture exchange, we trade in our wealth, we connect with our hearts, it strengthens our health,\" it goes. Mr Xi has been telling the belt and road story for four years now. Why gather the world's decision makers in Beijing for a grand rendition now? Personal and national ambitions One short answer is that he needs to drum up growth. China's domestic economy is slowing and exporting Chinese construction capacity to the belt and road would help boost the domestic economy in the short and medium term. If even some of the infrastructure projects succeed, they might in turn contribute to growth in the long term by spurring demand from China's neighbours. But a more personal reason for the timing is Mr Xi's own political cycle. In the one-party state, being Communist Party leader is more important than being president and this year China will hold a vital Party Congress. Hosting the world this weekend burnishes Xi Jinping's aura of invincibility by reminding his party and public that he is increasing China's clout on the international stage. A third reason for the timing is the international picture. Many of America's friends and allies in the region were dismayed by Mr Trump's decision to walk away from the TPP trade agreement, an agreement which his predecessor had said was vital to the US setting the rules of the road in Asia rather than letting China set them. Mr Xi's new push for the belt and road initiative is the same kind of canny political opportunism that spurred his defence of globalisation at the Davos forum in January. Indeterminate outcome So China's president has been lucky in his timing and bold in seizing the stage. And it will certainly look to his guests as if he usually gets what he wants. No country puts on a grand spectacle of purpose and progress quite like China does. This weekend Beijing's sky will be blue. Smog, traffic snarl and ghost towns littered with white elephant infrastructure will be safely far from view. This is the show and tell of Xi Jinping's story… China the can-do master builder inspiring awe in all beholders and giving hope that what China has achieved at home it might replicate elsewhere. But the truth is that Mr Xi's will works as an organising principle only for some of the people some of the time, and usually only for a very small number of highly specific objectives. Even in Beijing, the sky is not always blue, the traffic is often snarled and resources are often misallocated. How much more is this true beyond the glittering capital. China is an economy with a perilous debt overhang precisely because its investors are just as fallible as those of other countries. Yes, on the right project and for the right price, Chinese money and Chinese master builders can work infrastructure wonders. But that was always the case. The belt and road is an important initiative, but one of indeterminate boundaries, duration and outcome. Mr Xi's guests should not make the mistake of thinking all Chinese players will do his bidding and all bedtime stories will come true.", "summary": "中国国家主席习近平要给全世界讲故事了。"}

It warned of children and young people being forced into sexual exploitation and slavery by criminal gangs. Save the Children says some 26,000 child migrants arrived in Europe last year without any family. It is the first time Europol has given a Europe-wide estimate of how many might be missing. What happens to lone child migrants? Migration to Europe explained in graphics Targeting refugees \"It's not unreasonable to say that we're looking at 10,000-plus children,\" Europol's chief of staff told the Observer newspaper. \"Not all of them will be criminally exploited; some might have been passed on to family members. We just don't know where they are, what they're doing or whom they are with.\" Officials in Italy warned in May 2015 that almost 5,000 children had disappeared from asylum reception centres since the previous summer. In October, the authorities in Trelleborg in southern Sweden said about 1,000 unaccompanied refugee children and young adults who arrived in the town in the previous month had since gone missing. Confirming the overall estimate of missing minors, a Europol spokesman said a large proportion may have also disappeared after landing in Greece. The country is the first entry point for most of the 1 million migrants who arrived in Europe by boat in 2015, and authorities have been criticised for failing to register and check the arrivals. Criminal gangs known to be involved in human trafficking in Europe are now targeting refugees, Europol said. There are fears unaccompanied children and young people may be dragged into sex work, slavery and other illegal activity. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle told the BBC the figure of 10,000 missing children was \"shocking but not surprising\". He said it was \"to be expected\" that many of these would be caught up in exploitation. \"Let's hope now the EU puts the resources into finding these children, helping them and reuniting these children with their families.\" Exploited and abandoned The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler exposed the plight of vulnerable children arriving in Italy in an investigation last year. Here is an extract: Fabio Sorgoni works for the Italian charity On The Road. He told me that there is a very short window of time to provide unaccompanied minors arriving in Europe with a safe haven. By law, they are allowed out of reception centres during the day, when they easily fall prey to organised crime or individuals looking to exploit them, he said. Few Italian centres have enough translators who speak the children's languages. They do not employ staff experienced in spotting victims of sexual exploitation. Feeling uncertain and unprotected, thousands of children have run away from Italian reception centres, disappearing on to the streets. With no one stepping in or taking responsibility for them, they're left to fend for themselves - doing what it takes to survive. The warning from Europol comes days after the UK government said it would accept more unaccompanied child refugees from Syria and other conflict zones, without giving numbers. However, it said it would not be taking in vulnerable children who had already made it into Europe. On Saturday, at least 39 migrants, including several children, drowned trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The IOM said on Friday that 244 migrants had drowned in the Mediterranean so far this year, out of 55,568 arrivals. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "summary": "欧洲刑警组织说，过去两年的移民潮中，可能有超过1万名儿童在抵达欧洲后下落不明。"}

It claimed the stolen information came from more than 420,000 websites, including \"many leaders in virtually all industries across the world\". Hold Security did not give details of the companies affected by the hack. \"They didn't just target large companies; instead, they targeted every site that their victims visited,\" Hold Security said in its report. \"With hundreds of thousands of sites affected, the list includes many leaders in virtually all industries across the world, as well as a multitude of small or even personal websites.\" The New York Times, which first reported the findings, said that on its request \"a security expert not affiliated with Hold Security analysed the database of stolen credentials and confirmed it was authentic\". \"Another computer crime expert who had reviewed the data, but was not allowed to discuss it publicly, said some big companies were aware that their records were among the stolen information,\" the paper said. The paper added: \"Hold Security would not name the victims, citing nondisclosure agreements and a reluctance to name companies whose sites remained vulnerable.\" The Wall Street Journal later revealed that Hold Security intended to offer website owners the ability to check whether they had been affected, but only if they paid a fee. The firm has since posted a message on its site saying it will charge $120 (£71) a month for a \"breach notification service\". One computer security expert said he was surprised by this approach. \"This situation is quite unusual in that the company has decided to charge for this information,\" Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London's computer science department told the BBC. \"Usually they would do an initial disclosure [of who had been affected] for free and then offer their services for a fee at a later stage. \"The company rightly points out that there is going to be a huge amount of work to securely contact all the affected websites, but a common solution to this is to partner with a government or industry-funded organisation to help with that.\" Despite the large amount of credentials said to have been compromised, Dr Murdoch added that it would be premature to advise the public to reset all their passwords. \"Although there's a large amount of passwords involved, a lot of them could be irrelevant and many of the websites tiny,\" he said. \"It's not necessarily the case that a large proportion of internet users have been affected. Until we get more statistics we won't know that. \"So, there's no reason to panic now, but perhaps it's a good reminder to follow best practice of not using the same password on multiple websites, because this will not be the last time such a breach happens.\" Multi-pronged attack? Hold Security, which has previously reported about hacks on Adobe and Target, said it took more than seven months of research to discover the extent of the latest hack. The firm claimed the gang initially acquired databases of stolen credentials from fellow hackers on the black market. \"These databases were used to attack e-mail providers, social media, and other websites to distribute spam to victims and install malicious redirections on legitimate systems,\" Hold Security said. The hackers also got access to data from botnets - a network of computers infected with malware to trigger online fraud. Hold Security said the botnets helped the hacking group - which it dubbed CyberVor - identify more than 400,000 websites that were vulnerable to cyber attacks. \"The CyberVors used these vulnerabilities to steal data from these sites' databases,\" the firm said. \"To the best of our knowledge, they mostly focused on stealing credentials, eventually ending up with the largest cache of stolen personal information, totalling over 1.2 billion unique sets of e-mails and passwords.\" The firm is now marketing its breach notification service as a way to \"stay ahead of the hackers \". But one of its rivals expressed surprise at this approach. \"For a long time the security industry has freely shared information on breaches within its own community,\" said Vanja Svajcer, principal security researcher at Sophos. \"Researchers discovering credentials breaches usually help end users either by making the information about compromised accounts public or by working with the company whose servers were compromised to inform all affected users. \"In this case, the credentials were harvested from thousands of servers and it would be difficult to work with every server owner to inform the compromised users. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect the company to make the information freely available so everybody can check that none of their email addresses have been compromised.\" Password tips The University of Surrey's Prof Alan Woodward suggests the following rules should be observed when picking a new password. Don't choose one obviously associated with you Hackers can find out a lot about you from social media so if they are targeting you specifically and you choose, say, your pet's name you're in trouble. Choose words that don't appear in a dictionary Hackers can precalculate the encrypted forms of whole dictionaries and easily reverse engineer your password. Use a mixture of unusual characters You can use a word or phrase that you can easily remember but where characters are substituted, eg, Myd0gha2B1g3ars! Have different passwords for different sites and systems If hackers compromise one system you do not want them having the key to unlock all your other accounts. Keep them safely With multiple passwords it is tempting to write them down and carry them around with you. Better to use some form of secure password vault on your phone.", "summary": "网络安全公司的研究人员说，俄罗斯黑客已从美国和全球的大小公司那里窃取了12亿用户的用户名和密码组合。"}

The announcement clears the way for airlines to permit the use of mobile phones, once they have conducted their own safety reviews. Currently airline passengers have to switch devices to flight mode and make calls from the airport terminal. The EASA sets the framework for airlines making safety decisions. The agency said each airline would still have to go through an assessment process, ensuring aircraft systems are not affected by the signals from portable electronic devices before establishing their own rules for their operation. As a result there could be a delay in implementing the new rules at some airlines. It also says that airlines may opt for different policies on the use of mobile devices. Analysis: Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent This move strips away the last regulatory hurdle stopping airline passengers in Europe from making phone calls or using wi-fi on any flight, even while taxiing. But that doesn't mean you'll have to endure the bloke next to you babbling on about his work for an hour during your next flight. First of all, you can't get a signal at 33,000 feet. Not yet anyway. Secondly, the airlines will need to pay to kit out their planes so that phones and wi-fi work. And thirdly, there's the passengers. British Airways, for example, already has a business-class-only flight from London to New York that lets passengers use wi-fi and send texts. But they block voice-calls, because whenever they survey passengers, most baulk at the idea of everyone around them talking on the phone during a flight.

Israel recently carried out scores of air strikes in Syria. The F-35, from the world's priciest military programme, has been criticised both for cost and combat effectiveness. Last year, Defence Secretary James Mattis had to defend the programme after then President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticising its huge price, said to be close to $100m (£74m) per plane. 'Game-changer' Maj Gen Amikam Norkin told heads of 20 foreign air forces meeting in Israel: \"We are flying the F-35 all over the Middle East and have already attacked twice on two different fronts.\" He did not specify the targets. \"You know that we just won the Eurovision with the song 'Toy.' Well, the F-35 is not a toy,\" he said. Israel, the first country outside the US to acquire the single-seat fighter, has received nine of the 50 F-35s it has so far ordered, and could take up to 75. In Israel it is referred to by its Hebrew name \"Adir\" (Mighty). The jets are believed to be the F-35A variant - conventional takeoff and landing. The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says Israel's claim to have used it in an operational strike even before the Americans may be designed as a further show of military strength, as it believes elite Iranian forces are trying to entrench themselves in Syria to threaten Israel. Israel said its recent air strikes inside Syria targeted Iranian military infrastructure, in response to rocket fire aimed at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran has hundreds of personnel in Syria, who it says serve as military advisers to the Syrian army. It has also sent thousands of volunteer fighters in support of the Syrian government. The US has given Israel more military aid than any other country in the world - currently around $4bn a year - and its laws on arms sales require that Israel always maintains military superiority in the Middle East. F-35: Why its maker says it's so advanced Israel has praised the Lockheed Martin F-35 as a \"game-changer\". This may not even be its first use by Israel. Its military is often quiet about its operations and there were reports that the stealth fighter had been used operationally as early as January last year. The US has certainly put a lot of faith in a programme that is expected to run through to 2070 and is projected to cost $1.5tn by then. However, it has also come in for heavy criticism and not just over the price. An influential military blog in 2015 reported that the F-35 lacked manoeuvrability and was unable to beat an F-16 in a dogfight. It was also reported to have cockpit visibility issues. Analysts say the emphasis on stealth capabilities may have compromised air-to-air effectiveness.", "summary": "美国制F-35隐形战机，首度用于实战，以色列空军近日在叙利亚境内将其投入使用。"}

This could see state pupils taking the private school common entrance exam and state schools staying open longer. Mr Gove has been embroiled in a row over the replacement of the Ofsted chair and has been warned against surrounding himself with \"yes men\". The education secretary, speaking at the London Academy of Excellence, said that for decades \"the dominant consensus has been that state education in England was barely satisfactory\". Global tests But now he said the state system was improving, with better results, more pupils taking tougher subjects and fewer weak schools. Mr Gove said that commentators had associated state schools with \"poor discipline, low standards, entrenched illiteracy, widespread innumeracy\", but he said that this \"pessimistic view is no longer tenable\". Mr Gove said that he wanted to push state schools further so that they would become indistinguishable from private schools. He said he wanted schools to be able to stay open longer for nine or 10 hour days. This would allow more time for after-school activities or to provide a place for children to do their homework. Academies, which are now the majority of secondary schools, can already set their own hours. He called for more testing, including taking the common entrance exam taken by 13 year olds in some private schools. Mr Gove backed plans for individual secondary schools to be able to take the OECD's international Pisa tests. \"Our heads and teachers can, if they choose, check how well their pupils are performing compared to their peers - not just down the road - but on the other side of the globe, in Shanghai or Singapore,\" says Mr Gove. Inspection rows The \"superb leadership\" of Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted's chief inspector, was also praised by the education secretary. Sir Michael last week issued an angry warning, saying that he was \"spitting blood\" that he was being undermined by briefings which he linked to the Department for Education. Mr Gove denied claims his team had briefed against the inspectorate, which in turn had been welcomed by Sir Michael who said he would defend his team against \"unfair criticism\". A previous Ofsted chief inspector, Sir David Bell, also issued a warning to Mr Gove not \"to believe his own hype\". Writing for website The Conversation, Sir David Bell said Mr Gove should not surround himself with \"yes men\". It followed a dispute over the replacement of the chair of Ofsted, Baroness Morgan. Mr Gove said he wanted to \"refresh\" the leadership of the schools' watchdog and denied his intention to remove the Labour peer was politically motivated. Speaking on Monday, he said the decision had been entirely his own and that a replacement would be appointed on merit, regardless of political affiliation. But the row over the change at the top of England's schools watchdog intensified further with the intervention of Sir David, who as well as having served as Ofsted's chief inspector later worked alongside Mr Gove as his most senior civil servant at the Department for Education. 'Cut off' Sir David warned the education secretary of the risk of becoming isolated by listening only to supporters. \"The day-to-day grind of policy battles, firefighting and political ding-dong can start to cut you off from outside ideas and thinking. \"The row over Ofsted's leadership shows the importance of retaining and being seen to retain independent voices near the top - not simply 'yes men',\" said Sir David, who is now the vice chancellor of the University of Reading. Sir David said Mr Gove should not dismiss all critics of his education policy but should engage with those offering an \"intelligent critique\". On Sunday, Mr Gove said he had appointed Baroness Morgan, and despite the fact he felt she had done a \"fantastic job\" the position needed a \"fresh perspective\". Baroness Morgan, who has not had her term in office renewed, told the BBC she was the victim of a \"determined effort from Number 10\" to appoint more Tories. Unions criticised The decision was criticised by the Liberal Democrats and Labour. The director of the Institute for Government, Peter Riddell, said the decision not to reappoint Baroness Morgan had \"raised some eyebrows\" but there was nothing new about ministerial involvement. Another former Ofsted chairwoman, Zenna Atkins, has backed Mr Gove over Baroness Morgan's departure, saying she has \"seen nothing that suggest it's a political move\". Sir David also had tough words about teachers' unions, saying their \"political naivety has been astonishing\". \"Their barrage of industrial action and knee-jerk opposition to any change has allowed the education secretary and his supporters to characterise them as cartoon-like bogeymen,\" he writes. Sir David was part of a group of business leaders and academics who published a report last week calling for a more independent, non-political approach to education policy. Responding to Mr Gove's speech on Monday, Labour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said: \"Improving school standards starts with a qualified teacher in every classroom. Until Michael Gove commits to this, he is ruling himself out of any serious debate about how we raise standards in our schools. \"Whether on discipline, delivering extra-curricular activities or on improving learning outcomes: it all hinges on the quality of the teacher in the classroom. Raising the quality of teaching - that is where the focus needs to be and that is what Labour is concerned with. The Tories have lost sight of this and are undermining school standards as a result.\" Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, challenged the idea of state schools using the common entrance exam. \"Why would we imagine that that is an appropriate examination? He's not discussed that with anybody, he's not discussed it with any of the exam boards, he's certainly not discussed it with the representatives of teachers,\" said Ms Blower.", "summary": "英国教育大臣戈夫（Michael Gove）表示，英格兰的公校在管理上要学习私校的做法。"}

Ms O'Grady's speech to TUC delegates in Liverpool expanded on the annual conference's main theme of living standards. 'Silver spoons' She said: \"Are we going to settle for a nastier and poorer Britain - a Downton Abbey-style society, in which the living standards of the vast majority are sacrificed to protect the high living of the well-to-do? \"We are piling yet more riches onto a privileged few. Economic growth is back but there's no sign of it in most workers' pay packets. In fact, the gap has got worse.

What is social mobility? Social mobility means the degree to which a person's social status, or class, can change throughout their life. Social mobility occurs whenever someone moves across social class boundaries. This is difficult to measure. Class might be measured by education, income or background. Of most interest is the question of whether people from poor or deprived backgrounds are equally able as those from privileged backgrounds to achieve success - usually measured by income - in life. Historically, social background has played a large part in determining a person's life opportunities and future success. Mr Miliband will thank \"trade unions, trade unionists and the labour movement\" who, he will say, are \"playing such an important role in keeping Scotland and the United Kingdom together\" by supporting the campaign against Scottish independence ahead of the referendum on 18 September. Usdaw, the NUM, the GMB, Aslef, Community and the CWU have signed a joint statement to this effect. \"These trade unions are saying that the choice which is true to Labour's traditions, to trade union traditions, is to say 'No',\" he will say. However, the RMT union is supporting the Yes campaign in Scotland and the TUC has declared itself neutral in the debate. Ms O'Grady reiterated this position during a media briefing on Sunday. In her speech she paid tribute to Bob Crow, the outspoken RMT leader who died earlier this year, saying: \"Bob may be gone, but his spirit lives on.\"", "summary": "英国工会领导人警告，英国的社会流动“出现倒流”，正在形成“唐顿庄元”式社会。"}

His government would \"swiftly implement Operation Sovereign Borders\" aimed at \"intercepting vessels and turning them around\", Mr Abbott told the Herald Sun. Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd has said he will not stand again for Labor leadership. The Australian Election Commission confirmed on its website that the Liberal-National coalition had won 88 seats in the House of Representatives, and Labor 57. Mr Rudd had called the election after defeating Julia Gillard in a leadership challenge in June, amid dismal polling figures. Under Mr Rudd, Labor initially saw its figures improve. But Mr Abbott, who enjoyed the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, then widened the gap again. The main election issues were how to tackle an expected economic slowdown, whether to keep the Labor-introduced carbon tax, and how to reduce the number of migrants arriving from Asia by boat. 'Nature of the job' Mr Abbott told the Herald Sun his government was poised to \"deliver on our commitments, starting from day one\". He said he would be receiving his first briefings from public servants on Sunday, in order to begin implementing policy changes. \"Scrapping the carbon tax and stopping the boats are the two most urgent priorities,\" Mr Abbott said. \"Obviously, we will swiftly implement Operation Sovereign Borders and one component is a much more active programme of intercepting vessels and where possible turning them around - rather than escorting them to Christmas Island.\" But the new leader also insisted he intended to be a \"consultative, collegiate prime minister\". \"You have to govern for everyone including the people that didn't vote for you and the people who probably won't ever support you - that's the nature of the job,\" he said. He has also vowed to reduce the foreign aid budget by A$4.5bn ($4bn; £2.6bn). But New Zealand Prime Minister John Key warned the cuts would strain small Pacific island nations, a major beneficiary of Australian aid. \"These are countries that need a lot of support and help, so if there is less money coming their way, they'll obviously feel that over time,\" he said. Party crashed Mr Abbott's election victory party on Saturday night was briefly disrupted when a protester gained access to the venue wearing a fake security wristband.

The bride dressed by a British designer, her flowers containing sprigs of myrtle cut from the same bush used for Queen Victoria's bouquet. And cheering crowds. This is the template for a royal wedding, as celebrated by William's great-grandparents, his grandparents, his father and mother, aunts and uncles. More recent nuptials - Edward and Sophie's, Charles and Camilla's - have been modest affairs by royal standards, with buffet-style wedding breakfasts and intimate ceremonies in Windsor. Were these a break from, or a return to royal tradition? Modern royal weddings - those in the past 90-odd years - mark a significant break with the past, says Fiona Macdonald, author of Royal Weddings: A Very Peculiar History. \"Until the 19th Century and early in the 1900s, the pattern had been largely the same for the past 1,000 years. Royal weddings were usually arranged for political, dynastic and empire-building reasons, and the bride and groom were always of mutually royal rank. \"Marrying a commoner was exceptionally rare. The most famous example was Edward IV marrying Elizabeth Woodville in the 15th Century.\" That was just what Prince Albert did, marrying Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, daughter of a minor Scottish aristocrat, in 1923 at Westminster Abbey. As the second son, Albert had somewhat more freedom of choice than his brother Edward. But Edward abdicated to be with Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, and so Prince Albert became King George VI, his wife became Queen Elizabeth, and their daughter Elizabeth became heir to the throne. When she was 11, five possible future bridegrooms from four foreign families were under consideration, including the man she eventually fell in love with - Prince Philip of Greece. He renounced his own titles in order to be her consort, and the future queen married the Duke of Edinburgh at Westminster Abbey in 1947. A very British church William and Kate will also become man and wife at Westminster Abbey. Yet it only became the venue of choice for royal weddings late in its 1,000-year history. Prior to World War I, kings and queens, princes and princesses married in private in royal chapels or palaces. The war meant the royal family was keen to play down its German heritage, and to strengthen its rapport with the British people. King George V changed the family's Germanic name to Windsor. \"He also encouraged the use of Westminster Abbey for royal weddings. It was the great British church, founded by a king and where kings and queens were traditionally crowned,\" says Macdonald, adding that its size meant a wider circle of guests could be invited. \"Throughout the 20th Century, grand processions through the streets were a feature of almost all royal weddings. There were also street decorations, and sometimes street parties. These were a very powerful way of allowing ordinary people to share in the royal ceremony.\" The venue, the national mood of celebration - no wonder the marriage of Elizabeth and Philip was the definitive modern royal wedding: In another first, newsreel cameras were allowed into the Abbey itself, although those watching the wedding film only saw the backs of the happy couple at the altar. Royal weddings first became public spectacles in the later half of the 19th Century, with the advent of mass media such as daily newspapers. \"Once reliable telegraphy was up and running, British royal events became news across the Atlantic and throughout the Empire,\" says Ms Macdonald. In 1923, the Archbishop of Canterbury vetoed live radio coverage of Prince Albert's wedding, who feared men would listen in pubs, while still wearing their hats. Instead, a silent newsreel was shown in cinemas worldwide. The first royal wedding to be televised live came when Princess Margaret married Lord Snowdon in 1960. But TV audiences did not witness an exchange of vows until 21 years later, when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer. \"By the time of Edward and Sophie's, and Charles and Camilla's weddings, there was a mingling of old and new royal wedding traditions - televised, but more intimate and less stately occasions,\" says Ms Macdonald. When William marries Kate in April, intimate is unlikely to be the adjective of choice. For it will be the wedding of a future king and queen.", "summary": "剑桥公爵（the Duke of Cambridge）威廉王子一年前迎娶平民女子凯特·米德尔顿（Kate Middleton）时，盛大的婚礼举世瞩目，新郎新娘脸上洋溢着幸福。"}

The United States said it was offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation. On Saturday evening, after talks in Vienna, international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of the nuclear deal agreed last year. The lifting of the sanctions was announced by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Three of the US citizens - Rezaian, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati - were released from prison on Saturday and were flown to Switzerland then to Germany on Sunday. They were expected to receive medical treatment at a US base there. A fourth, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly with them, US officials said. US citizens released by Iran The four prisoners are all dual US-Iran citizens. Jason Rezaian: aged 39, Tehran correspondent for the Washington Post. Detained in Iran for more than a year before his sentencing last November. Saeed Abedini: aged 35, a Christian pastor who had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organising churches in people's houses. Amir Hekmati: aged 32, former Marine who spent more than four years in prison on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother. Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari: Little is known about the fourth US citizen. Iranian citizens released by the US Of the seven Iranian citizens being released, six are also citizens of the US. The Iranian state news agency listed them as: Nader Modanlo, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun. They are all accused or convicted of violating US sanctions on Iran. A US official said a diplomatic channel was established \"with the focus of getting our detained US citizens home\". \"Iran has also committed to continue co-operating with the United States to determine the whereabouts of Robert Levinson,\" the official said. According to the Associated Press news agency, Mr Levinson is a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence mission. A further 14 Iranians sought by the US would be removed from an Interpol wanted list, the US and Iran said. A fifth American, writer and student Matthew Trevithick, was also released from jail in Iran on Saturday, but his release was not part of the prisoner exchange. His family said in a statement published on the Iran Primer website that he had been held at Evin prison in Tehran for 40 days. He had been studying languages in Iran, they said. Analysis: Sebastian Usher, Middle East Editor, BBC World Service For months after his arrest in 2014, there was uncertainty over what accusations Jason Rezaian was facing. He was held in the notorious Evin prison before finally being found guilty on charges that his lawyer said included espionage. His newspaper vigorously denied this. President Barack Obama said he would not rest until he was freed. Now, his release has been announced in what Iran calls a prisoner swap - an indication he might have been used as a bargaining chip. His release removes a shadow that had lain over relations between Tehran and Washington even as they were thawing with the nuclear deal. Jason Rezaian - Now a free man The media freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders welcomed Rezaian's release, saying he \"was just doing his job as a reporter and was unlucky enough to have dual US and Iranian nationality at a time when the two countries were conducting tense negotiations about Iran's nuclear programme\". \"We are thrilled to see Jason finally free, but he should have never been imprisoned in the first place. Jason was innocent. It is outrageous that he has been used as a bargaining chip,\" said Christophe Deloire, the organisation's secretary general.", "summary": "预计国际制裁即将解除之际，伊朗释放了《华盛顿邮报》记者杰森∙雷萨安和另外3名其关押的美国人。"}

Rowling said that she would like the new Harry Potter play to be seen widely around the world. Asked if the show would head to Broadway, she told the BBC: \"I'd love it to go wider than that. I'd like as many Potter fans to see it as possible.\" The story, by Rowling, writer Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series, the Deathly Hallows. It portrays the stars of Rowling's wizarding saga as adults with their own children heading off to school. Audiences had been urged to \"keep the secrets\" since the play - presented in two parts over five hours - began previews in early June. It won a number of five-star reviews earlier this week, with one critic describing it as \"a game-changing production\". Rowling, Thorne and Tiffany joined the cast on stage as the audience gave a standing ovation at the close of part two of the play on Saturday night. Speaking earlier, Tiffany said the play had \"not massively changed\" during the preview period. \"We've crystallised and evolved some of the illusions and costumes - all of the actors are still in it, I'm glad to say. It's been great to see it develop in front of an audience.\" The script book of the play, billed as the eighth Harry Potter story, was published at midnight, with bookshops around the world holding late-night openings to allow fans to pick up their copies. Waterstones said 140 of its shops were hosting Potter parties on Saturday night, with the largest events in Edinburgh, Manchester Deansgate and London's Piccadilly. About 700 people dressed as witches, wizards and magical creatures flocked to the Piccadilly store for its launch. A spokeswoman said: \"Our pre-orders have exceeded six figures - numbers we haven't seen since the last Harry Potter book and we fully expect Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to be our best-selling book of the year.\" It is a similar story in the US where booksellers Barnes and Noble said the script had broken the pre-order record set by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films. Potter fans are also preparing themselves for spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, written by Rowling, which opens in November.

The armed forces are already providing some 13,500 personnel - this could now reach 17,000, meaning summer leave for some troops is likely to be cancelled. G4S said it had \"some issues in relation to workforce supply\". The company is being paid £300m to guard the Games, but the BBC understands it has not been able to guarantee it can supply the 10,000 guards it has been contracted to deliver. 'No impact' A G4S spokeswoman said the company had accepted \"that the government has decided to overlay additional resources\". She added: \"This has been an unprecedented and very complex security recruitment, training and deployment exercise which has been carried out to a tight timescale. \"We have encountered some issues in relation to workforce supply and scheduling over the last couple of weeks, but are resolving these every day and remain committed to providing a security workforce for the start of the London 2012 Games.\" The armed forces were already due to provide some 13,500 personnel to help at the Games, with more available as a contingency plan. Whitehall sources are keen to stress that there is no impact on security at the Games. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will announce more details about the extra troops on Thursday, the Home Office said. In a statement, it said: \"We have agreed to offer help to G4S by revising the level of military support.\" It added the government and all involved were focused on delivering a \"safe and secure Games\". \"Our approach is intelligence-led and risk-based, and we retain the ability to be flexible in our response. \"The government is committing £553m for venue security and we remain confident that we will deliver within budget.\" 'Deeply concerned' Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has said he will write to the home secretary for an explanation to find out what is happening. He said he was \"deeply concerned\" that G4S were now unable to deliver their contract and that \"the Home Office have left contingency plans to the last moment\". And Labour's shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell MP, said there was \"clearly a serious problem\". \"With two weeks to go to the start of the Games, it is imperative that action is taken to ensure that the full and necessary quota of security personnel are in place so that the Games will be safe and secure,\" she said. \"We need to know why the problem has emerged so late in the day and precisely what has been agreed to. \"We also must know whether this affects army commitments elsewhere, which units are providing people and what terms and conditions are given for those who will likely lose periods of leave.\" She added that - in the spirit of the cross-party approach to the Games - it was \"essential that the opposition is kept fully informed of these events as they develop\". G4S said its planning with organising committee Locog and other security agencies allowed for \"a variety of contingencies which have been reviewed in the build-up to the Games.\" A spokesman for the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said: \"The mayor takes the issue of Olympics security extremely seriously, and having the finest and bravest service men and woman in the world at our disposal during the Games should be a source of great comfort.\" The government has previously said a total security force of 23,700 will take care of venue security, including the G4S contingent.

A Canadian-American citizen was also charged with money laundering. The men are also accused of being part of the Wannacry cyber-attack of 2017, which crippled UK health service computer systems on a national scale. Announcing the charges, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers, said North Korea \"has become a criminal syndicate with a flag\". One of the defendants, Park Jin Hyok, was previously charged two years ago for his role in the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures. Mr Park, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il are accused of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. The Department of Justice says the defendants work for the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's military intelligence agency. \"North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers,\" Mr Demers said. All three men are believed to be in North Korea, which does not extradite its citizens to face US charges. The Canadian-American man, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, from Mississauga, Ontario, is accused of being the group's money launderer in a separate case announced on Wednesday. Officials say he has agreed to plead guilty to the charge Satirical source Sony Entertainment Picture's 2014 film, The Interview, is widely believed to have been the initial motive for the attack on the film company. The satirical film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and centres around a fictitious assassination plot against him. The men are also believed to have had a hand in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017. The attack temporarily crippled UK National Health Service (NHS) computer systems and affected more than 150 countries around the world. About 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled. There are broadly three reasons why governments choose cyber-attacks to further their interests: to spy on each-other; to steal intellectual property; or to meddle in politics. This indictment adds further evidence to the theory that North Korea bucks the trend. The politically isolated country is actually far more interested in making money. As the assistant attorney general put it, North Korean hackers are \"the world's leading bank robbers\". Of all the major cyber powers, North Korea has time and time again used its considerable skills to prop up a struggling economy. It's working rather well, too - with well over $1bn in the bank from these hacks alone. While other nations cause chaos and political noise with their hackers, North Korea seems content to quietly continue lining its coffers. The three men hit by the indictment also conducted campaigns targeting US defence and energy contractors. As part of this, Department of State and Pentagon officials were tricked into sharing their credentials so hackers could access their computers. \"The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,\" Acting US Attorney Tracy Wilkison said. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said it fully supported the criminal charges. \"Working with our allies we are committed to countering malicious activity by state and non-state actors and will defend ourselves from disruptive behaviour in cyber-space,\" said the organisation's director for operations, Paul Chichester.", "summary": "三名朝鲜人在美国被起诉，罪名是谋划从世界多地的银行及企业盗窃和勒索超过13亿美元（9.4亿英镑）。"}

About one in five men and one in eight women die from the condition. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Your heart is the most vital organ in the body, but all too often we take it for granted. \"Despite being a largely preventable condition, coronary heart disease is still the UK's single biggest killer, causing unnecessary heartache for thousands of families.\" As well as chest pain, the main symptoms of CHD are heart attacks and heart failure.

Mr McGuinness, a former IRA man and life-long republican, will be among the monarch's guests at Windsor Castle. He met the Queen in 2012, but the visit still holds challenges for Sinn Féin. The UK state visit marks another significant milestone in Anglo-Irish relations and further fascination for those who have followed Mr McGuinness' long journey from paramilitary to politician to palace guest. BBC News looks back at the significant events and political choreography affecting Sinn Féin's relationship with royalty. 1969 The government deploys the Army to Northern Ireland following widespread civil unrest and violent sectarian clashes between Catholics and Protestants. The deployment, known as Operation Banner, was to become the longest continuous campaign in the Army's history. Martin McGuinness, aged about 20, joins the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and quickly becomes an influential figure within the paramilitary organisation in his native Derry. Interviewed by the BBC during a walkabout in the city, a baby-faced McGuinness does not correct the correspondent when he described him as the \"Officer Commanding for the Derry part of the IRA Provisional operation\". Martin McGuinness is sentenced to six months in prison by the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after he was caught in a car containing large quantities of explosives and ammunition. He tells the court he is \"very proud\" of his IRA membership. The Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, is killed by an IRA bomb while on holiday in County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland. Two of his relations and a 15-year old local boy are also killed in the explosion. Hours later, 18 soldiers are killed in a double IRA bombing at Warrenpoint, County Down. It is the highest death toll suffered by the Army in a single incident in Northern Ireland. Martin McGuinness is elected to the British House of Commons as a MP for Mid Ulster. Adhering to Sinn Féin's long-standing policy of abstentionism, he refuses to take his seat or swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. The Good Friday Agreement is signed in Belfast following years of intensive peace talks between political parties in Northern Ireland and the British and Irish governments. Martin McGuiness was Sinn Féin's chief negotiator during the deliberations. The accord paves the way for devolution through a new power-sharing coalition of unionists and nationalists at Stormont. Martin McGuinness, who left school at the age of 15 without any formal qualifications, is appointed as education minister at the Northern Ireland Assembly. The IRA releases a statement saying it has \"formally ordered an end to the armed campaign\". The paramilitary organisation, believed to be responsible for more than 1,700 deaths over a 35-year period, says it it now committed to \"exclusively peaceful means\". Martin McGuinness becomes deputy first minister of Northern Ireland after an election that followed a power-sharing agreement between Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party. He forms an unlikely political relationship with his former foe Ian Paisley, and the pair are quickly nicknamed the Chuckle Brothers. The Queen begins a four-day state visit to the Republic of Ireland, travelling to Dublin, Cork and County Tipperary. It is the first official visit by a British monarch since the foundation of the state. In an itinerary rich in symbolism, the Queen lays a wreath in tribute to Irish rebels who died fighting for independence. She also speaks a few words in the Irish language during her keynote speech at Dublin Castle, once the home of British rule in Ireland. The trip is hailed as a diplomatic success and a \"game changer\" for Anglo-Irish relations. Sinn Féin refuses to meet the Queen during the visit, and Martin McGuinness declines an invitation to the Dublin Castle event, but their stance is viewed by many commentators as out of step with the overwhelming mood of the Irish people. Martin McGuinness announces he wants to become the next Irish president and formally enters the election campaign. He says if he wins the vote, he is prepared to meet all heads of state without exception, including the Queen. Martin McGuinness tells the BBC that that Queen's visit to the Republic of Ireland had \"made an impact\" on him. He commends her use of the Irish language and that she was \"prepared to stand in a very dignified way to honour those patriots who struggled in 1916 to bring about a free and independent 32-county Irish Republic\". Minister Martin McGuinness says it would be \"huge ask\" on the part of any Irish republican to meet the Queen. He criticises the Northern Ireland Office for announcing plans for a Queen's Jubilee party at Stormont at the end of the month, without consulting Sinn Féin. He describes the NIO's conduct as \"insensitive\". Sinn Féin agrees to a historic first meeting with the Queen following a special meeting of the party. Martin McGuinness will not attend the Jubilee party but instead will meet the Queen and shake her hand at a charity reception in Belfast within days. The Queen and Martin McGuinness meet for the first time and shake hands in public and in private at a charity event in Belfast's Lyric Theatre. The historic handshake between a British monarch and a former paramilitary turned politician is hailed as a significant moment in the Irish peace process. Mr McGuinness greets the Queen in the Irish language and tells her that their meeting was a \"powerful signal that peace-building requires leadership\". Martin McGuinness tells BBC Radio Four's Today programme he shook hands with the Queen \"to extend a hand of friendship, peace and reconciliation\" to unionists in the region. When asked by presenter John Humphrys why he was referring to Her Majesty as the Queen and no longer as Mrs Windsor, he explained that \"when people are gracious and step up to the plate we have to reciprocate\". Martin McGuinness raises a few laughs - and perhaps just as many eyebrows - as he reveals he once slept in the Queen's bed at Hillsborough Castle, the official royal residence in Northern Ireland. In an after dinner speech, he tells a business conference that Sinn Féin was assigned the Queen's bedroom during days of devolution negotiations at the castle in 2010. \"I do not want you to tell anybody,\" he tells his chuckling audience, \"but I had a snooze in her bed. She was not in it, so no scandal attached.\" Sinn Féin announces Martin McGuinness will attend a banquet hosted by the Queen during next week's state visit to Britain by Irish President Michael D Higgins. Party president Gerry Adams says the decision had to be viewed against the backdrop of huge political change in recent years. Martin McGuinness praises the Queen for her \"leadership role\" in the Irish peace process. He says she is a \"staunch supporter\" of the Irish peace process and impressed him with her words and deeds during her highly symbolic state visit to the Republic of Ireland in May 2011.", "summary": "爱尔兰总统希金斯星期二（4月8日）开始对英国进行国事访问，这是爱尔兰独立以来国家元首首次正式访问英国。"}

Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued. \"Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,\" a spokesperson said. Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time. The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him. She referred to him as the \"Spiderman of the 18th\", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an \"example for all citizens\". France's new Malian hero Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness.", "summary": "一名马里移民近日在法国成为了英雄人物，他徒手攀登上了四层楼高的公寓，救下了一名悬在阳台外的男童。他的英勇行为受到法国总统表彰，并因此获得法国国籍。"}

Apart from a few scantily-clad women, there is little to suggest this is the headquarters of China's first and biggest chain of pole-dancing training centres, the Luolan Pole Dancing Club. Step inside and you see a forest of steel poles. A few women are warming up. One person stands out. He is the only man in sight and his name is Gong Yifei. \"I'm 24 years old and have loved dancing since I was a child,\" says Mr Gong. \"But lessons were out of the question. I only began as an adult after being mesmerised by an online clip posted by Luolan.\" Battlefield to pole Before taking the leap into the world of pole-dancing, Gong Yifei led a life that could not have been more different. With no training as an artist, he joined the military, the People's Liberation Army, aged 18 and from there the military sent him to train with the armed police force. There he showed enough potential in hostage rescue to earn a promotion to squad leader. He says his decision to abandon the battlefield for the pole baffled many of his dance teachers. He believes that if he had told his friends, they would have been dumbfounded. In contrast, Mr Gong's family has been surprisingly supportive. Training at an advanced level is extremely rigorous and requires discipline. The students spend the first hour stretching before devoting another to building strength. The next half hour is easier, as they work on their own ideas for dance moves. Only after two-and-a-half hours does a choreographed routine begin. After that, it is back to working on building strength, flexibility and practising specific manoeuvres on the poles. The students finally call it quits at half past eight in the evening. Those who are serious follow this regime for five days a week for a total of four gruelling months. 'Accept and respect' Gong Yifei is nearing the end of his training. He has already stumped up nearly 12,000 yuan ($1,750; £1,125). \"I love how pole-dancing has toned my muscles and improved my sense of rhythm,\" he says. \"There's no reason to think men are in any way inferior to women when it comes to dance. Especially when it comes to pole-dancing, where masculine strength is as vital as feminine flexibility.\" Although training clubs like Luolan are springing up across China, pole-dancing is still very much seen as a risque novelty. Mr Gong blames narrow-minded prejudice for the public image of pole-dancing as an erotic performance suitable only for sleazy joints. He has no plans to perform in public - there is too much prejudice and a very limited market for male pole-dancers. Only a few gay bars in big cities use male performers at all. But he is not letting this get in his way. He and his classmates are working towards greater things. Their aim is to become certified coaches to hand on their skills to other enthusiasts. Mr Gong does not think he can make a career out of it. At the moment he depends on his family for money. He knows he will have to find a day job to supplement what income he can generate as a part-time pole-dancing coach. But he has no plans to return to his former life in the security forces, even though he is proud of what he trained to do. And he says he sees no reason why people cannot find beauty or merit in pole-dancing. The genre has given him a voice and freedom he never had - to use how he moves to show exactly how he feels. \"One day, maybe I'll become a part-time coach. I'll help more people understand what pole-dancing is,\" he said. \"I hope more people can learn to accept and respect the art of pole-dancing.\"", "summary": "龚翼飞（音译）离开了武警战士的岗位，选择了一条前途未卜的职业道路。他希望未来成为一名钢管舞教练，并且希望人们以对待艺术的态度来尊重钢管舞。"}

Nasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon. It wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars. Anders, 85, said he's a \"big supporter\" of the \"remarkable\" unmanned programmes, \"mainly because they're much cheaper\". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions. \"What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?\" he said, adding \"I don't think the public is that interested\". Meanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars. Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. In a statement, Nasa said it was \"leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars\". \"That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities.\" In December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon. The crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown. It was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later. But the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. \"Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected.\" Anders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. \"I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,\" he said. \"The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings.\" It's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community. \"I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,\" he explained. His former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic. \"I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,\" he told 5 Live. \"I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that.\" But asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary. \"I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense.\" Apollo's legacy Reflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a \"great endeavour\" and agreed that it had won the space race. Anders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be \"Earthrise\" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: \"When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose here… it sort of dawned me,\" he said. \"And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform. How the play turns out, is up to us.\" Frank Borman and Bill Anders were speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live as part of a special documentary on the 50th anniversary of their historic lunar mission.

Home Office research suggests a fifth of students are still in the UK five years after being granted visas. But the National Union of Students dismissed Mr Green's comments as a \"misinterpretation\" of the facts. The Home Office study tracked non-EU migrants who came to the UK in 2004. The largest group - some 185,000 people - were students, and 21% were still in the country five years later. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says this, together with an increasing number of new overseas students, has led Mr Green to make reform of the student immigration route a priority. 'Out of control' Ministers also intend to examine work visas as two-fifths of people in this group remained in the UK after five years. Ahead of his speech, Mr Green said: \"We can't assume that everyone coming here has skills the UK workforce cannot offer.\" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't want to interfere with the success stories of our universities.\" But he said there was a need to examine closely sub-degree courses and the reasons for students remaining in the UK. Mr Green said: \"Why are they staying on? What are they staying on to do? This is part of a wider look we need to take at the immigration system.\" Office for National Statistics figures released last month showed net migration to the UK increased by 33,000 to 196,000 in 2009. The number of visas issued to students went up by 35% to 362,015. Mr Green said the figures were proof the coalition government had inherited an immigration system \"largely out of control\". In his speech at the Royal Commonwealth Club, Mr Green said an annual cap on economic migrants from outside the EU would not be enough to reduce net immigration to the \"tens of thousands\". 'Politically motivated' Internal Home Office estimates showed more than 90,000 people were coming into Britain every year to do courses below degree level at private institutions, Mr Green said. \"The foreign students attending these various establishments may, or frankly may not be, the brightest and the best. \"I want to ensure those who come here to study at language schools or any other institutions play by the rules and leave when their visas expire. \"We need to decide whether this is right and also whether it is the best thing for the students themselves, given the high financial commitments required of them.\" But Aaron Porter, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"To suggest that the levels of those coming to the UK to study is too high is a politically motivated misinterpretation of the huge contribution which international students make to our colleges, universities and the economy. \"The government should be proud that students choose to study in this country creating an education industry worth £12.5bn a year to the British economy.\" Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: \"Populist policies on immigration might play well domestically, but on the global stage we risk looking foolish. \"Damian Green is making his speech today after returning from a trip to India where he encouraged students to come to the UK.\" Join the debate", "summary": "英国移民事务大臣将宣布，允许入英的外国学生数量将“无法维持”。"}

Some of these new places are called the poles of inaccessibility. Two of them are particularly interesting. One is called the continental pole of inaccessibility - it's the place on Earth furthest from the ocean. There is some debate as to its exact position but it's considered by many to be near the so-called Dzungarian Gate - a mountain pass between China and Central Asia. The equivalent point in the ocean - the place furthest away from land - lies in the South Pacific some 2,700km (1,680 miles) south of the Pitcairn Islands - somewhere in the no-man's land, or rather no-man's-sea, between Australia, New Zealand and South America. This oceanic pole of inaccessibility is not only of interest to explorers, satellite operators are interested in it as well. That's because most of the satellites placed in orbit around the Earth will eventually come down, but where? Smaller satellites will burn up but pieces of the larger ones will survive to reach the Earth's surface. To avoid crashing on a populated area they are brought down near the point of oceanic inaccessibility. Scattered over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) on the ocean floor of this region is a graveyard of satellites. At last count there were more than 260 of them, mostly Russian. The wreckage of the Mir space station lies there. It was launched in 1986 and was visited by many teams of cosmonauts and international visitors. With a mass of 120 tonnes it was never going to burn up in the atmosphere, so it was ditched in the region in 2001 and was seen by some fishermen as a fragmenting mass of glowing debris racing across the sky. Many times a year the supply module that goes to the International Space Station burns up in this region incinerating the station's waste. No one is in any danger because of this controlled re-entry into our atmosphere. The region is not fished because oceanic currents avoid the area and do not bring nutrients to it, making marine life scarce. One future visitor to this desolate place will be the International Space Station. Current plans are for it to be decommissioned in the next decade and it will have to be carefully brought down in the oceanic pole of inaccessibility. With a mass of 450 tonnes - four times that of the Mir space station - it will make a spectacular sight. Sometimes however, it's not possible to bring a satellite or space station down in the South Pacific if ground controllers have lost contact with it. Such a thing happened with the 36-tonne Salyut 7 space station in 1991 which came down in South America or the American Skylab that struck Australia in 1979. No one on the ground was injured, or indeed as far as we know, ever has been hit by a piece of falling spacecraft debris. We will face that problem again next year. Between January and April the Chinese Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth. It was launched in 2011 as China's first space station. The following year it was visited by China's first female astronaut, Liu Yang. Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as it heads towards re-entry. But Chinese engineers have lost control of it and cannot fire its thrusters to bring it down in the South Pacific. Instead it will come down somewhere between 42.8 degrees north and south. That's between the latitude of northern Spain and southern Australia, and we won't be able to be more precise than that until just a few hours before it burns up. Tiangong-1 is one space station that probably won't join its companions in the remote South Pacific.

Lord Hall, who starts next March, said he was \"committed to ensuring our news services are the best in the world\".

Mr Entwistle quit on 10 November, saying that as editor-in chief he had to take \"ultimate responsibility\" for a Newsnight investigation that had led to the former Conservative Party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, being wrongly accused of child abuse. Sixty-one-year-old Lord Hall is due to take over the role - currently occupied by acting director general Tim Davie - in early March, on a salary of £450,000 a year. Culture Secretary Maria Miller offered her congratulations, saying Lord Hall had \"a very strong track record in successfully leading iconic organisations\". She added: \"It is important now that Tony Hall gets to grips quickly - to provide the stability and certainty that the BBC needs, and restore public confidence.\" Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said Lord Hall was an \"excellent choice... the right person to bring stability to the BBC in these difficult times\". 'Long, hard look' Lord Patten said the BBC needed \"to take a long, hard look at the way it operates and put in place the changes required to ensure it lives up to the standards that the public expects... Tony Hall is the right person to lead this.\" He went on: \"Tony Hall has been an insider and is a currently an outsider. \"As an ex-BBC man he understands how the corporation's culture and behaviour make it, at its best, the greatest broadcaster in the world. \"And from his vantage point outside the BBC, he understands the sometimes justified criticisms of the corporation - that it can be inward-looking and on occasions too institutional. \"But perhaps most importantly, given where we now find ourselves, his background in news will prove invaluable as the BBC looks to rebuild both its reputation in this area and the trust of audiences.\" News trainee Lord Hall said: \"This organisation is an incredibly important part of what makes the United Kingdom what it is. And of course it matters not just to people in this country - but to tens of millions around the world too. \"It's been a difficult few weeks - but together we'll get through it.\" Lord Hall joined the BBC as a news trainee in 1973 and during his 28 year career at the corporation oversaw the launch of Radio 5 live, the BBC News Channel, the BBC News website and BBC Parliament. He is believed to have been on the final shortlist for the director general post in 1999 when Greg Dyke was appointed. He began his job at the Royal Opera House in 2001. In 2009 he joined the board of the organising committee for the London Olympics and also set up and chaired the board of the Games' arts festival, the Cultural Olympiad. He was made a cross-bench peer in 2010 as Lord Hall of Birkenhead. Lord Hall, who is currently deputy chairman of Channel 4 and sits on the board of the British Council, will be standing down from these roles before he takes up the post of director general. At the Royal Opera House, Lord Hall has won praise for turning around the business's fortunes. He has widened access to productions through nationwide big screen relays and the purchase of a DVD company to distribute recordings globally. Turnover is reported to have risen from about £45m to £106m under his tenure. Simon Robey, of the Royal Opera House's board of trustees, said: \"I can think of nobody better able to bring stability back to the BBC... He has been a tremendous and inspiring force for good.\" Addressing concerns that the process to appoint Lord Hall had not been transparent, Sir Christopher Bland, former chairman of the BBC governors, said it was \"absolutely right under the circumstances to dispense with a long-drawn out process\". He said Lord Hall was the \"right man... an inspired appointment\". Mr Entwistle's resignation came after the BBC had already spent several weeks at the centre of a scandal over sexual abuse carried out by the late DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

However, CD album sales fell by 13% to 86.2 million discs. Overall, 6% fewer albums were sold than in 2010. The BPI blamed the decline on piracy and accused the government of taking too long to tackle the problem. 'Creative crunch' Digital downloads have recorded rapid growth over recent years. In 2007, only 6.2 million albums were bought as files over the internet according to The Official Charts Company. The year 2011's tally was more than four times that amount. Fifteen albums sold more than 100,000 digital copies, with Adele's 21 proving the most popular. However, shoppers still showed a preference for CDs, buying more than three times the number of albums on disc than downloads. The BPI said that \"physical ownership\" still played an important role, but said \"a backdrop of chronic piracy\" posed risks to the music industry. \"While other countries take positive steps to protect their creative sector, our government is taking too long to act on piracy, while weakening copyright to the benefit of the US tech giants,\" said Geoff Taylor, the BPI's chief executive. \"The UK has already fallen behind Germany as a music market. Unless decisive action is taken in 2012, investment in music could fall again - a creative crunch that will destroy jobs.\" Letters The government is pursuing a plan that would involve rights holders sending lists of internet addresses suspected of illegal downloads to internet service providers (ISPs). The ISPs would then send a letter to suspected account holders, saying that their account had been identified as being used to download copyright infringing material. They would offer advice on how to prevent such illegal activity, but would not make demands for money or threaten disconnection. By contrast, France has passed a law that allows pirates to be blocked from the net from one year after three infringements. A spokesman for the UK Department for Culture Media and Sport said: \"We will continue to work with industry on how they can better tackle online piracy but this is not an issue that ISPs or rights holders alone can deal with\". \"All elements of the internet industry - payment companies, advertisers, search engines, ISPs and rights holders - need to play their part in tackling unlawful activity online.\" Streaming While piracy may be partly to blame for the drop in album sales, the data also suggests changing buying habits.

One industry watcher said this underlined the fact that shoppers had become more choosy. \"People now buy the individual songs they like rather than buying the whole album because they like a single,\" said Philip Buxton, an independent digital media consultant. \"So they might buy the single and then use services like Spotify and Lastfm to listen to the other tracks and are then much more selective about what they purchase. \"The implication for the record industry is that they need to embrace this new model rather than fight it.\"", "summary": "2011年，英国数码音乐销量（也称网络音乐销量）继续攀升，但唱片销量总体下降。"}

Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this \"irreversible pathway\". Their study shows it could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse. So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. \"What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,\" co-author Prof Johan Rockström, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News. \"We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium.\" Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade. In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term \"feedback processes\". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor. The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes. What exactly is a Hothouse Earth scenario? In short, it's not good. According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be \"massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,\" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. Are the current heatwaves in the UK and Europe evidence of a Hothouse Earth? The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. \"One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,\" said Prof Rockström. \"It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought.\" Surely we've known about these risks before? What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an \"irreversible pathway\" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Any good news here at all? Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. \"Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. \"This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,\" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. What do other scientists say? Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. \"As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',\" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. \"Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for ‒ thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth.\" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. \"Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,\" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. \"At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.\"", "summary": "乍眼一看，这有点像是低成本科幻电影的标题，但对于行星学家来说，“温室地球”是一个非常严肃的理论。"}

But many Crimeans loyal to Kiev boycotted the referendum, and the EU and US condemned it as illegal. Pro-Russian forces took control of Crimea in February after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president was overthrown. On the ballot paper, voters were asked whether they would like Crimea to rejoin Russia. A second question asked whether Crimea should return to its status under the 1992 constitution, which would give the region much greater autonomy. There was no option for those who wanted the constitutional situation to remain unchanged. Ethnic Russians make up 58.5% of the region's population, and many of them were expected to vote for joining Russia. One voter, Olga Koziko, told the BBC that she was voting for secession because she did not want to be governed by \"those Nazis who came to power in Kiev\". \"Russia will defend us and protect us,\" the schoolteacher said. There are 1.5 million eligible voters and election officials put the turnout in Sunday's vote at more than 80%. Ethnic Tatars, who make up 12% of the population, mostly boycotted the election. Sergei Aksyonov, who was installed as Crimea's regional government leader after Russia's military takeover, said a session of parliament would take place on Monday. \"The Supreme Soviet of Crimea will make an official application for the republic to join the Russian Federation at a meeting on March 17,\" he said on Twitter after the vote. But White House spokesman Jay Carney condemned the vote as \"dangerous and destabilising\" and said it would have \"increasing costs for Russia\". The US has previously threatened to impose sanctions on Russia. The European Union said the vote was \"illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised\". EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday and are expected to consider imposing sanctions on Russian officials. Away from the Crimea region, unrest continued in the south-east Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian protesters stormed the prosecutor's building shouting \"Donetsk is a Russian city\", and then broke into the local security services headquarters for the second time in two days. They later dispersed but promised to return on Monday. The protesters are demanding that the prosecutor release a pro-Russian leader, Pavel Gubarev. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had told German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone he was concerned by escalating tensions in Donetsk, blaming \"radical groups\" which had the consent of Kiev. Mr Putin told Mrs Merkel that Sunday's referendum was legal and Moscow would respect the result. The German chancellor's spokesman said she had proposed expanding the presence of international observers from the OSCE in eastern Ukraine and that Mr Putin had welcomed the plan. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that the authorities would track down separatist \"ringleaders\". \"We will find all of them - if it takes one year, two years - and bring them to justice and try them in Ukrainian and international courts,\" he said. In other developments: Russia on Saturday vetoed a draft UN resolution criticising the vote - the only Security Council member to vote against it. Moscow's main ally China abstained, ensuring Russia's isolation. The Crimean region was part of Russia until 1954 and Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in Ukrainian ports. But Moscow has signed agreements promising to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity.", "summary": "克里米亚举行投票决定是否脱离乌克兰重返俄罗斯，投票站口民调显示：约93%的投票支持克里米亚重返俄罗斯。"}

The Flood, the opening track from the man band's first album as a reunited five-piece, begins with lush strings as Williams belts out: \"Standing on the edge of forever, at the start of whatever.\" It's a beginning that would sit well on any Williams solo album from 2000's Sing When You're Winning onwards. Not to be outdone, Gary Barlow stamps his mark with a trademark rising middle eight heralding a chorus that owes much to four-piece 2005-2009 Take That. It offers a tantalising glimpse of the best of both worlds. But Progress' first single is not typical of the album. While Robbie's input feels like an extension of his solo material, contributions from Gary, Mark and the other two are distinctly different from their last two releases, Beautiful World and the Circus. Don't expect a Patience, Rule The World or Greatest Day. Take That mark three - as the album title suggests - is all about reinvention. Thanks to the album's producer, Madonna collaborator Stuart Price, it's electro-tinged reinvention. On paper, an electrofied Take That shouldn't work. But Price's fusion of chugging synth lines, a mixture of synthesized and real drums, and subtle harmonies pushes things forward. Williams wordplay brings another dimension throughout - Barlow would never have written \"we'll be practising our politics, defending all our policies, preparing for apocalypse\", from possible single SOS. This is the album Rudebox - Williams' disappointing 2006 sonic experiment - could have been. Ballad-free zone But while Progress is likely to be lauded by critics, Take That are steering a brave, new course given Rudebox's alienation of the core Williams audience. Female pop fans in their late 30s/early 40s are not necessarily the biggest fans of electro-rock. Those same fans will be wondering why they can't find a Barlow ballad. Wait, with its opening piano and high, cinematic strings, threatens to be just that before an electronic breakbeat unexpectedly kicks in. The closest we get to a Barlow epic is Eight Letters - \"when I went away, what I forgot to say, was all I had to say, eight words, three words, one meaning\". But even here, the usual opening piano chords are replaced with a distorted solo synth. Kidz, featuring Owen in the verse and a heavily-processed Williams in the chorus, is a definite contender for second single, sounding as it does like a cross between Sam Sparro's Black and Gold, and Feel Good Inc by Damon Albarn's Gorillaz. It faces strong competition from Happy Now which, along with The Flood and delicate duet Pretty Things, features Barlow and Williams on lead vocals. The harmony-drenched chorus of \"I feel myself falling, I'm feeling happy now\" is the only moment reminiscent of five-piece 1990s Take That - think Everything Changes 2010. It's also the most uplifting moment. Williams' return to the fold has brought a moodier edge to Take That's usually breezy sound. Mark Owen, meanwhile - making a pitch to become Take That's George Harrison - performs admirably on his songs, SOS and What Do You Want From Me? Both sound like The Killers - whose last album Day & Age was produced by one Stuart Price - particularly Owen's Mr Brightside-alike What Do You Want From Me? Howard Donald gets his moment on the super-high, super-fast Affirmation while, in Jason Orange's hidden track Flower Bed, Price creates a shimmering wall of sound. Williams' vocals are the most prominent on Progress and, on the surface, it's the first Take That album not dominated by Barlow. But don't be fooled. Williams now calls his former nemesis \"the captain\" while Barlow has confirmed he \"still leads the trail\". His musical input into this album, as with all Take That releases, is vast. For all the progress made in the latest gear change of the Take That rollercoaster, Gary Barlow is still the leader of the band that was formed around him. Progress is released in the UK on Monday.", "summary": "罗比·威廉姆斯（Robbie Williams）再次脱离男声组合Take That（又称“接招乐队”），去实现他的念念不忘的走单帮理想。"}

Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong worked for a company called Huaying Haitai and in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the US court filing says. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that from at least 2006 until 2018, the two extensively hacked into computer systems with the aim of stealing intellectual property and confidential business and technological information from: The FBI said they had also hacked into US Navy computer systems and stolen the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel. FBI director Christopher Wray said the two men were at present \"beyond US jurisdiction\". 'Economic aggression' Announcing the unsealing of the indictments, US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said China had violated a 2015 agreement under which it had pledged to not engage in commercial cyber-spying. Mr Rosenstein said his department's move had been co-ordinated with US allies in Europe and Asia to rebuff \"China's economic aggression\". He added: \"We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities.\" The UK government said it was joining allies in holding the Chinese government responsible for a global campaign targeting commercial secrets. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world. \"These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets.\" Australia and New Zealand said they too held China responsible for the global hacking campaign and joined their \"like-minded partners\" in condemning the activity. 'Chinese hackers return' By Gordon Corera, security correspondent This is the latest salvo in Washington's attempt to pressure Beijing on a range of issues, with economic espionage one of the most high-profile. US and UK officials are reluctant to name the companies that have been hit but they say the economic damage has been significant. The hackers, officials say, work under the direction of China's Ministry of State Security - one of the country's intelligence organisations. \"It is organised more like a corporation than a gang,\" one UK official says, adding that British intelligence has the highest level of confidence in their assessment of who was responsible. The UK and US believe China is breaking a 2015 agreement not to steal commercial data to help its companies. There was a dip in activity after the deal was signed (which followed a period of pressure by Washington, including the indictment of Chinese military hackers and the threat of sanctions). But US and UK sources both say that recently they have seen Chinese hackers return, now operating more stealthily, whereas in the past they were easier to spot. Where the US has been vocal in recent months, this is the first time the UK has spoken out - perhaps because it has been concerned about risking trade ties and getting pulled into the Trump administration's broader confrontation with Beijing. UK officials say they have raised the matter privately a number of times with Beijing over the last two years, including during the prime minister's visit earlier this year, and officials are keen to stress that they think the relationship with China is strong enough to allow them to address these issues without causing wider problems.", "summary": "美国司法部起诉两名中国公民，指他们是受中国政府指使、盗窃海外高科技公司机密的情报机关黑客。"}

The drugs, tested on 257 women, target a specific weakness found in one-in-ten breast cancers. Experts said the findings were a \"stepping stone\" to tailored cancer care. The doctors leading the trial had not expected or even intended to achieve such striking results. They were investigating how drugs changed cancers in the short window between a tumour being diagnosed and the operation to remove it. But by the time surgeons came to operate, there was no sign of cancer in some patients. Prof Judith Bliss, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the impact was \"dramatic\". She told the BBC News website: \"We were particularly surprised by these findings as this was a short-term trial. \"It became apparent some had a complete response. It's absolutely intriguing, it is so fast.\" The drugs were lapatinib and trastuzumab, which is more widely known as Herceptin. They both target HER2 - a protein that fuels the growth of some women's breast cancers. Herceptin works on the surface of cancerous cells while lapatinib is able to penetrate inside the cell to disable HER2. The study, which also took place at NHS hospitals in Manchester, gave the treatment to women with tumours measuring between 1 and 3cm. In less than two weeks of treatment, the cancer disappeared entirely in 11% of cases, and in a further 17% they were smaller than 5mm. Current therapy for HER2 positive breast cancers is surgery, followed by chemotherapy and Herceptin. But Prof Bliss believes the findings could eventually mean some women do not need chemotherapy. However, that will require larger studies especially as HER2 positive cancers have a higher risk of coming back. \"We would have to be very clear we're not taking a backwards step and increasing the risk of relapse,\" Prof Bliss added. Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: \"We hope this particularly impressive combination trial will serve as a stepping stone to an era of more personalised treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. \"Such a rapid response to treatment could soon give doctors the unprecedented ability to identify women responding so well that they would not need gruelling chemotherapy.\" Breast cancer is now thought of as at least ten separate diseases, each with a different cause, life expectancy and needing a different treatment. Matching the specific errors in a tumour to targeted drugs is considered the future of cancer medicine. Breast cancers, and particularly HER2 positive tumours, are at the forefront of this revolution in treatment. Prof Arnie Purushotham, from Cancer Research UK which funded the study, said: \"These results are very promising if they stand up in the long run, and could be the starting step of finding a new way to treat HER2 positive breast cancers.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "英国科学家称，他们研发的一种新药可以在一周之内杀灭胰腺癌细胞。"}

Footage of the verdict was widely circulated via influential media on the popular social network Sina Weibo and YouTube-like video site Miaopai. Publicly paraded The Beijing News' footage of the hearing has been viewed more than three million times since it was posted on Saturday. It shows convicts being surrounded by armed guards and led onto raised platforms to individually receive their sentences. Thousands of people can be seen in the background watching the spectacle. After they have been sentenced, they are then led onto another platform on the back of a police car surrounded by armed guards and are driven away. For some of them, the journey is directly to the firing range. Verdicts on murder, robbery and drug-related offences are read out at the hearing, but the paper only highlights that it is those found guilty of drug offences that were \"immediately\" executed. 'The Cultural Revolution has come back' The video has been criticised by human rights activists and online users alike. Amnesty International's William Nee said on Twitter: \"The Chinese authorities have once again displayed a blatant disregard for human life and dignity\". Many on Sina Weibo say that the video makes them think of a bygone era, saying that the method of public shaming makes them think that \"the Cultural Revolution has come back\". Some Chinese online users also voice their concerns about the apparent ease at which capital punishment rulings are seemingly handed out. There have been a number of notorious instances where the police have forced confessions out of innocent people, who have then been subsequently executed, such as the case of Nie Shubin. China carries out more executions than any other country in the world. There are no official statistics on how many are carried out, but it is widely believed that the number extends into the thousands. The 'Breaking Bad village' Some online spectators argue that the method, although ugly, is necessary, given the city's reputation. Lufeng has been keen to stamp out its reputation as a hot bed for the production of ketamine and crystal methamphetamine, many of which is trafficked into areas of East Asia and Asia Pacific. Since 2014, Lufeng has been known as \"the city of ice\" owing to the notorious large-scale production of synthetic drugs in the region. One of its villages, Boshe, has also been dubbed \"the Breaking Bad village\" by the international press. And it has done little to shake this reputation. In March, the China National Narcotics Control Commission told media that China's seizure of synthetic drugs including methamphetamine and ketamine has \"surged by 106 per cent year on year in 2016\". The official Xinhua News Agency said in November this year that the region is \"plagued with rampant drug production and trafficking\". \"Over a third of meth consumed in China originates from Boshe and neighbouring villages\", it says, and adds that a startling \"one in five families is directly involved in drug production\". It notes that the police had solved over 13,000 drugs cases and seized 10 tonnes of drugs between January and October of this year in the region alone.

At least 12 shacks were set ablaze, reports say. The demolition teams appeared to leave inhabited huts intact as they move through the camp's southern sector. The government plans to relocate migrants to reception centres. Those living in the camp, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, hope to cross the Channel, often using people traffickers to try to enter illegally. At the scene: Anna Holligan, BBC News, Calais Hidden by the cover of darkness, groups of migrants tried to access trucks on the motorway heading towards the port of Calais. Riot police fired tear gas, forcing them back. On Monday the demolition squads moved through the Jungle. They were met by some resistance. A few migrants and protesters threw rocks in an effort to delay their eviction. Little remains of the sprawling southern section of the settlement now. The government is trying to encourage people to relocate to official accommodation provided inside converted shipping containers nearby. But most have refused the offer, fearing they'll be forced to claim asylum in France. It's still unclear where the hundreds who've been evicted will go now. They fear the changes mean they will be forced to give their fingerprints and claim asylum in France, dashing their dreams of reaching the UK. The authorities believe some 1,000 migrants will be affected by the eviction plan while aid agencies say the number of people living there is much higher. 'Iron bars' Clashes continued on Monday evening as groups of migrants fanned out across scrubland towards the motorway heading to the port of Calais, reports the BBC's Anna Holligan at the camp. French media say about 150 people, some wielding iron bars, climbed onto the road to block vehicles. Riot police pushed them back into the camp. Earlier water cannon were also used to extinguish a fire in the shacks at the camp. About 100 homes were dismantled on Monday, with demolition teams expected to return the next morning, our correspondent says. At least four people, including activists from the UK-based No Borders group, were arrested during the unrest, police say. 'No access' Earlier Good Chance, a theatre group which works in the camp, said police were preventing volunteers from entering the camp. \"No volunteers access,\" it said in a tweet. \"People removed from houses. Police blocking entry. This is what they call a 'soft demolition'.\" French officials say public areas in the camp such as places of worship or schools will not be affected and describe the clearance as a \"humanitarian operation\". Conditions in the southern sector are squalid and the camp's sprawling presence has become a controversial issue in both France and the UK. The Jungle in numbers Tea, rivalry and ambition at 'Jungle hotel' Jungle migrants prepare to move Migrants resist relocation to containers Officials say migrants can either move into heated container accommodation in the northern sector of the camp, where there is room for 1,500 people, move to similar accommodation centres elsewhere in France or claim asylum in France. But many residents are reluctant to leave the Calais area. \"Going to Britain... is what people [here] want,\" Afghan migrant Hayat Sirat told AP. \"So destroying part of the jungle is not the solution.\"", "summary": "法国工人和推土机开进了加莱市（Calais）附近名为“丛林”的简陋难民营地，开始拆除数百座临时搭建的棚屋，期间防暴警察和难民爆发了冲突。"}

The worldwide league table ranks 140 cities on a range of factors, including political and social stability, crime, education and access to healthcare. In the survey, Manchester saw the biggest improvement of any European city, rising by 16 places to rank 35th. Manchester's rise puts it ahead of London in the rankings by 13 places, the widest gap between the two cities since the survey began two decades ago. The EIU said Manchester's jump in the rankings was due to an improved security score. 'Resilience' The survey was criticised last year for demoting Manchester after the Manchester Arena attack which killed 22 victims. This year, survey editor Roxana Slavcheva said Manchester had \"shown resilience in the city's recovery from a recent, high-profile terrorist attack, which previously shook up stability\". Ms Slavcheva said security had also improved in \"several western European cities\" and Vienna's top place in the rankings reflected \"a relative return to stability across much of Europe\". It was also praised for its lack of petty crime, described as one of the safest cities in Europe. According to the survey, nearly half of the cities have seen their liveability ranking improve over the past year. Melbourne, which was ranked second in this year's global rankings, had previously come top for seven years running. Two other Australian cities also made this year's top ten: Sydney and Adelaide.

But worshippers refused to back down. One resident said they would not \"let the government touch the mosque\". China has a Muslim minority of some 23 million, and Islam has been prominent in Ningxia for centuries. But human rights groups say there is increasing official hostility towards Muslims in China, and foreign religious influences in particular. The mosque, which has several soaring minarets and domes, is built in a Middle Eastern style. For centuries Hui Muslim mosques were built in a more Chinese style, and it appears that the new structure is viewed by the local government as an example of a growing Arabisation of Chinese Islam, the BBC's China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, reports. How did the protests begin? Officials had on 3 August posted a notice that the mosque would be \"forcibly demolished\" as it had not been granted the necessary planning and construction permits. The notice was shared online among the ethnic Hui Muslim community, according to Reuters news agency. Many questioned why the authorities had not stopped construction of the mosque, which took two years to complete, if it had not been granted relevant permits, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper. Protests were held outside the mosque on Thursday and continued into Friday, say the reports. Pictures circulating on Chinese social media showed large crowds gathering outside the large white building. One resident said talks between the Hui community and the government had reached an impasse. \"We're just in a standoff,\" the resident, who withheld his name, told the Post. \"The public won't let the government touch the mosque, but the government is not backing down.\" However, an official from the local Islamic Association said that the mosque would not be demolished entirely. He told Reuters news agency the government only wanted the structure \"renovated to reduce its scale\". Later reports suggested that the authorities had agreed to remove eight domes. But one of the protesters was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that this proposal was unacceptable to the Muslim community. The protester added that the mosque had been conducting prayers attended by thousands of people and had been built with donations from congregants. There has been no comment so far in Chinese state media. Can you freely practise religion in China? In theory, China's constitution guarantees religious freedom but in practice religious activities remain tightly controlled by the government. Christian churches, for example, have in the past been forced to remove crosses from their roofs, after the government said the symbol broke planning rules. In recent years, the atheistic Chinese Communist Party has become particularly wary of foreign religious influences and authorities have embarked on a campaign to \"sinicise religion\" - ie make it more Chinese. As part of that, they have targeted unofficial \"house churches\" connected to overseas missions where millions of Chinese Christians worship. While Hui Muslims have largely been well-integrated and left mostly free to practise their religion, they have watched as Uighur Muslims in the western Xinjiang region have faced growing government pressure. Rights groups say citizens in Xinjiang are subject to increasingly intrusive methods of government surveillance and control, with many punished for \"extremist\" behaviour like wearing veils in public places, or refusing to watch public TV programmes. Thousands of Uighurs are also believed to have been forcibly sent to \"education camps\". According to Human Rights Watch, detainees are forced to renounce their ethnic and religious identities. But the current move to demolish the Ningxia mosque is an indication that the government is now looking to extend control over other Muslim ethnic minorities, says rights group Amnesty International. Earlier this year, in neighbouring Gansu province, children under 16 in the region of Linxia were banned from religious activities, in a move that alarmed Hui imams. \"It's clear that the Chinese government's hostility towards Muslims in China is not only limited to Uighurs,\" researcher Patrick Poon told the BBC. \"Hui Muslims are generally considered less vulnerable to crackdowns, but this incident proves that the government is determined to use a holistic and heavy-handed approach towards all Muslim ethnic minorities in China.\" Hui people in China", "summary": "中国西部的宁夏回族自治区同心县，数百名穆斯林与当地政府对峙，以保护当地的清真寺不被拆除。"}

Russia said it fired cruise missiles for a fourth day against IS targets. The long-range missiles were launched from Caspian Sea warships. Some missiles hit IS in strategically important Deir al-Zour, reports say. The IS-held town in eastern Syria lies between the IS self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa and territory that the jihadists also control in neighbouring Iraq. Deir al-Zour province is also rich in oil. The Russian military says it fired 18 cruise missiles on Friday, destroying seven \"Islamist\" targets in Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo provinces. Col Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for US Central Command, said the Russian air strikes in recent days targeted more IS areas, including the group's oil infrastructure. But he added that \"the majority of Russian air strikes are still against moderate Syrian opposition forces, which is clearly concerning, and those strikes are in support of the Syrian regime\" of President Bashar al-Assad. 'Revenge for our dead' A monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian and Russian warplanes conducted 50 bombing raids in Deir al-Zour province - Russia's most intense assault there to date. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says that in the Russian defence ministry video soldiers can be seen writing messages on the bombs before loading them onto the aircraft - phrases like: \"This is revenge for our dead\" and \"This is for Paris\". In four days of heavy bombing against IS, the ministry said, more than 100 cruise missiles were launched and more than 800 \"terrorist\" targets destroyed in Syria. Mr Putin said Russia still faced a lot of work. He expressed hope that the next phases would \"produce the expected result\", but did not clarify what those phases would be.

{"source_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50435014", "target_url": "https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/business-53904399", "text": "In early June 2016 a 36-year-old businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova walked on stage at Wembley Arena in front of thousands of adoring fans. She was dressed, as usual, in an expensive ballgown, wearing long diamond earrings and bright red lipstick. She told the cheering crowd that OneCoin was on course to become the world's biggest cryptocurrency \"for everyone to make payments everywhere\". Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the biggest and best-known - its rise in value from a few cents to hundreds of dollars per coin by mid-2016 had given rise to a frenzy of excitement among investors. Cryptocurrency as an idea was just entering the mainstream. Lots of people were looking to get involved in this strange new opportunity. OneCoin, Dr Ruja told the Wembley audience, was the \"Bitcoin Killer\". \"In two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin any more!\" she shouted. All over the world, people were already investing their savings into OneCoin, hoping to be part of this new revolution. Documents leaked to the BBC show that British people spent almost €30m on OneCoin in the first six months of 2016, €2m of it in a single week - and the rate of investment could have increased after the Wembley extravaganza. Between August 2014 and March 2017 more than €4bn was invested in dozens of countries. From Pakistan to Brazil, from Hong Kong to Norway, from Canada to Yemen… even Palestine. But there was something very important these investors didn't know. To explain this, I need first to explain briefly how a cryptocurrency actually works. This is notoriously difficult - go online and you'll find hundreds of different descriptions, some of them utterly baffling to the non-specialist. But this is the first principle to grasp: money is only valuable because other people think it's valuable. Whether it's Bank of England notes and coins, shells, precious stones or matchsticks - all of which have historically been used as money - it only works when everyone trusts it. For a long time, people have tried to create a form of digital money independent of state-backed currencies. But they have always failed because no-one could trust them. They would always need someone in charge who could manipulate the supply, and forgery was too easy. The reason so many people are excited by Bitcoin is that it solves that problem. It depends upon a special type of database called a blockchain, which is like a huge book - one that Bitcoin owners have independent but identical copies of. Every time a Bitcoin is sent from me to someone else, a record of that transaction goes into everyone's book. Nobody - not banks, not governments, or the person who invents it - is in charge or can change it. There is some very clever maths behind all this, but this means that Bitcoins can't be faked, they can't be hacked and can't be double-spent. (I tested this explanation on my mother, the family technophobe, and she told me I'd failed to make it clear enough and should start again. So don't worry too much if you don't follow it either.) The key point is that these special blockchain databases are what make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. For its fans this is a revolutionary new form of currency, with the potential to sideline the banks and national currencies, and provide banking for anyone with a mobile phone. And if you get in early, there's the chance to make a fortune. Dr Ruja's genius was to take all of this and sell the idea to the masses. But there was something wrong. In early October 2016 - four months after Dr Ruja's London appearance - a blockchain expert called Bjorn Bjercke was called by a recruitment agent, with a curious job offer. A cryptocurrency start-up from Bulgaria was looking for a chief technical officer. Bjercke would get an apartment and a car - and an attractive annual salary of about £250,000. \"I was thinking: 'What is my job going to be? What are the things that I'm going to have to do for this company?'\" he recalls. \"And he said: 'Well, first of all, they need a blockchain. They don't have a blockchain today.' \"I said: 'What? You told me it was a cryptocurrency company.'\" The agent replied that this was correct. It was a cryptocurrency company, and it had been running for a while - but it didn't have a blockchain. \"So we need you to build a blockchain,\" he went on. \"What's the name of the company?\" asked Bjercke. \"It's OneCoin.\" He didn't take the job. Jen McAdam's 'tycoon' package One spring day a few months earlier, Jen McAdam received a message from a friend about an unmissable investment opportunity. Sitting at her computer, the Glaswegian clicked on a link and joined a OneCoin webinar. Over the next hour or so she listened carefully to people talking enthusiastically about this exciting new cryptocurrency - how it could transform her fortunes. All of them were \"very up-tempo, full of beans, full of passion\", she remembers. \"You are so lucky that you're seeing this webinar right now,\" she was told. \"You're in at such an early stage and it's just going to go like Bitcoin. It's going to go bigger.\" The webinar hosts talked about Dr Ruja's glittering background: Oxford University, a PhD from Konstanz, a stint with the respected management consultancy, McKinsey and Company... A speech Dr Ruja had given at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine was shown - and that's what clinched it for McAdam. \"That ticked a box... The power of the woman - well done! I felt proud of her.\" By the time the webinar had finished she had decided to invest €1,000. It was easy: you purchased OneCoin tokens, and these then generated coins, which went into your account. One day soon, she was told, she would be able to turn these coins back into euros or pounds. It seemed like easy money. Maybe €1,000 wasn't enough? The promoters said it was the larger packages that were really life-changing. The smallest package cost €140, but they went all the way up to €118,000. One week later McAdam bought a \"tycoon\" package, for €5,000. Before long, she had invested €10,000 of her own money - and persuaded friends and family to invest €250,000 of theirs. She watched excitedly on the OneCoin website as the value of her coins steadily rose. Before too long they had passed £100,000 - a 10-fold return. She started planning holidays and shopping trips. But towards the end of the year Jen McAdam was contacted by a stranger on the internet. He claimed to be a good Samaritan, someone who had studied OneCoin carefully and wanted to speak to people who had invested. Reluctantly, she agreed to a conversation on Skype. It turned out to be a shouting match, but it would send McAdam's life in a new direction. The stranger was Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast and cryptocurrency advocate. He thought OneCoin would give cryptocurrencies a bad name, and he told McAdam bluntly that it was a scam - \"the biggest scam in the [expletive] world\". He said he could prove it, too. \"Well then prove it to me!\" she replied, sharply. Over the next several weeks, Curry sent a stream of information about how cryptocurrencies work: links, articles, YouTube videos. He introduced her to Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain developer who said there was no blockchain. It took McAdam three months to go through it all, but questions were starting to form. She started asking the leaders of her OneCoin group if there was a blockchain. At first she was told it was something she didn't need to know, but when she persisted she finally got the truth in a voicemail in April 2017. \"OK Jen… they don't want to disclose that kind of information, just in case something goes wrong where the blockchain is being held. And plus, as an application, it doesn't need a server behind it. So it's our blockchain technology, a SQL server with a database.\" But by this stage, thanks to Curry and Bjercke, she knew that a standard SQL server database was no basis for a genuine cryptocurrency. The manager of the database could go in and change it at will. \"I thought, 'What???' And literally my legs just went, and I fell on the floor,'\" she says. The inescapable conclusion was that those rising numbers on the OneCoin website were meaningless - they were just numbers typed into a computer by a OneCoin employee. Far from putting an end to their financial worries, she and her friends and family had thrown a quarter of a million euros away. Dr Ruja disappears Although Jen McAdam had now seen the light, few other OneCoin investors had. Dr Ruja was still travelling the world to sell her vision - hopping from Macau to Dubai to Singapore, filling out arenas, pulling in new investors. OneCoin was still growing fast, and Dr Ruja was starting to spend her new fortune: buying multi-million-dollar properties in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and the Black Sea resort of Sozopol. In her downtime she would throw parties on her luxurious yacht The Davina. At one, in July 2017, the American pop star Bebe Rexha performed a private set. Despite the successful facade, trouble was brewing. The opening of a long-promised exchange that would allow OneCoin to be turned into cash kept being delayed - and investors were growing more and more concerned. This was to be resolved at a large gathering of European OneCoin promoters in Lisbon, Portugal, in October 2017. But when the day came, Dr Ruja - who was famously punctual - didn't show up. \"She was on her way. Nobody knew why she wasn't there,\" recalls one delegate. Frantic calls and messages went unanswered. The head office in Sofia, where she was such an imposing presence, didn't know anything either. Dr Ruja had vanished. Some feared she'd been killed or kidnapped by the banks, who - they'd been told - had most to fear from the cryptocurrency revolution. In fact, she had gone underground. FBI records presented in court documents earlier this year indicate that on 25 October 2017, just two weeks after her Lisbon no-show, she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens. And then went completely off radar. That was the last time anyone saw or heard from Dr Ruja. MLM's most successful product Igor Alberts is wearing black-and-gold everything. Black-and-gold shoes, black-and-gold pleated suit, black-and-gold shirt, black-and-gold sunglasses, and he has a thick black-and-gold ring on. And every item of clothing is Dolce and Gabbana. \"When you look at my clothes, they are disciplined,\" he says. His wife, Andreea Cimbala, nods along, adding that if he wakes up and puts on pink underwear, he sticks to pink as he chooses his shirt, trousers and jacket. They live in an enormous house in an affluent neighbourhood on the outskirts of Amsterdam. At the gated entrance to their mansion is a 10ft-high wrought iron gate with their names and the slogan \"What dreams may come\". A Maserati and Aston Martin are parked outside. Alberts was brought up in a poor neighbourhood. Then he got into network marketing, or multi-level marketing (MLM) as it is often known, and started making money. Lots of money. He claims he has made €100m over the last 30 years. Here is how multi-level marketing works. I pay £100 to start selling vitamin tablets directly to people. I sell a box to my friends, Georgia and Phil, and make a small cut. But then I recruit Georgia and Phil to start selling too, and I make a cut on their sales as well. They are now in what's called my downline. Phil and Georgia both recruit two people, and then all four of them recruit two more, and so on. This mushrooms very rapidly - 25 rounds of recruitment later and everyone in the UK would be selling vitamins. (And I, at the top, would be making a cut on all the sales.) MLM is not illegal. Big companies like Amway and Herbalife use these techniques. But it is controversial, because usually only a small number of people make all the money. It's also notorious for exaggerated promises of high earnings and tough sales targets. When there is nothing of value to sell, though, and all the money is made by recruiting other people, it is illegal and goes by another name: a pyramid scheme. In May 2015, already a very successful MLM seller, Igor Alberts was invited to a OneCoin event in Dubai, where he met lots of people, all apparently making fortunes with this new currency. Dr Ruja herself made a powerful impression too, with her \"princess's dresses\" and her vision of a financial revolution. Igor returned with a new mission - and gave new instructions to all the salespeople in his downline: stop whatever you're doing, and start selling OneCoin. \"We gathered the teams together and we started to work like crazy,\" he says. \"We made in our first month almost €90,000 out of nothing. Bang!\" Dr Ruja's genius was to recognise that established MLM sellers with huge downlines were the perfect vehicle to market her fake coin - a plan the FBI says she privately referred to as \"the bitch of Wall Street, meets MLM\". This was the secret of OneCoin's success. It wasn't just a fake cryptocurrency, it was an old-fashioned pyramid scheme, with the fake coin as its \"product\". No wonder it spread like wildfire. Fairly soon Igor Alberts was making more than €1m a month from OneCoin, which quickly became the biggest product in network marketing. \"No other company even came close,\" Alberts says. Sixty per cent of the income Igor Alberts and Andreea Cimbala made from OneCoin (in the end, more than €2m per month) was paid in cash, the rest in OneCoin. But they used some of this cash to buy more OneCoin. They, like almost everyone else involved, were convinced they were earning a fortune. \"I did the calculation how many coins we needed to become the richest person on the planet,\" Igor says. \"I said to Andreea, 'We need to build it up to 100 million coins, because when this coin goes to €100 and we have 100 million, we are richer than Bill Gates.' It's mathematic. It's easy as that.\" The nature of MLM networks - where people often recruit others who are close to them - creates a blurred sense of responsibility. Blame is not easy to apportion. And if sellers have invested their own money, they are victims too. After Dr Ruja's non-appearance in Lisbon, a point came when Igor Alberts, like Jen McAdam, asked to see evidence of the blockchain. He didn't get it, and in December 2017 he quit. I ask if he felt guilty, for having sold so many people a coin that didn't exist, and for having made so much money in the process. \"I felt responsibility. Not guilt,\" he replies. \"You can never be blamed for believing in something. I had no clue that it could be false. I didn't even know what is a blockchain… What doubt can I have?\" He points out that he spent millions buying OneCoin, possibly more than anyone else. By contrast, Jen McAdam says she bears a heavy burden of guilt. I ask her how much she earned from selling OneCoin and she says it was €3,000 - €1,800 of which she received in cash, and which she used to buy more OneCoin. She feels guilty towards those who she introduced to OneCoin, she says, but also towards her late father, a miner, who worked hard all his life in horrible conditions, and left her the money that she then gave away. Following the money It's hard to know how much money has been put into OneCoin. Documents leaked to the BBC say €4bn between August 2014 and March 2017. I've also been told by more than one person that it could be as much as €15bn. There's a famous saying in journalism, \"Follow the money.\" So with Georgia Catt, producer of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, I went to see Oliver Bullough, an expert on what he calls Moneyland - the shadowy parallel world where criminals and the super-rich hide their wealth. The problem, he explains, is that following the money isn't as easy as it sounds, because criminals structure their companies and bank accounts in such a way that their assets seem to disappear. \"They still exist\", he says, in his garden near the village of Hay-on-Wye. \"You can still use them to buy things, you can still use them to buy political influence and nice houses and yachts. But when it comes to someone trying to find them - whether that's a journalist or a police officer - they are invisible.\" It's no surprise, then, that OneCoin's corporate structure is incredibly complicated. Here's an example: Ruja bought a very large property in central Sofia. Technically it was owned by a company called One Property. One Property was owned by another company called Risk Ltd. Risk Ltd was owned by Ruja, but was then transferred to some unnamed Panamanians, but it was still managed by another company called Peragon. And Peragon was owned by another company called Artefix, which was owned by Ruja's mother, Veska. And then in 2017, the ownership of Artefix was sold to an unknown man in his 20s. Oliver describes this kind of dizzying arrangement as \"improbably standard\". For several months, a French journalist called Maxime Grimbert tried to unpick OneCoin's corporate workings, collecting as many company names and bank account details as he could. I show his results to Bullough, who immediately notices how many British companies there are. \"British companies are the companies of choice,\" he comments. \"They're very easy to set up and they look legitimate.\" He takes the first one on the list and looks it up on the Companies House website. Everything is meant to be transparent - the website contains the details of every company in the UK. It's thought to be a key anti-corruption tool. \"We are very proud of this in this country,\" he says. \"The problem is that when you create this company, no-one checks any of the information provided.\" He clicks to see the company's filing history, but where you should see company accounts, there is nothing. \"This is classic,\" he exclaims. \"Look, nothing has happened. They have filed no financial information at all.\" Then he tries checking the company's owners. The UK began to insist recently that companies must enter the name of the person with \"significant control\" - the real owner. \"This is supposed to mean that you can no longer use a British company to hide behind,\" he says, as he scrolls down the page. \"Oh, hey presto, they haven't filed a person with significant control. That's illegal… That is an anonymous shell company, as anonymous as anything that you can buy anywhere in the Seychelles or Nevis or the Marshall Islands or Vanuatu.\" So much for following the money. In an interconnected global economy, assets can simply vanish, and you end up chasing shadows. Find out more Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, with Jamie Bartlett and producer Georgia Catt, on BBC Sounds When you're dealing with a scam worth billions of euros, it's not unusual for shadowy groups to get involved. Several of the people Georgia and I interviewed spoke darkly about mysterious people and connections they didn't want to name. \"When you talk about the amount of money that's been put into OneCoin of course there's people out there who are pissed off and would do anything to shut anyone like me up,\" says Bjorn Bjercke, the blockchain expert who discovered there was no blockchain, and started talking about it publicly. He tells me he's received death threats as a result of speaking out. \"If I knew what I would have to go through, I would have never blown the whistle. I would have just turned my back and walked away,\" he says. When I ask him who might be behind the threats, he won't elaborate. \"I can't discuss that. It starts to get very very very scary, very very very fast.\" According to Bjercke, Dr Ruja never expected OneCoin to grow so big. People involved at the early stages have told him it was never supposed to be a billion-dollar scam. She tried to close it down, he says, but the dark forces wouldn't let her. \"Once OneCoin was running above 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, something happened where she was unable to stop it,\" Bjercke says. \"I think she was so scared in the fall of 2017 that she decided to skip.\" Igor Alberts, the MLM seller, also talks about the involvement of \"very influential people\". When I ask for more details, he replies: \"No, I cannot tell that because I don't want to take that risk with our lives.\" It's not clear who Bjorn and Igor are talking about, or whether they are even talking about the same people, but the US Department of Justice claims to have evidence of a link between Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov - who took over the running of OneCoin when Ruja disappeared - and \"significant players in Eastern European organised crime\". Inside 'the family' On 6 March 2019 Konstantin Ignatov was at Los Angeles International airport, waiting to fly back to Bulgaria after some OneCoin meetings in the US. Just as he was boarding his flight home, he was pounced on by FBI agents, arrested ,and charged with fraud in connection with OneCoin. Around the same time, the US authorities charged Dr Ruja in absentia for wire fraud, security fraud and money laundering. Amazingly, even after this, OneCoin continued to function - and people continued to invest in it. When Georgia and I visited Sofia a month later, Dr Ruja's personal mansion appeared to be locked up and empty, but the OneCoin office gave every appearance of being a busy workplace. Why have so many people continued to believe in OneCoin, despite all the evidence? Investors often told us that what drew them in initially was the fear that they would miss out on the next big thing. They'd read, with envy, the stories of people striking gold with Bitcoin and thought OneCoin was a second chance. Many were struck by the personality and persuasiveness of the \"visionary\" Dr Ruja. Investors might not have understood the technology, but they could see her talking to huge audiences, or at the Economist conference. They were shown photographs of her numerous degrees, and copies of Forbes magazine with her portrait on the front cover. The degrees are genuine. The Forbes cover isn't: it was actually an inside cover - a paid-for advertisement - from Forbes Bulgaria, but once the real cover was ripped off, it looked impressive. But it seems it's not just the promise of riches that keeps people believing. After Jen McAdam invested into OneCoin she was constantly told she was part of the OneCoin \"family\". She was entered into a Whatsapp group, with its own \"leader\" who disseminated information from the headquarters in Sofia. And McAdam's leader prepared her carefully for conversations with OneCoin sceptics. \"You're told not to believe anything from the 'outside world',\" she recalls. \"That's what they call it. 'Haters' - Bitcoiners are 'haters'. Even Google - 'Don't listen to Google!'\" Any criticism or awkward questions were actively discouraged. \"If you have any negativity you should not be in this group,\" she was told. Prof Eileen Barker of the London School of Economics, who has spent years studying groups like the Moonies and Scientologists, says there are similarities between OneCoin and messianic millennium cults, where people believe they are part of something big that is going to change the world - and no matter what the evidence, once they've signed up, it's very hard for them to admit they are wrong. \"When prophecy fails they believe more strongly,\" she says. \"Particularly if you have invested something, not only money, but belief, reputation, intelligence. You think, 'Wait a bit longer.'\" Money might push people to invest in the first place, but the sense of belonging, of doing something, of achieving something, is why they stay, Barker says. \"And in that sense it's cultic.\" In an ideal world, regulators would take action to protect consumers from scams like OneCoin. But the authorities all over the world have been slow to react, partly because the whole area of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is responsible for regulating financial markets in the UK, issued a warning on its website only in September 2016. \"We believe consumers should be wary of dealing with OneCoin,\" it said. \"We are concerned about the potential risk this poses to UK consumers.\" Less than a year later, the warning was removed from the website. The FCA said it had been up for long enough, but OneCoin promoters presented this as proof that the UK authorities considered OneCoin a legitimate investment. \"There's the answer, right from the horse's mouth, it's official,\" said one promoter from Alberta, Canada, in a video posted online. \"If they still thought we were a fraudulent company, then guess what, that warning's not removed. Game over.\" Several OneCoin events took place in the UK after the FCA took down the warning, and money continued to be invested. The FCA did not respond to the BBC's request to comment. The fact that OneCoin was operating internationally also created difficulties for the authorities. In August this year, the City of London police ended a two-year investigation into OneCoin. \"The companies and individuals behind OneCoin are based outside UK jurisdiction,\" it said. \"We've been unable to identify UK-based assets, which could be used to compensate UK investors.\" Such explanations don't offer much comfort to those affected. \"I'm devastated for all the UK victims,\" Jen McAdam told me, when she heard the news. She now runs Whatsapp support groups for OneCoin investors who realise they have been swindled. \"Where's the support? Where's the help? More folk are going to promote this. It's a green light for the OneCoin scammers to continue and extort more money from innocent people in the UK and nothing has been done about it. They don't care!\" The City of London Police told the BBC: \"There was insufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings against individuals based in the UK, though the force has never specified that there had been no concerns surrounding OneCoin. The force has provided assistance to foreign law enforcement partners in respect of their investigations concerning OneCoin personnel and will continue to do this. If you believe you have been a victim of fraud in relation to OneCoin or you suspect someone of actively marketing OneCoin, please come forward and report it to Action Fraud online.\" Until this week, however, the OneCoin head office remained open for business - and people were continuing to promote the currency. A Ugandan tragedy In the Ntangamo region of Uganda, not far from Rwandan border, most people make their living growing bananas, or sometimes cassava, sweet potato, beans or groundnut. In 2016 it was here that 22-year-old Daniel Lienhardt came as he was scraping together the 700,000 Ugandan shillings ($250) he needed to buy a OneCoin starter package. He already had 400,000 shillings in savings, and to raise the rest he returned from the capital, Kampala, to his family home, took three goats raised by his younger brothers, and sold them. \"There was no other way,\" he says ruefully. Daniel is one of thousands of Ugandans who've bought into Dr Ruja's fake cryptocurrency - and the OneCoin financial documents leaked to the BBC reveal that as time went on, investors like him became increasingly important to OneCoin. In Europe, less money was invested in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. But in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, it was the other way round. As the money started drying up in Europe, promoters turned more and more to countries like Uganda. Daniel took me and Georgia to meet Prudence, who first introduced him to OneCoin. They are still friends, even though both now realise it's a scam. Prudence is a nurse in a Kampala slum, who thought she could make more money selling OneCoin and set about recruiting new investors. A senior promoter gave her a nice car to impress customers, and instructed her to visit farmers when their crops were being harvested and they had money in their pocket. People in villages trust people from the city, Prudence tells us. To buy the packages some sold their cattle, their land and even their houses - with disastrous consequences. \"Some of their kids are at home sitting without going to school - some don't have anywhere to sleep. Some are running because they got loans from a bank. Some are hiding. Some are divorced.\" If anyone asks Prudence when the investment is going to deliver the promised riches, she tells them to wait. She can't bring herself to tell them the truth. \"I'm somehow hiding myself. I don't want those people I introduced into OneCoin to see me moving around. They can easily kill me. They thought I ate their money.\" But though she has stopped recruiting, many others haven't, and there are still plenty of interested buyers, she says. One of the main OneCoin offices in Kampala is attached to a church. There are videos of the minister, known as Bishop Fred, leading the congregation in call and response. \"One Life!\" he shouts. \"One Coin!\" the congregations replies. Bishop Fred, we learned, is now one of the country's top promoters of OneCoin, though he says it's no longer promoted during church services. As in other countries, OneCoin has spread here through networks of friends and families. Together with Daniel, Georgia and I travel south to meet his mother. She lives in a concrete house with a tin roof - five small rooms, a small television and a cooking area. A towel covers the front door, and a few metres away is her land, where she grows her own food and sells anything left over at the local market. The family had saved about £3,000 to buy a maize store so that Daniel's mother could stop spending every day in the fields. But when Daniel found out about OneCoin, it suddenly seemed like a much better alternative. His mother had doubts, but he persuaded her to put the money into OneCoin instead. She had no computer or smartphone, to do her own research. She doesn't speak English either, so I'm shocked to discover, as we sit and talk, that Daniel has never actually told his mother that the money is lost. \"I've never told her directly that it's not going to work - that there is no more money, there's no more hope,\" he tells me. \"I've been telling her it's changing. They keep postponing this. That I don't know what they're thinking. Maybe it's just a delay. I haven't given her 100% full confirmation that it won't work.\" I ask him why not. \"It's hard. It's hard to say.\" Daniel's mother then tells us that when she first saw me and Georgia, she assumed it was a good sign - that perhaps it meant that her money was going to arrive at last. She asks what news we have about OneCoin. Will she get her money back? I look at Daniel. \"Maybe you can tell her… Maybe…\" he says. He doesn't seem certain it's a good idea. Perhaps it would put him in an uncomfortable position. I don't want to be the person that breaks the news to Daniel's mother. Georgia suggests we tell Daniel's mother that we are journalists, and that we are investigating OneCoin because a lot of people aren't getting their money. Daniel translates, and his mother's reply comes back. \"If you have your money and it's taken away from you, life becomes stressful,\" she says. \"You've been planning, planning for something. If it doesn't happen, life is hard.\" Where are you, Dr Ruja? When we started planning the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast in late 2018, no-one really had a clue what happened to Dr Ruja after her disappearance. It was only earlier this year that the US authorities revealed she'd flown to Athens on 25 October 2017. And even then, the question remained, where had she gone next? There were rumours of course - lots of them. Igor Alberts, the MLM kingpin, said he'd heard she has Russian and Ukrainian passports and travels back and forth between Russia and Dubai. It's also been suggested that there are powerful people who might protect her in her native Bulgaria - and that she could hide in plain sight because of plastic surgery that makes her unrecognisable. I've even heard that she might be in London. Others told us she was dead - which does remain a possibility. This is clearly a question for a professional, which is why Georgia and I went to see private investigator Alan McLean. Finding people is his speciality, and there is one thing above all he says we should focus on. \"What was her lifestyle? That's the most important thing of all,\" he says. \"Go back to her life before OneCoin. Find out who her friends were, what her lifestyle was like, her family.\" Another tip he gives us is to find out where she has been on her yacht. We should try to get the tracker off it, he says, and he doesn't appear to be joking. I explain that this is probably beyond my abilities (apart from being illegal). Then he says I should check what yachts were bought in Athens around the time she arrived there from Sofia. \"In my opinion, for what it's worth, she's moving around the Mediterranean,\" he says. A few weeks after our meeting Alan gets back in touch, with some amazing information. His colleagues - also private investigators - visited top-end restaurants in Athens armed with photos of Ruja, and in one of them several waiters claimed to clearly remember her dining there earlier this year. When Georgia and I called them ourselves to check, they confirmed it. So it seems Ruja is still alive, and is able to visit a European capital without fearing arrest. Another lead comes our way when we pay a visit to a bizarre OneCoin beauty pageant in Bucharest. It's as glitzy as you would expect. Men are drinking champagne from the bottle, everyone is eyeing us in a way that makes us feel very uncomfortable. We soak up the atmosphere, cheer the British contestant, and then leave. But later we hear that we might have been in the presence of Dr Ruja - that she was there, in the same room, right in front of our noses. Except now with plastic surgery, and so harder to spot. From either Greece or Romania Dr Ruja could be extradited to the US. If it's true she was in these countries earlier this year, she probably has a fake identity. Taking seriously Alan McLean's advice about studying Dr Ruja's life before OneCoin, Georgia and I turn to the internet, which fortunately never forgets anything. Even the most obscure entry or innocuous comment on a forum is usually saved somewhere, and with enough digging can be found. You've heard of Google, but there are several other search engines that specialise in this. So we start unearthing previous addresses, known friends, old phone numbers, anything that could help us. We already knew that Dr Ruja spent some of her childhood in Schramberg, southern Germany. We had also visited the town of Waltenhofen in Bavaria, not far away, where she and her father bought a steelworks around a decade ago, an episode that led to her being tried for fraud. (She received a fine and a suspended sentence in October 2016.) While in Waltenhofen, we learned that she had a German husband, a lawyer for the well-known firm, Linklaters. But we were still surprised when, during our internet searches, Frankfurt started appearing over and over again. It wasn't a place we'd previously thought of looking. There were several old addresses in the Frankfurt area - ones she'd posted in forums many years ago, or were associated somehow with old phone numbers of hers. Then we started looking at some old photos of Ruja, and spotted one friend who appeared with her all the way back to 2011. And that friend was visiting the richest neighbourhood in Frankfurt in summer this year. From a tiny fragment of a poster advertising a tennis tournament, an expert identified the park in which one photograph was taken. We also learned that Dr Ruja had a daughter in late 2016, and that she remained very close to her. The daughter, we were informed, might be in Frankfurt. This is also where Dr Ruja's husband - or perhaps ex-husband - lives and works. Armed with a microphone and several photographs of Dr Ruja, we headed off to Frankfurt and searched old addresses and gated neighbourhoods said to be the most expensive in Germany. A couple of people looked at the photographs and paused for a long time, raising our hopes - but then said they didn't recognise her. A postman thought he recognised the name, but couldn't be sure. We called the lawyer who is (or was) married to her, and he didn't want to talk. Did we get close to her? Could she really be hiding out in the heart of the EU? We don't know. Frankfurt probably isn't the only place she goes - it might be one of several places, including perhaps Dubai and Russia. Then a few days later we received a call from a trusted source we cannot identify. He told us we were right - Frankfurt is indeed where she spends much of her time. But we need to keep going, we needed to find the house. \"You will find her,\" he said. \"You must dig deeper.\" She would have known that we were looking for her, he added, and she would have laughed at us. On 5 November 2019, the day after the final episode of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast was released, Dr Ruja's brother, Konstantin Ignatov, appeared in court in New York, testifying for the government in a case against a lawyer accused of laundering $400m of the money OneCoin made in the US. In court it was revealed that Ignatov signed a plea deal on 4 October, in which he pleaded guilty to several fraud charges. A court reporter was there to hear his testimony, and according to his account of the proceedings Ignatov appears to have implied that his sister had duped him with the same line the organisation put out to its investors - that OneCoin critics were \"haters\" who could not be believed. She vanished, he said, because she was afraid that somebody close to her was going to give her up to the FBI. She had got hold of a \"big passport\", he said, and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, then Athens. OneCoin has always denied wrongdoing. It told the BBC: \"OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a crypto-currency.\" It said the Missing Cryptoqueen podcast \"will not present any truthful information and cannot be considered objective, nor unbiased\". It added that the allegations made about it around the world were being challenged, stating: \"Our partners, our customers and our lawyers are fighting successfully against this action around the globe and we are sure that the vision of a new system on the basis of a 'financial revolution' will be established.\" OneCoin was a familiar scam with a digital twist - a new and hugely successful take on the old pyramid scheme. But to me it symbolises something else too. It represents the dark side of rapid technological change - the way that every new technology creates amazing new opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don't. Dr Ruja identified several of society's weak spots and exploited them. She knew there would be enough people either desperate enough, or greedy enough, or confused enough to take a bet on OneCoin. She understood that truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart when there is so much contradictory information online. She spotted that society's defence against OneCoin - the law-makers, the police, and also us in the media would struggle to understand what was happening. And, most frustratingly of all, she correctly guessed that by the time we realised it, she'd be gone, along with the money.", "summary": "2017年10月，加密数码币圈出了件大事：维卡币（OneCoin）全球吸金40亿欧元，然后美女“庄主”，号称“加密币女王”的茹雅·伊戈纳托娃（Ruja Ignatova）连同这笔巨款失踪了。BBC记者杰米·巴特列特（Jamie Bartlett）和乔琪亚·凯特（Georgia Catt）制作的播客节目 《失踪的加密币女王》（The Missing Cryptoqueen） ，循蛛丝马迹探求真相。"}

Mr Duterte said he accepted the mandate with \"extreme humility\". The 71-year-old stirred controversy during campaigning with his incendiary comments. He has credited his success to his tough stance on law and order. His record as the crime-crushing mayor of the southern town of Davao, once notorious for its lawlessness, earned him the moniker The Punisher and resonated with voters. \"Duterte Harry\" in quotes The Philippines elects its first transgender politician Populism, celebrity and ugly realities in the Philippines Who were the candidates in the Philippines' elections? Other driving issues of the election campaign were pervasive corruption, as well as the poverty and inequality experienced by many Filipinos despite economic growth under outgoing President Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino. What next for Duterte: Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, Manila Rodrigo Duterte, a man dubbed by his rivals as an executioner who would bring terror to the Philippines, has won the presidency by a clear margin, polling nearly twice as many votes as his nearest rivals. But what is less clear is what he will do with the job. His blunt promise to sweep away criminals and corrupt officials won him the backing of millions of Filipinos weary of ineffective governments. But he has so far offered few policy details. A spokesman has already pledged a radical overhaul of the political system. Human rights groups have warned he may repeat what happened in the southern city of Davao, where as mayor he is accused of allowing death squads to murder hundreds of alleged criminals. Mr Duterte has a formidable task in a country still hampered by poverty and poor infrastructure - just meeting the lofty expectations he raised during his campaign will be hard enough. Election officials have said there was a record turnout at polling stations, with more than 81% of the 54 million registered voters casting a ballot. Senators and about 18,000 local officials including mayors are also being elected. The PPCRV (Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting) poll monitor said that with 90% of the presidential ballots counted, Mr Duterte had more than 14.8m votes - about 39%. The PPCRV is accredited by the election commission to monitor counting but its reporting does not represent an official tally. Mr Roxas, a former interior minister and Mr Duterte's closest rival, had 8.6 million votes. As the extent of his lead became clear, Mr Duterte told AFP news agency: \"It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people.\" Mr Roxas accepted his rival's win. \"There are many tears in the room. Let me tell you this is not a time for tears. For our country, we have had a peaceful, successful transfer of power.\" Another key rival, Senator Grace Poe, was the first to concede defeat, promising to \"co-operate with the healing process\" after a turbulent campaign. In the election to be vice-president, Leni Robredo, a social activist, is currently slightly ahead of Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, the son of a former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The appeal of Duterte: Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent The statistics are stark, and bleak. Experts say anywhere between 40% and 80% of Philippine legislators are connected to political dynasties with vested interests. A handful of the families control almost all of the country's wealth. And perhaps the bleakest statistic of all: 25% of the population lives under the poverty line - a figure that has not changed much in two decades. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then that Filipinos have chosen Mr Duterte's crime-busting, tough-talking, action-oriented ways over the current administration's candidate Manuel Roxas. More on this from Karishma Mr Aquino is standing down as the constitution limits presidents to one six-year term. As Mr Duterte rose in opinion polls ahead of voting, Mr Aquino had tried to unite other candidates against him, warning his election could mean a return to dictatorship for the Philippines. Mr Duterte has made many controversial statements during his campaign, saying that he would massacre criminals and drug-users, joking about the rape of an Australian missionary and saying he would dissolve congress if it didn't agree with him. He has also given forthright opinions on the Philippines' territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, saying he would sail to disputed islands and plant the Philippine flag there. The Philippines has taken one of its claims to a court of arbitration at the Hague. On Monday, he said he would seek multilateral talks over the issue, to include the US and Japan.

He added that it showed \"recognition that a new kind of entrepreneurship and leadership, fashioned in the age of the new technology, is needed to lead not just The Post, but perhaps the news business itself\". \"Jeff Bezos seems to me exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism on the scale many of us have been hoping for, while employing all the applicable tools and best sensibilities of a new era and the old,\" he said. The Post has been \"declining in circulation especially among young readers,\" Horizon Media analyst Brad Adgate told the BBC. Nonetheless, he added: \"I always thought this would be a newspaper that would be able to withstand the digital tide because of the name and the prestige. It is, next to the New York Times, the most prestigious paper in the country.\" According to the Alliance for Audited Media, a newspaper auditing firm, the Washington Post was the seventh most popular daily newspaper in the US this year, with a total circulation of 474,767 - a 6.5% decline on last year. In an open letter posted on the Washington Post's website, Mr Bezos said he would not be leading the paper on a day-to-day basis and sought to reassure nervous employees, but saying he would not seek to change \"the values\" of the paper. However, he added: \"There will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years...The internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs.\" Mr Bezos said he did not have a plan yet for what exactly he thought those changes would be. Faded glory The sale took many by surprise. \"We've all been broadsided by the acquisition. There are few things that come as a surprise any more but this one did,\" said Rebecca Lieb, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. \"However, when you really start thinking about it, it makes sense - all because of digital,\" she said, citing Mr Bezos's experience with digital delivery and personalisation at Amazon. In a filing with regulators, the company said, however, that Mr Bezos was not purchasing its other notable online properties: Slate magazine, TheRoot.com, and Foreign Policy. This is the second sale of a major US newspaper in as many days. Over the weekend, the New York Times announced it had sold another iconic newspaper, the Boston Globe, to John W. Henry, the owner of the baseball team the Boston Red Sox, for $70m - a fraction of the $1.1bn the company had paid for the paper in 1993.", "summary": "电子商网巨头亚马逊的总裁贝索斯同意以2.5亿美元的价格收购著名美国报纸《华盛顿邮报》。"}

China bought it from Ukraine in 1998 and has spent 10 years refitting it. It is seen as a potent symbol of China's ambition to modernise its navy, amid a strategic shift in the region. The fact that the US secretary of defence was allowed to step on board the carrier will be seen as a sign that the two countries may be willing to engage in more military co-operation, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Washington has repeatedly called for more transparency from Beijing on its military spending, our correspondent adds. Sea trials US officials said that the defence chief's visit to the Liaoning at Yuchi naval base - which took place after a US request - lasted about two hours. No further details were immediately available and journalists accompanying him on the China visit did not go with him. The carrier was built in the 1980s for the Soviet navy but was never completed. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the rusting hull - then called the Varyag - sat in dockyards in Ukraine. A Chinese company with links to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) then bought the Varyag, saying it wanted to turn the vessel into a floating casino in Macau. In 2001 the ship was towed to China. The Chinese military confirmed in June 2011 that it was being refitted to serve as the nation's first aircraft carrier. Earlier this year, it completed sea trials in the South China Sea, where China has overlapping territorial claims with several South East Asian nations. Beijing's more assertive stance on this issue in recent years has led to a rise in tensions between China and its neighbours, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines. China is also embroiled in a separate dispute over East China Sea islands that are controlled by Japan. In Tokyo, Mr Hagel addressed regional territorial disputes, saying Chinese authorities should have \"respect for their neighbours\". \"You cannot... redefine boundaries and violate territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations by force, coercion and intimidation, whether it's in small islands in the Pacific or large nations in Europe,\" he said. The Liaoning aircraft carrier has already attracted controversy. Late last year, Mr Hagel criticised China as \"irresponsible\" after the near-collision of a US warship and a Chinese naval vessel in the South China Sea. The US said its guided missile cruiser, USS Cowpens, was operating in international waters on 5 December when the Chinese vessel - which was accompanying the Liaoning - forced it to take evasive action. State-run newspaper Global Times, however, quoted an expert as saying that the US boat had been \"harassing\" the Liaoning as it carried out drills.", "summary": "美国国防部长哈格尔周一（7日）在访问中国的第一天登上了中国唯一的一艘航空母舰辽宁号参观。"}

Beijing is alleged to have forced many Uighur women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices, apparently to control population growth. China has denied the allegations. The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim minority group which lives mainly in Xinjiang province in northwestern China. The tweet, published on Thursday, also claimed that Uighur women were \"more confident and independent\" as a result of \"reproductive health\" being \"promoted\" to them. Over the weekend, the tweet was replaced with a message from the social media site which claimed the tweet \"violated\" Twitter's rules, without providing further details. The original tweet had linked to an article by China Daily, a state-run newspaper, which alleged the eradication of extremism in Xinjiang \"had given Uighur women more autonomy when deciding whether to have children\". The article referenced a report by the Xinjiang Development Research Centre which said: \"The changes were not caused by 'forced sterilisation' of the Uyghur population, as repeatedly claimed by some western scholars and politicians.\" Last year, a report by China scholar Adrian Zenz alleged Uighur and other ethnic minority women were being threatened with internment in camps for refusing to abort pregnancies that exceeded birth quotas. The findings were based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women in Xinjiang. The report also said that Uighur women with more than the legally permitted number of children - but also many women who had not exceeded birth quotas - were involuntarily fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs), while others were coerced into receiving sterilisation surgery. Under current rules, couples in China are allowed to have up to two children, with couples in some rural areas allowed up to three. Former detainees in internment camps, which China says are re-education camps to tackle extremism, said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs. According to Mr Zenz's analysis of the data, natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically in recent years, with growth rates falling by 84% in the two largest Uighur prefectures between 2015 and 2018 and declining further in 2019. Following the release of that report, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on \"all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanising practices\".

Publisher Andreas Wirsching said \"the figures overwhelmed us\". He is director of the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich. But the sales are well below those of best-sellers in Germany. It is an academic edition, costing €58 (£49). At the end of January the IfZ will launch a sixth print run. The book contains critical notes by scholars. Unlike the Nazi-era editions, the IfZ's Mein Kampf (My Struggle) has a plain white cover - without a picture of Hitler. The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany. Mr Wirsching told the German news agency DPA that the IfZ was planning a shorter, French-language edition. \"But two-thirds of our commentaries will be translated\" for it, he said. The first print run in Germany in 2016 was 4,000 copies. Life of Adolf Hitler Austria MPs vote to seize Hitler's house Himmler diaries show daily Nazi horrors Living with a Nazi name The decision to republish the inflammatory book was criticised by Jewish groups. Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power. It sets out racist ideas that the Nazis put into practice later, including the denigration and oppression of Jews and Slavs. 'Not a runaway hit' - the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin writes: The fact that the Nazi manifesto reached number one in Der Spiegel's non-fiction charts in April is cited as evidence that Adolf Hitler's propaganda is making a comeback in Germany. But the term \"best-seller\" does not necessarily mean very much. A quarter of all books sold in Germany are bought in the run-up to Christmas. At other times of the year it is possible to top listings with relatively few sales. Mein Kampf (My Struggle) is an expensive academic text, and is being bought by libraries, schools and history academics. For a German non-fiction book sales of 85,000 are not bad. But the figures don't indicate a runaway hit. The current biggest non-fiction seller is The Hidden Life of Trees, a book about the ecosystem of woodland, which has sold half a million copies so far. Read Damien's analysis in full here. After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the state of Bavaria. Under German law copyright lasts for 70 years. While the Bavarian regional government held the copyright, reprinting of the book was banned. But the copyright expired a year ago. Mr Wirsching said he favoured \"clever\" teachers using the IfZ edition in the classroom. He warned against \"repeating the absurd 1950s discussion, when people said 'it was all Hitler's fault'.\" He said the IfZ had obtained solid legal advice before republishing the book on a limited scale. And the scholarly edition was aimed partly at pre-empting any editions put out by Nazi sympathisers. \"It would be irresponsible to just let this text spread arbitrarily,\" he told DPA.", "summary": "特别注释版的阿道夫·希特勒《我的奋斗》的德国出版商透露，《我的奋斗》自一年前上市以来，销量数量激增。"}

One had links to North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The information comes from the leak of 11m of the company's internal files. Mossack Fonseca registers companies as offshore entities operated under its own name. This meant the identities of the real owners were hard to trace because they were kept out of public documents. Live: Panama Papers reaction All you need to know about the Panama Papers Some of the businesses were registered before international sanctions were imposed. But in several cases Mossack Fonseca continued to act as a proxy for them after they were blacklisted. DCB Finance was established in 2006, with its owners and directors based in North Korea's capital Pyongyang. It was later put under sanctions by the US Treasury for raising funds for the North Korean regime and being linked to a bank helping to fund the regime's nuclear weapons programme. The leaked files reveal the owners of DCB Finance were a North Korean official, Kim Chol Sam and Nigel Cowie, a British banker who was also CEO of the sanctioned Daedong Credit Bank. Mossack Fonseca appears to have overlooked that the owners and directors of the company were based in Pyongyang until it was contacted by the British Virgin Islands (BVI) authorities in 2010, inquiring about another company Mossack Fonseca had set up with directors in North Korea. Mossack Fonseca resigned as agents for DCB Finance in September 2010. Panama Papers - read more from BBC News In 2013 the BVI authorities contacted Mossack Fonseca again, asking what checks they had carried out before opening DCB Finance in 2006. An email from Mossack Fonseca's compliance department on 9 August 2013 says: \"We have not yet addressed the reason we maintained a relationship with DCB Finance when we knew or ought to have known from incorporation in 2006, that the country, North Korea was on the black list.\" It adds: \"We should have identified from the onset that this was a high risk company.\" Mr Cowie was not placed under sanctions. He has said that DCB Finance was established for legitimate business purposes and that he was \"unaware, whether directly or indirectly, of any transactions being made with any sanctioned organisation or for any sanctioned purpose, during my entire tenure\". Assad's cousin Another case involves Rami Makhlouf, who is the cousin of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and has reported wealth of $5bn. In 2008 the US Treasury imposed sanctions on him because it deemed him to be a \"regime insider\" and someone who \"manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals\". Mossack Fonseca continued to front six businesses - including one company called Drex Technologies - for Mr Makhlouf after the restrictions were put in place. The files also show the Swiss branch of HSBC provided financial services for the firm. In 2010, two years after the sanctions were imposed, HSBC wrote to Mossack Fonseca saying it believed Drex Technologies was a company of \"good standing\". An internal email from Mossack Fonseca's compliance department also suggests HSBC staff dealing with Drex Technologies knew who Rami Makhlouf was. The email, dated 17 February 2011, says: \"We have contacted HSBC who stated that they are very aware of the fact that Mr Makhlouf is the cousin of the President of Syria. \"The HSBC compliance department of the bank not only in Geneva but also in their headquarters in London know about Mr Makhlouf and confirm that they are comfortable with him.\" HSBC said: \"We work closely with the authorities to fight financial crime and implement sanctions. Our policy is clear that offshore accounts can only remain open either where clients have been thoroughly vetted where authorities ask us to maintain an account for the purposes of monitoring activity, or where an account has been frozen based on sanctions obligations.\" War fuel Mossack Fonseca cut all its links with Rami Makhlouf in September 2011, nine months after it was first recommended. But the leaked documents reveal the firm also provided business services to another company that was registered on a US sanctions list in 2014. The company is called Pangates International Corporation Limited. The US Treasury Department believes it supplied aviation fuel to the Syrian government to fly military aircraft during the current civil war. The files show Mossack Fonseca first incorporated the petroleum firm in 1999. Nine months after the sanctions came into effect, it was still handling the paperwork for Pangates International Corporation and certified it was a company in the Seychelles of good standing. It was not until August 2015 that Mossack Fonseca acknowledged the company was on a blacklist and reported it to financial regulators in the Seychelles. Mossack Fonseca said: \"We have never knowingly allowed the use of our companies by individuals having any relationship with North Korea or Syria. We have our own procedures in place to identify such individuals, to the extent it is reasonably possible.\" Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela told the BBC his country was willing to contribute to any investigation in any country relating to the documents. \"We are an open country,\" he said.

In the evening the pair returned to the Palace for a dinner and dance, expected to continue into the early hours. The couple will now be known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Police estimate a million people lined the procession route from the abbey to the palace following the wedding. Prince William later drove his new bride back to Clarence House, following a buffet reception at Buckingham Palace, at the wheel of his father's classic blue Aston Martin, before returning to the palace in the evening. The vehicle was decked in ribbons and balloons with \"Just Wed\" on the number plate. The church service, watched by 1,900 guests, ran smoothly but the prince did struggle to place the wedding ring on the duchess's finger. Following a long tradition, the ring has been fashioned from Welsh gold given to Prince William by the Queen. After the couple said their vows - in which the bride did not promise to obey her husband - the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams, declared: \"I pronounce that they be man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\" They spent a private moment together with their families, as they signed the marriage register. Prince William has been given the title of the Duke of Cambridge by the Queen, and Miss Middleton has become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge on their marriage. The duchess, who managed to keep her wedding dress a secret, wore an ivory and lace gown by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen. The prince wore the red tunic of an Irish Guards colonel - his most senior honorary appointment. Among the guests at Westminster Abbey were singer-songwriter Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish, former England rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, and former England football captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria. Actor Rowan Atkinson, a close friend of Prince Charles, Prince Harry's friend Chelsy Davy and film director Guy Ritchie were also there. UK Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and former British PM Sir John Major were among the politicians present. For those lining the route, large speakers broadcast the wedding service, and hundreds of millions of people were estimated to watch the proceedings worldwide on television. Royal officials said the couple were involved in planning their wedding day, from the music at the ceremony to the flowers and the cake. Inside Westminster Abbey, an avenue of trees lined the red carpet leading up to the altar. The bride walked up the aisle to coronation anthem I Was Glad, by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, from Psalm 122. Her brother James Middleton gave the Lesson, reading Romans 12: 1-2, 9-18. Classical compositions by Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams featured during the ceremony, alongside the hymn Jerusalem and the English melody Greensleeves. A canape reception was held for 650 guests at Buckingham Palace in the afternoon. Later, about 300 close friends and relatives were invited to a dinner and disco, hosted by Prince Charles. The couple changed outfits for the event - Prince William was in black tie while his bride wore a strapless white satin gazar evening gown with diamante embroidered detail round the waist, by the same designer, Sarah Burton. But the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh left for a weekend away after hosting the lunchtime reception. They will miss Prince Harry's best man speech and Michael Middleton's father of the bride address. Despite predictions of showers, the weather stayed dry for the royal couple.

In addition, a state-run newspaper has reported that a Chinese regulator has decided the company's patents have given it a monopoly position. That could lead to a huge fine. Qualcomm has been under investigation by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) over claims that it had overcharged for the right to use its standard-essential patents and had abused its market position. Standard-essential patents refer to innovations that are critical to a specification adopted as an industry-shared technology. Qualcomm owns many inventions that lie at the heart of 3G, 4G and other wireless data technologies. As a result, device manufacturers must pay it a fee to ensure their products can communicate with others devices even if they do not include any of the various chips that Qualcomm manufactures itself. Potential penalty The NDRC said in February that one of the complaints it was looking into was a claim that Qualcomm was charging higher prices in China than elsewhere. If it finds the company guilty, it can fine it up to 10% of its local revenue for the past financial year. Nearly half of Qualcomm's sales came from China last year, meaning its penalty could total $1.2bn (£723m).

However, the NDRC would first have to rule the company had abused its position to impose a penalty - simply having a monopoly is not prohibited in China. \"We have met with and are continuing to fully co-operate with the NDRC, as it conducts its investigation, but the timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the impact on our future business in China,\" Qualcomm's president, Derek Aberle, said during a conference call following the firm's latest earnings release on Wednesday. He added that his firm expected it would have to make some kind of payment, but was not able to estimate its size at this time. Misreported sales While the probe continues, Qualcomm revealed that it was experiencing problems obtaining the fees it believed were due. Mr Aberle told bank analysts that he believed some of the company's Chinese licensees were under-reporting the number of 3G and 4G devices they had made for local and international sale, and had ordered its own investigation as a consequence. \"We believe we will find that they are only reporting something less than 100% of their sales, and hoping they are going to be able to get away with it,\" he explained. Although the firm reported net income of $2.24bn for its past quarter - a 42% rise on the previous year - and higher sales than Wall Street had forecast, its shares still fell as a consequence of the revelations. Its stock dropped more than 7% after the Nasdaq opened. Start-up cash Perhaps in a bid to build up goodwill, Qualcomm also announced a pledge to invest up to a further $150m in Chinese start-ups alongside its results. It also noted that it had recently taken stakes in a local education software firm, Cambridge Wowo, and a health app maker, Bohee. The firm's previous investments include a stake in China's hugely popular smartphone maker Xiaomi, which uses its processor chips.", "summary": "总部在美国加州的著名电子芯片技术公司高通（Qualcomm）目前在中国的业务从各方受挫，导致公司股票下滑。"}

Colorado, along with Washington state, voted to legalise the use and possession of cannabis for people over the age of 21 in November 2012. Washington is not expected to allow the sale of it until later in 2014. Colorado and Washington are among 20 states to have approved marijuana use for medical purposes. The drug is still illegal under federal law. 'Who knows?' Store owners had stocked up, prepared celebrations and hired extra security in preparation for their opening on Green Wednesday. Under the new law, cannabis will be sold like alcohol. Residents will be able to buy up to one ounce, while those from out of the state can purchase up to a quarter of an ounce. Cannabis can only be smoked on private premises, with the permission of the owners. The sale of the drug will be taxed in the same way as alcohol, and state officials have said they expected it to raise millions - the first $40m of which will be used for school construction, The Denver Post reports. It was not clear exactly how many shops were expected to open on New Year's Day, though around 30 were listed by The Denver Post. A total of 136 stores have been given licences to sell marijuana. Most of the shops are based in Denver. Some communities elsewhere in Colorado have exercised their right not to have the stores. Supporters of legalising cannabis have praised Colorado's move. Rachel Gillette, of the Colorado branch of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said the state \"has found an exit strategy for the failed drug war and I hope other states will follow our lead\". But critics say it sends the wrong message to the nation's youth and fear it will lead to serious public health and social problems. \"There will still need to be a black market to serve people who are ineligible to buy on a legal market, especially kids,\" said Kevin Sabet of Smart Approaches to Marijuana. \"It's almost the worst of both worlds.\"", "summary": "美国科罗拉多州今天（1月1日）成为美国有史以来第一个合法销售大麻的州。"}

The European Space Agency (ESA) is due to upload commands to tell Philae to deploy its drill. The hope is that it can pull up some samples to analyse in the robot's onboard laboratories. It is a high risk activity, however, because the torque could destabilise the delicately placed lander.

Friday night's radio contact with the orbiting Rosetta satellite will be the last that engineers have a reasonable confidence will work. The team is still not sure where on the surface the probe came to rest after bouncing upon landing on Wednesday. Scientists have been examining radio transmissions between the orbiter and the lander to see if they can triangulate a position. This work has now produced a \"circle of uncertainty\" within which Philae almost certainly lies. Follow-up imagery by Rosetta should now find the little craft, says Paolo Ferri, the head of mission operations at the European Space Agency. He said Friday's activities would be critical. \"We're coming to the end so we're taking more risks. But we're super happy with what we've done up until now.

The idea is that this could eke out some more life for the lander. Launched in 2004, the European Space Agency (Esa) mission hopes to learn about the origins of our Solar System. It has already sent back the first images ever taken from the crumbling, fractured terrain of a comet. Philae got to the icy 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on the back of Esa's Rosetta satellite after a 10-year, 6.4 billion-km (4bn-mile) journey, which reached its climax on Wednesday with a seven-hour drop to the surface.", "summary": "科学家表示，因为担心菲莱（Philae）上的电池在数个小时之内就会耗尽，因此现在是让菲莱冒险行动的最后时机。"}

There are many ways in which the iPhone has defined the modern economy. There is the sheer profitability of the thing, of course: there are only two or three companies in the world that make as much money as Apple does from the iPhone alone. Apple may not have sold the first smartphone, but the iPhone represented a quantum leap compared with earlier models, and its version became an object of desire for most of humanity. There's the way the iPhone transformed other markets - software, music, and advertising. But those are just the obvious facts about the iPhone. And when you delve more deeply, the tale is a surprising one. We give credit to Steve Jobs and other leading figures in Apple - his early partner Steve Wozniak, his successor Tim Cook, his visionary designer Sir Jony Ive - but some of the most important actors in this story have been forgotten. Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Ask yourself: what actually makes an iPhone an iPhone? It's partly the cool design, the user interface, the attention to detail in the way the software works and the hardware feels. But underneath the charming surface of the iPhone are some critical elements that made it, and all the other smartphones, possible. The economist Mariana Mazzucato has made a list of 12 key technologies that make smartphones work: 1) tiny microprocessors, 2) memory chips, 3) solid state hard drives, 4) liquid crystal displays and 5) lithium-based batteries. That's the hardware. Then there are the networks and the software. So 6) Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithms - clever bits of maths that make it possible to swiftly turn analogue signals such as sound, visible light and radio waves into digital signals that a computer can handle. At 7) - and you might have heard of this one - the internet. A smartphone isn't a smartphone without the internet. At 8) HTTP and HTML, the languages and protocols that turned the hard-to-use internet into the easy-to-access World Wide Web. 9) Cellular networks. Otherwise your smartphone not only isn't smart, it's not even a phone. 10) Global Positioning Systems or GPS. 11) The touchscreen. 12) Siri, the voice-activated artificial intelligence agent. All of these technologies are important components of what makes an iPhone, or any smartphone, actually work. Some of them are not just important, but indispensable. But when Mariana Mazzucato assembled this list of technologies, and reviewed their history, she found something striking. The foundational figure in the development of the iPhone wasn't Steve Jobs. It was Uncle Sam. Every single one of these 12 key technologies was supported in significant ways by governments - often the American government. A few of these cases are famous. Many people know, for example, that the World Wide Web owes its existence to the work of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was a software engineer employed at Cern, the particle physics research centre in Geneva that is funded by governments across Europe. And the internet itself started as Arpanet - an unprecedented network of computers funded by the US Department of Defense in the early 1960s. GPS, of course, was a pure military technology, developed during the Cold War and opened up to civilian use only in the 1980s. Other examples are less famous, though scarcely less important. The Fast-Fourier-Transform is a family of algorithms that have made it possible to move from a world where the telephone, the television and the gramophone worked on analogue signals, to a world where everything is digitised and can therefore be dealt with by computers such as the iPhone. The most common such algorithm was developed from a flash of insight from the great American mathematician John Tukey. What was Tukey working on at the time? You've guessed it: a military application. Specifically, he was on President Kennedy's Scientific Advisory committee in 1963, trying to figure out how to detect when the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons. Smartphones wouldn't be smartphones without their touchscreens - but the inventor of the touchscreen was an engineer named EA Johnson, whose initial research was carried out while Johnson was employed by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, a stuffily-named agency of the British government. The work was further developed at Cern - those guys again. Eventually multi-touch technology was commercialised by researchers at the University of Delaware in the United States - Wayne Westerman and John Elias, who sold their company to Apple itself. Yet even at that late stage in the game, governments played their part: Wayne Westerman's research fellowship was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the CIA. Then there's the girl with the silicon voice, Siri. Back in the year 2000, seven years before the first iPhone, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, commissioned the Stanford Research Institute to develop a kind of proto-Siri, a virtual office assistant that might help military personnel to do their jobs. Twenty universities were brought into the project, furiously working on all the different technologies necessary to make a voice-activated virtual assistant a reality. Seven years later, the research was commercialised as a start-up, Siri Incorporated- and it was only in 2010 that Apple stepped in to acquire the results for an undisclosed sum. As for hard drives, lithium-ion batteries, liquid crystal displays and semiconductors themselves - there are similar stories to be told. In each case, there was scientific brilliance and plenty of private sector entrepreneurship. But there were also wads of cash thrown at the problem by government agencies - usually US government agencies, and for that matter, usually some arm of the US military. Silicon Valley itself owes a great debt to Fairchild Semiconductor - the company that developed the first commercially practical integrated circuits. And Fairchild Semiconductor, in its early days, depended on military procurement. Of course, the US military didn't make the iPhone. Cern did not create Facebook or Google. These technologies, that so many people rely on today, were honed and commercialised by the private sector. But it was government funding and government risk-taking that made all these things possible. That's a thought to hold on to as we ponder the technological challenges ahead in fields such energy and biotechnology. Steve Jobs was a genius, there's no denying that. One of his remarkable side projects was the animation studio Pixar - which changed the world of film when it released the digitally animated film, Toy Story. Even without the touchscreen and the internet and the Fast-Fourier-Transform, Steve Jobs might well have created something wonderful. But it would not have been a world-shaking technology like the iPhone. More likely it would, like Woody and Buzz, have been an utterly charming toy.

China called the ruling \"ill-founded\" and says it will not be bound by it. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including reefs and islands also claimed by others. The tribunal in The Hague said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights. It also said China had caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands. The ruling came from an arbitration tribunal constituted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It ruled on seven of 15 points brought by the Philippines. Among the key findings were: The ruling is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers of enforcement. The dispute The Philippines has had diplomatic spats with China over the Scarborough Shoal and Spratlys in particular. It says China's \"nine-dash line\", which China uses to demarcate its territorial claims, is unlawful under the UNCLOS convention. Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have competing claims in the region. Although these islands are largely uninhabited, they may have reserves of natural resources around them. There has been little detailed exploration of the area, so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas. The sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region. Why is the South China Sea contentious? Rivalries underneath the South China Sea Reaction As expected, China is standing firm and re-asserting its claim to the area. \"China's territorial sovereignty and marine rights in the South China Sea will not be affected by the so-called Philippines South China Sea ruling in any way,\" said Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said China was \"determined to maintain peace and stability\" and was committed to resolving disputes \"through negotiations based on respects to historical facts and according to international laws\". China's state news agency Xinhua said that \"as the panel has no jurisdiction, its decision is naturally null and void\". But Philippe Sands, a lawyer for the Philippines in the case, said it was a \"clear and unanimous judgement that upholds the rule of law and the rights claimed by the Philippines\". The Philippine government says it is now studying the ruling. However, the BBC's Jonah Fisher, in Manila, says the lack of celebrations may be a result of the recent change of government. Our correspondent says many Filipinos believe newly elected President Rodrigo Duterte may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response. The US called the decision an \"important contribution to the shared goal of a peaceful resolution to disputes in the South China Sea\", and urged all parties to consider it \"final and legally binding\". Taiwan, which also claims the disputed area, said the ruling had \"seriously damaged\" its rights. \"We hereby solemnly state that we will definitely not accept this ruling,\" the foreign ministry said. The US sent an aircraft carrier and fighter jets to the region ahead of the decision, while the Chinese navy has been carrying out exercises near the disputed Paracel islands. Conciliatory tone - Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing This result represents a major loss of face for China, and yet the first response from Beijing to the tribunal's demolition of its claims seems be rather conciliatory. On the one hand, the Chinese government has re-stated that it has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the area and that the activities of its people there date back to over 2,000 years ago. However, it then goes on to talk about \"consultation with the states directly concerned\" and proposes \"joint development in relevant maritime areas\". Airlines and shipping companies will be pleased to hear that China has also restated that it respects \"freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all states under international law in the South China Sea\" and that it stands ready to ensure \"unimpeded access to international shipping lanes\". All this seems to point towards Beijing possibly seeking some sort of negotiated settlement rather than ramping up the pressure on the Philippines following Manila's comprehensive victory in The Hague.", "summary": "海牙法庭周二（12日）将对南海仲裁案作出裁决。该案由菲律宾单方面提起仲裁，菲律宾称中国在南海区域的活动违反了国际法。"}

It comes as a longstanding conflict between the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) and government troops escalates. The military is said to be pounding the rebels with airstrikes and artillery. As well as the thousands displaced, there are fears that many people remain trapped in conflict-stricken areas, near the border with China. Aid organisations have urged the government to allow them access. \"Our biggest concern is for the safety of civilians - including pregnant women, the elderly, small children and people with disabilities,\" Mark Cutts, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told AFP news agency. \"We must ensure that these people are protected.\" Who are the Kachin rebels? In addition to the Rohingya crisis in western Myanmar (also known as Burma), the country's north has seen clashes involving other ethnic minorities. The Kachin, who are mostly Christian, have fought for greater autonomy in this predominantly Buddhist nation since 1961. Across Kachin and northern Shan state, an estimated 120,000 people are displaced by the fighting. The Myanmar government has for the past six years pursued peace agreements with many other ethnic insurgent armies, says the BBC's South Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. But fighting with the relatively well-armed KIO has continued, and they remain one of the most powerful rebel groups. Why the surge in violence? Sporadic fighting has taken place since a ceasefire broke down between the KIO and the military in 2011. Rights groups say the army has stepped up its campaign while global attention focuses on the Rohingya crisis, which has seen some 700,000 people flee to Bangladesh. In a report last month, the UNHR highlighted a \"spike in human rights violations and abuses\", including extrajudicial killings, torture and sexual violence. What has the international response been? The country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised for failing to end human rights violations and restricting access to aid in Myanmar. The UN has called on the authorities to stop dismissing reports of abuses in Kachin. Meanwhile, the US embassy in Yangon said it was \"deeply concerned\" about intensified fighting in the region in a statement on Friday. \"We call upon the government, including the military, to protect civilian populations and allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to those affected by the conflicts,\" it said.", "summary": "缅甸北部克钦邦的武装份子与政府军冲突再爆发，数以千计的民族逃离该地区。"}

Once in control of a wi-fi access point, it leaves computers on the network extremely vulnerable. The team's lead researcher told the BBC it was working on software to prevent such attacks being possible. \"Rather than rely on people to use strong passwords, you want to integrate intrusion detection systems to the access points,\" said Alan Marshall, professor of communication networks at the University of Liverpool. He would not go into detail about the methods in order to prevent the attack being used on real victims but said a proof-of-concept attack had been developed at the university. 'Under control' The virus, dubbed Chameleon, seeks out wi-fi access points - devices that transmit the wi-fi signal, found in many homes - that have not had their admin password changed. This password is different from the one used to log on to the wi-fi network itself, and is often left unchanged from the default setting. Once an access point is under a hacker's control, new firmware can be installed. \"So it's now under our control,\" explained Prof Marshall. \"Once you do that you can then do other things with it. You can recover passwords, steal data - anything you want.\" Spreading out But it is the next step of the virus that is most unusual. Once installed on one access point, the virus can - without being controlled by a human - automatically seek out other vulnerable access points, taking them over as and when they are found. Prof Marshall told the BBC that this was unlikely to be a threat to big business wi-fi networks, which should have enhanced security in place. However, networks in homes, or at small premises like coffee shops, are typically found with less stringent protection measures in place. Now that his team has demonstrated the threat, Prof Marshall said attention would turn to creating a product that could be installed in wi-fi access points to prevent this kind of hijacking - without requiring the user to take responsibility.

Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing \"untold human suffering\" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a \"suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years\". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. \"An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,\" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. \"That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people.\" How does this differ from other reports on climate change? The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. These are: Energy: Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. Short-lived pollutants: These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature: Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food: A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy: Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population: The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. So who are the scientists who have endorsed the report? Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. \"We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a a problem,\" said Dr Newsome. What do the authors want to happen now? The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action. However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. \"We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. \"As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress.\" So what about human population growth? The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. \"It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,\" said Dr Newsome. \"It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.\" Follow Matt on Twitter.", "summary": "最新一项研究指出，全球正面临气候危机。超过11000名科学家认可这项研究。"}

This was exactly what the Sino-British deal of 1984 had in mind as it laid the groundwork for the territory's eventual handback to China in 1997. \"One Country, Two Systems\", as the formula is known, is meant to allow Hong Kong to continue until at least 2047 with its free speech, its independent courts and its vibrant - if limited - democracy, while the new sovereign power maintains its rigid, one-party rule. The spectacle of China's stage-managed National People's Congress imposing sweeping changes on Hong Kong's political system - by a true-to-form unanimous vote - is for many observers the moment that experiment goes up in smoke. As China frequently points out, Hong Kong's former colonial masters were slow to offer its citizens a democratic voice. There may well have been good reasons for the foot-dragging, not least the warnings as far back as the 1950s from China that any attempt to introduce self-governance would lead to invasion. Nonetheless, the Hong Kong handed to China - while democratically deficient in terms of universal suffrage - had other deeply ingrained freedoms that were part and parcel of its status as a free-wheeling capitalist economy and a free-trading port. \"Although we've never had democracy,\" former Democratic Party spokesperson Emily Lau tells me, \"the irony is the level of freedoms, personal safety and the rule of law that we have enjoyed for decades is much higher than in some places that have periodic elections.\" Those traditions are in stark contrast to the system of governance practised by its political masters in Beijing, and that tension has been at the heart of the tussle over what the \"two systems\" part of the bargain means ever since. The turning point China argues that it has tried to uphold the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that was meant to embody the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. It has even attempted in good faith, it says, to enact Article 45 which calls for the introduction of universal suffrage for the election of the city's leader, the chief executive. The plan was scuppered by the 2014 \"Umbrella Movement\" driven by anger over the mechanism for choosing the candidates in which Beijing would continue to wield a veto. The attempts to enact a National Security Law, again stipulated by the Basic Law, has also led to protests. In the end, the sticking point has been less a question of the technicalities of the proposed changes - and more a question of profound distrust. Most countries have national security legislation, all democratic systems are imperfect in some way, but few have these institutions overseen by a rising, authoritarian superpower. And the tragedy for Hong Kong's beleaguered pro-democracy movement is that each time it has tried to push back against Beijing, it has found itself worse off than before. The tipping point came with the massive, sometimes violent, protests in 2019 over plans to introduce an extradition bill, potentially allowing Hong Kong suspects to be sent for trial in China. The disorder gave Beijing the pretext it needed to finally push through the National Security Law, which had an overnight, chilling effect on the ability to protest. The law sets out vague, sweeping offences of \"secession\", \"subversion\", and \"collusion\" with foreign forces, and with the possibility of extradition a central feature. Serious cases can be transferred to the mainland for trial with far less oversight than would have been the case under the rejected extradition bill. A series of dawn raids in January saw 55 politicians and activists arrested, with 47 now charged. Simply holding up protest banners or the wearing of T-shirts are potentially enough to get someone detained. The effort by Hong Kong democrats ahead of last year's elections to hold unofficial primaries - as a tactical way to increase their chance of winning a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo) - looked like it might almost have succeeded. They had, after all, swept the board at the 2019 local elections - the city's only genuinely democratic poll - a result that confirmed the depth of the support for their cause and one that will have seriously spooked Beijing. But the LegCo primaries plan backfired too - the election was cancelled - ostensibly for reasons of pandemic control - and Beijing brought in the reforms now rubber stamped by the National People's Congress, and under which the chances of pro-democrats winning a majority have gone for good. Emily Lau is in no doubt about the significance of the new requirement that all candidates will be vetted, by a committee stuffed with Beijing loyalists, to make sure they're \"patriots\". \"If they are going to impose a system on Hong Kong whereby the voters would in effect be disenfranchised and whereby my party or other pro-democracy people will not be free to take part in elections independently and freely, then One Country, Two Systems is over,\" she says. Democracy gives way Even Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians appear to suggest that something fundamental has changed. Regina Ip is the founder of the New People's Party, with a seat in LegCo and a member of the governing Executive Council. While she insists that One Country, Two Systems isn't over, she seems less certain about whether it any longer aims to accommodate democracy. \"I think Beijing may be exploring a movement toward alternative systems, such as what some Western thinkers advocate - epistocracy - the rule by more knowledgeable, high information people,\" she tells me. I put it to her that such a system sounds very undemocratic. \"A democratic system has no intrinsic value unless it can deliver good outcomes,\" she replies. \"We have had 23 years of experiments with democracy, the outcomes are far from satisfactory. We are underperforming in many ways.\" Chinese state media also appears to be moving the goalposts, arguing that One Country, Two Systems has always referred not to political differences, but rather to the need to preserve two different economic systems. The British signatories to the handover agreement may once have hoped that the fundamental contradiction at the heart of it would be resolved as China modernised, enacted its own internal reforms, and moved politically closer towards Hong Kong. If so, it has proved wishful thinking, with China arguably more authoritarian than it was at the time the treaty was signed. \"As an inalienable part of China, we cannot afford to be a country that undermines the security of China,\" Regina Ip says. \"If they don't think the current system is sustainable, the option will be to reintegrate Hong Kong, even before 2047.\" It is Hong Kong that is changing and in the long tussle between those two, incompatible sets of values, it is democracy that is finally giving way. Emily Lau, the former Democratic Party chairperson, tells me she knows she is taking a risk, even speaking to the foreign media. \"Well of course there's a risk,\" she says, \"but I mean, frankly I don't think I have breached the National Security Law. \"But that's me saying so… and if they say, oh yes you have, well, that's it.

But unlike recent Chinese high-profile space missions, very few details have emerged about the vehicle and no visuals have been released. Mysterious vehicle Chinese authorities have been tight-lipped about the nature of the short-duration excursion and what technologies were tested. The exact launch and landing times were not revealed, nor was the landing site although it is thought to be the Taklamakan Desert, which is in northwest China. \"There are many firsts in this launch. The spacecraft is new, the launch method is also different. That's why we need to make sure there is extra security,\" a military source told South China Morning Post (SCMP). An official memo circulating on social media also warned staff and visitors to the launch site not to film the lift-off or discuss it online, according to SCMP. The launch of the vehicle may have come as a surprise - there was no official announcement prior to the launch - but China has been working on such technology for the past decade. Three years ago, China said it would launch a space vessel in 2020 that \"will fly into the sky like an aircraft\" and be reusable. A reusable spacecraft - as the name implies can undertake multiple trips to space - thereby potentially lowering the overall cost of launch activity. A traditional one-off spacecraft - costing tens of millions of dollars - is practically rendered useless after a single mission. The experimental vessel reached an altitude of about 350km, which is in line with China's previous crewed flights. The spacecraft also released an unknown object into the orbit before returning to Earth. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, says the aim of the mission was likely to test out the vehicle's systems such as power, temperature, stability and to prove it could re-enter and land correctly. Once the testing is complete, such a vehicle could be used to launch and repair satellites, survey the Earth, as well as take astronauts and goods to and from orbit, possibly to a planned future Chinese space station. Comparisons to US' X-37 space plane The Chinese craft's size and shape remain unclear but it is widely believed to be some sort of uncrewed space plane similar to the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle operated by the US Air Force. The recent mission could be linked to the Shenlong - or divine dragon - space plane project, which has been in development for some time, according to reports. A second Chinese reusable space plane called Tengyun, or cloud climber, is also in the works. If confirmed as a space plane, China would become only the third country to have successfully launched such a vehicle into orbit after the US and the former Soviet Union. The European Space Agency is working on its own reusable orbital vehicle called Space Rider, while India is also said to be developing a space shuttle-like craft. The X-37B, resembling a miniature space shuttle, has been in orbit since late May following its launch on its sixth assignment. Very little is known about the X-37B's missions, prompting speculation that the planes could be used for spying activity or testing space weapons. Similarly, the lack of publicity has given rise to speculation that the Chinese spacecraft could also possibly have some military use. \"The secrecy, I am sure, is just because it is a military project,\" adds McDowell, who has been closely following the mission. There is little distinction between China's civilian and military space programmes which fuels suspicions about Beijing's space ambitions. \"It is reasonable to assume that what's being tested has some military applications, probably new satellite equipment and spying technologies,\" notes Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy academic at the University of Leicester. \"We'll have to wait and see how many future flights like this China may conduct to see whether it will match the scale of X-37B,\" he told the BBC. China's state-run outlet Global Times, citing observers, did say that the country should have the capability to strike anywhere on Earth within half an hour, just as the X-37B does. China's growing space ambitions Whatever its purpose, the reusable system marks yet another milestone for China's ambitious space programme, and comes weeks after the launch of Tianwen-1, China's latest attempt to reach Mars. China has poured significant funding into its space efforts, and last year became the first country to send an uncrewed rover to the far side of the Moon. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the country's space endeavours and the Chinese state media regularly cast the \"space dream\" as one step in the path to \"national rejuvenation\". Earlier this year it also completed the network of satellites for its BeiDou navigation system, an alternative to the US GPS system. China is also working toward sending astronauts to the Moon and, eventually, Mars. \"If this really is a space plane, and not just a reusable capsule like Dragon, then it represents a big step forward in China's space technology as winged re-entry is really hard to do,\" notes McDowell. \"China was way behind in space but has been gearing up its space programme on all fronts and is now catching up fast. The spacecraft launch is just another reflection of that.\" Bleddyn Bowen adds the spacecraft launch is \"just another part of China becoming a comprehensive space power that utilises space technology for the purposes of war, development, and prestige like all others\".", "summary": "自从中国宣称秘密发射可重复使用试验航天器取得成功以来，专家们一直在思考其潜能和太空价值。"}

The Chinese heroes have to save the mission - and humanity - when Earth gets caught in Jupiter's gravitational pull. Based on Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin's short story of the same name, Wandering Earth has already grossed $600m (£464m) at the Chinese box office and was called China's \"giant leap into science fiction\" by the Financial Times. It's been bought by Netflix and will debut there on 30 April. But while this may be the first time many in the West have heard of \"kehuan\" - Chinese science fiction - Chinese cinema has a long sci-fi history, which has given support to scientific endeavour, offered escapism from harsh times and inspired generations of film-goers. So for Western audiences eager to plot the rise of the Chinese sci-fi movie, here are five films I think are worth renewed attention. Dislocation Huang Jianxin, 1986 For most in the Western world, their first encounter with Chinese cinema came from directors like Wu Tianming (The Old Well, The King of Masks) and Zhang Yimou (House of Flying Daggers, Raise the Red Lantern). They were largely preoccupied with themes like the loss of youth, tradition versus change, and creating the rural aesthetic most people associated with Chinese film. But China in the 1980s was a scene of rapid modernisation, urbanisation and Westernisation, and films started responding to the impact of this massive change. In Dislocation, a scientist creates an android version of himself to attend the endless meetings that rob him of his time, in a black comedy of mechanisation and bureaucracy. Huang's take on the debate on artificial intelligence is superbly delivered against a surreal Kafka-esque dreamscape, with stark lighting and suspenseful music, making this film a delight to watch. Hopefully the new interest in kehuan will see it gain an official release in the West. Warrior Revived Li Guomin, 1995 A grown-up style of kehuan emerged in the 1990s, reflecting the themes of identity versus technological advancement which were also occupying Western sci-fi at the time. In Warrior Revived, police officer Song Da Wei dies a gruesome death on duty and ends up in a decade-long coma. He's brought back to life by a \"miracle cure\" from a biologist who has found a way to repair defective DNA. The genetically enhanced Song finds himself uncomfortable with the cyberised world around him, and excluded by his old comrades. Meanwhile, the heavily maimed villain he gave his life to destroy is plotting to steal the gene formula and wreak his revenge. Like a lot of great cyberpunk movies before the age of CGI, this early mainland kehuan impresses with its high kitsch, low-budget, imaginative approach. The villain's lair is filled with neon tubes, hand-crafted lab controls and walls covered with plastic bowls in the best traditions of the Tardis. What it lacks in sleekness it more than makes up with innovative costume designs and soundtrack, diligent camera work and the sheer energy from the cast. Wonder Boy Song Chong, 1988 The 1980s brought a slew of Hollywood sci-fi films made for children, but which appealed equally to adults - like Explorers, Flight of The Navigator, and D.A.R.Y.L. - and filmmakers in China were taking a similar route. Produced by the Children's Film Studios and hailed as the nation's first children's fantasy film, Wonder Boy tells the story of a child born with the ability to generate electricity. Bei Bei is bullied by neighbours and kept in isolation by parents who want to protect him, but is still a caring and mischievous little boy, who uses his powers to help others and have fun in equal measure. When Bei Bei is taken away to be experimented on - by a non-governmental, possibly foreign group - a handful of the close friends he has made come to his rescue. Well-loved for its humour and accessibility, Wonder Boy is remembered in China as a great classic, and still enjoyed by children today when it is repeated on both national television and streaming services. Reset Hong-Seung Yoon, 2017 Produced by Jackie Chan and winner of the 2017 Grand Remi for Best Feature and Best Actress, Reset is a time travel thriller, which addresses a Chinese preoccupation with personal roles in a culture that so totally promotes the good of society. Xia Tian (Yang Mi) is a senior researcher of wormhole technology and a single mother. When her young son is kidnapped, she is forced to hand over her research, but when the villain murders her child anyway she is forced to test her own discoveries into time travel in order to save his life, and maybe undo her own betrayal of the programme. The film is an exploration of the plight of a New Chinese Woman, who walks the line between the roles of highly skilled professional and loving mother. The psychological exploration is fantastic. With several versions of Xia being generated by her repeated time travel, the face-off between our heroine and these alternate selves, including a darker, damaged one, creates an amazing tension which is missing from so many Western takes on this classic trope. A female-led space kehuan story that also deals with single parenthood couldn't be more relevant in a society that is simultaneously beginning a golden space age, and struggling with attitudes to women's emancipation. Super Mechs Cui Junjie, 2018 Wuxia, or kung fu fantasy, is so intrinsic to Chinese pop culture it was almost inevitable that its tropes would be incorporated into Chinese sci-fi. Produced exclusively for IQiyi, China's version of Netflix, Super Mechs is set in 2066 in a world where humanity has begun to experience genetic mutations which leave some people with X-Men style super powers. Global criminal organisations are threatening the order of society and private entities are stepping up to uphold it by developing highly advanced mechanised power suits. Hero Xiao Qi is an ordinary office clerk enlisted by the Dragon Clan, who reveal to him his latent mutant ice powers, before arming him with a robotic power suit and sending him on a mission. Little does Xiao Qi know that he will be greeted by another mech-suited warrior with fire-based powers who will fight him to a standstill. The \"warriors with opposite powers\" trope is a staple of the wuxia genre, but the film falls deeper down the rabbit hole when this deadly opponent is revealed to be Xiao Qi's long-lost brother. Add in ancient warring clans, fast-paced action between the sleek computer-generated mechanical fighters and a cheeky sense of humour from our protagonist, and the high budget Huayi Brothers production appeals to fans of superhero, kung fu and toku/tecuo films alike. The works of stalwart wuxia authors like Jin Yong are steadily being translated into English, so we will certainly see more from this sub-genre reach our screens. Acknowledging the rich and varied Chinese science fiction tradition does not at all detract from the pride in the success of Wandering Earth. With China's growing middle class and increased youth spending power, Chinese filmmakers are increasingly catering for a booming domestic demand for entertainment, and no longer worry as much about making their films palatable for export. But with more East-West co-productions in the pipeline, like the animated Next Gen which originated from a Chinese web comic, it is certainly a sensible decision for companies like Netflix to bring films from platforms like IQiyi, to an English speaking audience, and that is going to include kehuan. Western audiences may not immediately \"get\" some of these films, or may feel that some elements do not flow to their expectations. But Wandering Earth and the titles above are the product of China's culture and worldview. And to some extent, it's what makes them different that will pique interest, fascinate and entertain.

Mr Fogle is said to have worked as third political secretary at the US embassy in Moscow, which has issued no comment on the matter so far. Photos have emerged of his alleged detention. The agent was reportedly arrested with a large sum of money, technical devices and written instructions for the agent he had tried to recruit. While it is a sensitive time for US-Russian relations because of the crisis in Syria, the FSB's claims to have unearthed a CIA agent are unlikely to have any long-term political consequences, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow. Both countries recently said they wished to step up security co-operation after the Boston Marathon bombing. 'Dear friend' FSB photos purporting to show Mr Fogle during and after his detention appeared on Russian online media, such as these published by broadcaster RT.

The court said the move was technical and was not a reassessment of Hamas' classification as a terrorist group. It said a funding freeze on the group would continue for the time being. Hamas dominates Gaza and fought a 50-day war with Israel earlier this year. Under its charter, the movement is committed to Israel's destruction. Responding to the ruling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was a \"murderous terrorist organisation\" which should be put back on the list immediately. Israel, the United States and several other nations have designated Hamas a terrorist organisation due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence. Hamas, which was founded in 1987, won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in Gaza the following year after ousting its Fatah rivals. Its supporters see it as a legitimate resistance movement against Israel, with whom it has fought for years. 'Historical mistake' In December 2001, the Council of the European Union - representing the governments of member states - adopted a \"common position\" and a regulation to combat terrorism. It established a list of designated entities and people whose funds would be frozen. Hamas' military wing, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, was named on the initial list, and its political wing was added two years later. Hamas contested the decision and on Wednesday the EU's General Court found it had been \"based not on acts examined and confirmed in decisions of competent authorities but on factual imputations derived from the press and the internet\". The court said it was therefore annulling Hamas' designation but would temporarily keep existing measures against the group \"in order to ensure the effectiveness of any possible future freezing of funds\". This would be maintained for three months, or, if an appeal is brought before the European Court of Justice, until it was closed, it added. \"The court stresses that those annulments, on fundamental procedural grounds, do not imply any substantive assessment of the question of the classification of Hamas as a terrorist group within the meaning of the common position.\" Hamas deputy political leader Moussa Abu Marzouk said the decision was \"a correction of a historical mistake\". \"Hamas is a resistance movement and it has a natural right according to all international laws and standards to resist the occupation,\" he told the Reuters news agency. But European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said the EU continued to \"consider Hamas a terrorist organisation\" and would consider its response to the ruling. The Israeli economy minister called the court's decision immoral. \"Israel is strong and can defend itself against its enemies, but those who will suffer from strengthening terrorist groups will be the Europeans themselves,\" Naftali Bennett warned. Hours after the ruling, the European Parliament adopted a compromise resolution supporting \"in principle recognition of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution\", and calling for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to be \"advanced\". The original text had called for unconditional recognition, in line with resolutions passed by several national legislatures in recent months.", "summary": "欧盟普通法院宣布欧盟把哈巴勒斯坦伊斯兰组织马斯列入恐怖名单的决定无效。"}

The bill details, almost down to the last blade of grass, exactly what ministers would like to build. The bulk of the bill is dedicated to the impact the first phase of HS2 will have on the environment. This includes all those ancient woodlands and areas of scientific interest. Hundreds of copies are being distributed along the route, both as hard copies and as files on computers, so that people can go into their local library or to their parish council and see exactly what's planned. A special committee will be set up to hear from many of those who will be directly affected by the line. And, eventually, MPs will vote. The current plan is to get it all done before the next general election in 2015. Many assume the deadline will slip because of the sheer scale of the project. If MPs do pass the bill, it gives the government the power to start buying up houses and land regardless of whether the owner wants to sell. There's a long way to go before we will know for sure whether this controversial line will ever be built. Right now, Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls could hold the key. He has openly questioned whether it is worth £43bn, or £50bn including trains. For now, the project still has vital, cross-party support, but, if that wavers, HS2 could be dropped. Cost The government's most recent business case for the HS2 high-speed rail link slightly lowered the amount of benefit it predicts relative to the cost. The expected benefit-cost ratio has fallen to £2.30 from £2.50 in benefits for every pound spent. That fall is mainly due to a £10bn rise in the scheme's projected £42.6bn cost, which was added earlier this year. It also has revised an earlier assumption that business people do not get much work done on trains, a view that was widely criticised at the time. A study, prepared by Network Rail and the management consultancy Atkins for the government, said that without the project, there would have to be 2,770 weekend closures on the East Coast, West Coast and Midland main lines to increase the capacity to cope with demand in the future. This could lead to travel times between London and Leeds doubling.", "summary": "允许英国政府修建连接伦敦和伯明翰的高速铁路立法草案将提交议会。"}

Full-time childcare cost for a family with a two-year-old and a five-year-old child are estimated at £11,700 a year. The report compares the costs to the average annual UK mortgage payment, which was estimated at £7,207 in 2012. The trust says childcare in England, Wales and Scotland is becoming increasingly unaffordable with a 27% rise in costs since 2009, while wages have remained static. This is despite successive governments recognising its value to children, families, society and the economy and spending £6bn on supporting childcare every year, it adds. The report notes that during the course of the current Parliament, the government will have put an additional £1bn into supporting childcare. All children in England, Scotland and Wales qualify for part-time free early education in the term after their third birthday. In England, they receive 570 free hours every year, but even with this help some parents are contributing a substantial part of their income to childcare. In 2012, only Swiss parents contributed a higher share of their salary than British parents, who on average spent 26.6%. Rising nursery costs 25 hours/wk for child under two (�) The average costs for all OECD countries is 11.8% of parental net income. The report said that the current system was not working for anyone. \"Children are losing out on vital early education and families remain trapped in poverty because they cannot make work pay. \"Childcare providers struggle with debts. Women fail to return to the labour market after they have children and the economy loses their skills and their taxes.\" The study is based on information gathered by the trust from local authority family or children's information services in England, Wales and Scotland. Lynne Keeble gave up her job because she was paying for before and after-school care as well as a full-time childminder for her three children. She said she was forced to quit a job in London she loved because of the costs of childcare for her children, aged six, four and one. \"You can't go to work and then have nothing at the end of the month to show for it,\" she said. Anand Shukla, chief executive at the Family and Childcare Trust, called on the government to extend early free education to all two-year-olds. He said the government was currently funding childcare for some families with incomes of up to £300,000 a year. \"We would weight it differently to get some funding to lower income families\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But this measure is opposed by some. Stephen Davies, of the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: \"If you have taken the decision to have a child - which these days is a voluntary decision - why should you then expect other people, in the shape of the taxpayer, to help pick up some of the costs of that decision?\" 'Costs stabilising' Education and childcare minister Elizabeth Truss said the survey showed that costs in England had fallen for the first time in 12 years in line with her department's Early Years Parent Survey from earlier this year. The drop in England was about £15 over the past year. \"This means more parents are able to access affordable childcare and support their families\", she said. However, Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said cost reductions were due \"entirely to the efforts of early years providers\" and not because of government efforts. He said: \"For the government to attribute this positive trend to their own 'reforms' is completely disingenuous.\" Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for childcare and children, said childcare costs under the coalition government \"are soaring, adding pressure to family life and shutting parents out of work\". Scotland's minister for children and young people, Aileen Campbell, said while average costs were lower in Scotland than in England and Wales the issue \"remains a significant challenge for many parents\". \"That's why we're acting now, delivering increased and more flexible early learning and childcare of 600 hours a year for three and four-year-olds and the most vulnerable two-year-olds from August,\" the minister said. Liz Bayram, chief executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, added: \"To help more parents access affordable, high quality childcare, government needs to invest appropriately in childcare and recognise the economic benefit of supporting families to balance work and caring responsibilities.\"", "summary": "英国家庭和儿童基金会（Family and Childcare Trust's）的年度报告说，许多英国家长每年为照看孩子付出的钱，要比一年的房屋贷款还多。"}

Speaking at the Davos Agenda - a virtual version of the global summit - he said vaccine hoarding would \"keep the pandemic burning and... slow global economic recovery\", in addition to being a \"catastrophic moral failure\" that could further widen global inequality. What is the EU doing? The European Union is introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. The so-called transparency mechanism gives EU countries powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. \"The protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,\" the European Commission said. The controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt. However, the EU has been forced to backtrack on plans to impose restrictions on the export of vaccines across the border on the island of Ireland after outcry from Dublin and London. The EU insists its controls are a temporary scheme, not an export ban. Why is this happening now? The news comes with the EU in a very public dispute with drug-maker AstraZeneca over supplies, and under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution. Earlier on Friday the Commission made public a confidential contract with AstraZeneca, the UK-Swedish company behind the Oxford vaccine, to bolster its argument that the firm has been failing to fulfil its promises to deliver to the bloc. The contract stipulates that the pharmaceutical company would commit its \"best reasonable efforts\" to manufacture and distribute doses. AstraZeneca has blamed the delays on production glitches at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the late signing of contracts. Under the EU's new rule, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU. Its 27 member states will be able to vet those export applications. Vaccines produced by Pfizer in Belgium are currently being exported to the UK, and the EU insists that some of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in England is destined under contract for EU citizens. The EU is also in a supply dispute with Pfizer, which is set to fall short of the contracted vaccine volume for the EU by the end of March. Pfizer says the reason for that is the urgent expansion of its facility in Puurs, Belgium. Who is exempt from the export controls? The EU is allowing some 92 exemptions from the export control regime, including: vaccine donations to Covax, the global scheme to help poorer countries; and exports to Switzerland, countries in the western Balkans, Norway and North Africa. Other Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon and Israel are also exempt. But on Saturday WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the BBC vaccines should be given to all vulnerable groups and health workers across the globe before each country starts giving the jabs out more widely. This would mean wealthy nations, such as the UK, halting immunisations at home once priority groups had been vaccinated and instead helping with vaccinations elsewhere. \"We're asking all countries in those circumstances to do that - hang on, wait for those other groups. Rather than rushing to vaccinate one country, we need to be doing the lot and we need to be doing it together,\" she said. So far 95% of all vaccinations had taken place in just 10 countries, Ms Harris said, while only two low and middle income countries had even begun immunisation programmes. The EU is contracted to receive the following vaccine doses: Pressure grows as nations grow impatient The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says some EU governments are beginning to show impatience with Brussels, which had hoped its vaccination purchasing scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. The Commission's laboured negotiating process, the tardy approval of vaccines by the EU's medical regulator and delays now in vaccine deliveries have left EU citizens demanding answers and action, our correspondent says. Markus Söder, the Bavarian premier and Germany's possible future chancellor, told ZDF television on Friday that it was his impression that the commission \"ordered too late, and only bet on a few companies, they agreed on a price in a typically bureaucratic EU procedure and completely underestimated the fundamental importance of the situation.\" On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, describing it as \"quasi-ineffective\" for the over-65s. The claim was rejected by Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor who was part of the team behind the vaccine. \"I suspect this is a bit of demand management from Mr Macron,\" Sir John told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. Asked if he thought Mr Macron was trying to reduce demand for the jab, he added: \"Well, if he didn't have any vaccine the best thing you could do is reduce demand.\" The politics of vaccines in the EU Earlier this week the EU indicated this proposal was coming down the track. It would be a \"notification system\" officials said. Nothing more than a way of showing transparency. That has now turned into an export control policy, partly because of Germany's insistence that EU governments should be the ones to decide whether EU-based companies can export vaccines elsewhere. EU officials tell me that it's also been partly triggered by the deep suspicion of the \"vague justification\" given by AstraZeneca this week, when their chief executive insisted that the production problem was down to \"lower productivity\" at its Belgian plant. This new system of export control could well affect British vaccine deliveries. Pfizer currently dispatches doses from the Puurs site here to the UK. In future, Pfizer would have to fill in an export form and wait up to 48 hours for their export request to be accepted or rejected by the Belgian government. That decision would be based on whether the company could prove that taking that batch of vaccine to the UK would not affect the existing EU agreement.", "summary": "欧盟近日由于新冠疫苗出口限制问题争议，世界卫生组织（WHO）批评欧盟的做法可能会导致疫情延长的风险。"}

Wrap said buying too much, serving large portions and confusion over food labelling were the main causes. Its chief executive Dr Liz Goodwin called on stores, food manufacturers and government to tackle the situation. The foods most commonly thrown out were staples such as bread, milk and potatoes. Some 86 million chickens were said to be discarded every year. Wrap advised people to buy just what they need, serve smaller portions, and understand the difference between \"best before\" and \"use by\" dates. 'Terrific achievement ' The organisation, funded by the governments of the UK and the EU, said households had cut food waste by 21% over five years, saving consumers £13bn. But Dr Goodwin said this could be reduced by a further 1.7 million tonnes a year by 2025. She said: \"Consumers are seriously worried about the cost of food and how it has increased over recent years. Yet, as Wrap's research shows, we are still wasting millions of tonnes and billions of pounds. \"The UK is leading the way in tackling food waste and the 21% cut is a terrific achievement by millions of people who have taken action, saved money and helped safeguard our natural resources. \"However, there is so much more to go for and I believe we should be going for it.\" The government's resource management minister, Dan Rogerson, said \"there is still more to do\". \"Everyone has a role to play in reducing food waste and we want to see businesses helping consumers to waste less food,\" he said. 'Cosmetic reasons' \"Cutting waste and driving business innovation will help to build a stronger economy. We will continue to work closely with food retailers and manufacturers to achieve this goal.\" Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, rejected the suggestion that supermarket price promotions were to blame. He said: \"The organisation that published the figures did do research on the impact of promotions a couple of years ago and actually didn't find a direct link between promotions and food waste. \"The really important points are just simple things that have shown we can make a difference in our own homes - knowing the difference between a best before and a use by date, thinking about how we store the food and also using our freezers a bit more.\" Niki Charalampopoulou, from the campaign group Feeding the 5000, told the BBC there was also a huge problem with waste in the supply chain - often for purely cosmetic reasons. \"A farmer sometimes is forced to waste between 20% and 40% of the food they produce. \"And the problem is not only limited to UK suppliers - we have also worked in Kenya with a UN environment programme where we have seen Kenyan farmers waste up to 40 tonnes of food every week because it doesn't fit the standards of EU and UK.\"", "summary": "最新调查显示，英国家庭平均每周浪费相当于六顿饭的食物。"}

Referring to her own character in the film and Princess Aurora, played by Elle Fanning, Jolie said: \"We both very much need and love and learn from the men. \"And so I think that's also an important message for young girls, to find their own power, but to respect and learn from the men around them.\" She added: \"We have strong women, but the character that is wrong in the film and has to be taken out is also a woman. We show very diverse types of women between our characters, but also we have extraordinary men in the film, and I really want to press that point.\" Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the sequel to 2014's Maleficent, is released in the UK later this month and also stars Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michelle Pfeiffer. Fanning, who reprises her role of Princess Aurora in the film, echoed Jolie's comments and said her character's strength is not necessarily physical, unlike many princesses in children's films. \"Aurora's strength is her kindness, and she stays very true to herself, which is something I wanted to keep in the film. She is soft and feminine and wants to be a wife and have babies, and that's a beautiful, strong thing that isn't portrayed a lot on screen. \"A lot of the princesses are like 'we're gonna make her a strong princess! And make her tough, so we're gonna make her fight!' And it's like, is that what being a strong woman means? Like, we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it's beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities.\" 'How to use that power' Many of the female leads in action or children's films focus on the character's physical strength. Wonder Woman, for example, or Merida in the Disney's 2012 film Brave. Indeed, one of Jolie's previous roles was playing action hero Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. Explaining the premise of the Maleficent sequel, Fanning said: \"Five years have passed in her life, and she's now Queen of the Moors, and she has this new responsibility, and she's trying to figure out who she is as a ruler and how to use that power.\" The movie's plot sees Jolie's Maleficent conflicted over her maternal feelings towards Aurora, and facing competition from the neighbouring Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Queen Ingrith causes a rift between Maleficent and Aurora, when her son Prince Phillip proposes to the princess. Ingrith intends to use the marriage to divide humans and fairies, and it falls to Maleficent to stop the impending war. Official reviews are still under embargo, but critics who attended early screenings of the film have been allowed to share their first impressions on Twitter. \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is like Pirates of the Caribbean; there's lots of convolution and contrivance, but has star power,\" said Courtney Howard, who reviews films for Variety and Awards Circuit. \"Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning are a holy trinity with bumpy arcs.\" Scott Menzel, the editor of We Live Entertainment, described it as \"a visually spectacular sequel that proves once again that Angelina Jolie was born to play the title character. [It's] a modern day fairytale where badass women take centre stage. The battle sequences are epic and the costumes are stunning.\" \"Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer having a sass-off in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is every bit as good as you'd hope,\" said Digital Spy. \"The movie needs more of it, but it's still a visually bold, fun and superior sequel.\" The film received its London premiere on Wednesday. Fanning said: \"I definitely felt a real responsibility to do the second film, the first film was the first film I'd ever done of that scale, and so many young kids saw the film, and especially young girls would come up to me, and they'd look at me as the character. \"So hearing that we'd be doing the sequel, I felt a responsibility to those girls for sure, and just to get to show Aurora as a young woman growing up. Obviously in the first film, I was 14 when I did that, and Aurora still has the qualities that she does of kindness, innocence and sweetness that she embodies, but it was so fun to come back. \"The three of us [Fanning, Jolie and Pfeiffer], we were there in the beginning, our relationships have changed and grown, I'm 21 now, so I wasn't the kid on set anymore. I really felt accepted on set in a way. Especially with Michelle and Angelina, I felt like they included me as if I was one of their peers.\" Jolie says the films have come to reflect the life cycle of a woman - something that wasn't necessarily the intention when the first movie was conceived. \"One of the interesting things is, without realising, we've hit the chapters of the growth of a woman,\" she said. \"Her birth, her christening, to being a little girl, a teenage girl, to now being a wife. And so in a way the chapters are following a few things, but one of them is how a woman grows and evolves.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

They have identified a chemical in the brain's \"memory\" region that allows us to suppress unwanted thoughts. The discovery may help explain why some people can't shift persistent intrusive thoughts - a common symptom of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and schizophrenia. Researchers say controlling our thoughts is \"fundamental to wellbeing\". Associated words Prof Michael Anderson, from the University of Cambridge, who conducted the study, said: \"When this capacity breaks down, it causes some of the most debilitating symptoms of psychiatric diseases - intrusive memories, images, hallucinations, ruminations, and pathological and persistent worries.\" Participants were asked to learn to associate a series of words with a paired, but otherwise unconnected, word - for example ordeal/roach and moss/north. After this, they had to respond to either a red or green signal. If it was green, they were expected to recall the associated word but if it was red, they were asked to stop themselves from doing so. Their brains were monitored using both functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), which detects changes in blood flow, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures chemical changes in the brain. Researchers found a particular chemical, or neurotransmitter, known as Gaba, held the key. Gaba is the brain's main \"inhibitory\" neurotransmitter. That means, when it's released by one nerve cell it suppresses the activities of other cells to which it is connected. They found people who had the highest concentrations of Gaba in their brain's hippocampus (or memory hub) were best at blocking unwanted thoughts or memories. \"What's exciting about this is that now we're getting very specific,\" said Prof Anderson. \"Before, we could only say 'this part of the brain acts on that part', but now we can say which neurotransmitters are likely to be important.\" New approaches to treatment The discovery might shed light on a number of conditions, from schizophrenia to PTSD, in which sufferers have a pathological inability to control thoughts - such as excessive worrying or rumination. Prof Anderson believes the findings could offer a new approach to treating these disorders. \"Most of the focus has been on improving functioning of the prefrontal cortex,\" he said. \"Our study suggests that if you could improve Gaba activity within the hippocampus, this may help people to stop unwanted and intrusive thoughts.\"", "summary": "你有没有碰到过这种情况：明明应该尽快做完某件事情，但你却不停地推迟？"}

Although it's not illegal to eat dog meat in China, opinion is divided on how deep the \"tradition\" really runs. On Chinese social media in recent years, the Yulin Festival has become a focus for the large numbers of animal lovers - mostly within China - who are against it. But this year, the reaction has gone global. Since May, almost a quarter of a million tweets have been posted using the hashtag #StopYulin2015, with most of the activity coming from the UK, the US and Australia. One of the loudest voices has been the US animal welfare group Duo Duo, whose change.org petition calling for the cancellation of the event has received more than 200,000 signatures. The group's campaign video on YouTube has been viewed more than 130,000 times. \"I went to a slaughter house in Yulin a few days ago. The dogs and cats were wearing collars and of different sizes and breeds. They were very friendly,\" says Duo Duo founder Andrea Gung. \"Dogs are man's best friend. To kill more than 10,000 of them in one day is wrong,\" she says. Activists have also raised health concerns - although the meat is traditionally seen as having health benefits, campaigners claim the dogs transported into Yulin come from the black market and could be diseased. \"The consumer thinks they're safe to eat but they're not,\" says Gung. Duo Duo has intentionally targeted a Western audience with its social media campaign, rather than campaigning within China, as it says it doesn't want to interfere with the activities of local activists. \"The main thing we have done is made people in Yulin realise that their tradition is something from the past, that is perceived negatively from the outside world,\" says Gung. The conversation about Yulin has been mostly negative on western social media, but the chatter has been more mixed on the Chinese network Weibo. A page dedicated to discussing \"Yulin Dog Day\" has generated almost 350,000 comments. Many Weibo users expressed concern at the idea of eating dogs and shared loving images of their pets. But others accused animal welfare activists of hypocrisy and said local values in Guangxi Province should be respected. So just how widespread is the eating of dog meat in China? \"Although meat eating has increased in China over the past 30 years as the country becomes more affluent, dog meat is really not widely available,\" says Sam Geall, executive editor of the China Dialogue environmental blog. \"In the 15 years that I have been travelling to China I have never once been offered dog meat.\" Some have even claimed that the Yulin Dog Festival and similar events are in fact designed to draw in international tourists. \"It's common that local tourist administrators will capitalise on elements of their past to attract revenue and tourism,\" Geall says. But with increasing numbers of middle-class Chinese owning pets, criticism of the practice within China is growing fast. \"The perception of dog-meat eating has changed because of social media,\" says Geall. \"Over the past five years there has been a growth in the number of domestic animal welfare groups using Chinese social media to campaign against the consumption of dog meat.\" Blog by Anne-Marie Tomchak Next story: Protesters target Facebook's 'real name' policy Follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.", "summary": "每一年，社交媒体上对中国玉林狗肉节的谴责与日俱长，然而今年这股“骂战”却在全世界流行了起来。人们的愤怒情绪会不会让吃狗肉在中国停止呢？"}

The BBC understands no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consulted before the statement and Buckingham Palace is \"disappointed\". Senior royals are understood to be \"hurt\" by the announcement. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. In their unexpected statement on Wednesday, also posted on their Instagram page, the couple said they made the decision \"after many months of reflection and internal discussions\". \"We intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.\" They said they plan to balance their time between the UK and North America while \"continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages\". \"This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.\" 'Major rift' BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the fact palace officials said they were \"disappointed\" is \"pretty strong\". \"I think it indicates a real strength of feeling in the palace tonight - maybe not so much about what has been done but about how it has been done - and the lack of consultation I think will sting. \"This is clearly a major rift between Harry and Meghan on one part, and the rest of the Royal Family on the other.\" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said discussions with the duke and duchess on their decision to step back were \"at an early stage\", adding: \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\" Over Christmas, the couple took a six-week break from royal duties to spend some time in Canada with their son, Archie, who was born in May. After returning to the UK on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they received was \"unbelievable\". During the visit, Meghan said it was an \"incredible time\" to enjoy the \"beauty of Canada\". \"To see Archie go 'ah' when you walk by, and just see how stunning it is - so it meant a lot to us.\" Former actress Meghan lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and she has several Canadian friends. Close up, it was painfully clear that there were great chunks of the job they simply could not stand. Both of them appeared to come alive with the crowds. But Harry hated the cameras and was visibly bored by the ceremonial. And though Meghan was often the consummate professional, at times her impatience with the everyday slog of the role sometimes broke through. She said she didn't want to become a voiceless figurehead; but when she raised her voice, she found criticism waiting for her. They both made their feelings known in the 2019 interview with ITV's Tom Bradby. But beyond the detail, what was so shocking was how unhappy they both seemed. The sun-drenched wedding of the year before seemed like a dream; here were two people visibly struggling with their lives and positions. There are far more questions than answers; what will their new role be? Where will they live, and who will pay for it? What relationship will they have with the rest of the Royal Family? And there's the institutional question. What does this mean for the Royal Family? It comes just a few months after Prince Andrew stepped back from his duties. Some might see this as the slimmed-down monarchy that the 21st century needs. But Harry and Meghan reached people that other royals didn't. They were part of the reinvention and refreshing of the institution. This was not the way anyone would have planned its future. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter suggested the decision showed Prince Harry's \"heart ruling his head\". He told the BBC the \"massive press onslaught\" when their son Archie was born may have played a part in the decision. And he compared the move to Edward VIII's abdication in 1936 in order to marry twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson. \"That is the only other precedent, but there's been nothing like this in modern times,\" Mr Arbiter said. Asked how being a \"part-time\" member of the Royal Family might work, Mr Arbiter said he did not know. \"If they're going to be based in the UK, it means they are going to be doing a lot of flying [with] a big carbon footprint,\" he said, adding that this may \"raise eyebrows\". He also questioned how the couple would become financially independent. \"I mean, Harry is not a poor man, but to settle yourself in two different continents, to raise a family, to continue to do your work - how's the work going to be funded? \"How is their security going to be funded? \"Because they're still going to have to have security - who's going to have to pay for this? Where's the security coming from? Is the Metropolitan Police going to be providing it and if so whether there's going to be any contribution in covering the security cost?\" Mr Arbiter also suggested questions would be raised over why £2.4m of taxpayer's money was spent on renovating the couple's home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, if they will now be living elsewhere for some of the year. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the couple have \"considerable savings\", including Harry's inheritance from Princess Diana's estate and the money Meghan earned as an actress. But, asked about whether they might get jobs, he added: \"There is a problem for members of the Royal Family - relatively senior ones, even if they say they're no longer senior - getting jobs, because they are seen to monetise their brand and you run into a whole host of questions about conflict of interest\". He added that we are now in \"wait and see mode\" as to whether this new model of being a royal can work - \"or if this is really a staging post for them to leave the Royal Family\". The Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Harry, Meghan, William and Kate and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was £21.6m last year. Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over £5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18. Royal author Penny Junor said she \"can't quite see how it's going to work\", adding: \"I don't think it's been properly thought through.\" \"I think it's extraordinary but also I think it's rather sad,\" she said. \"They may not feel they are particularly loved but actually they are very much loved.\" Harry is sixth in line to the throne - behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children. In an ITV documentary last year, Meghan admitted motherhood was a \"struggle\" due to intense interest from newspapers. Prince Harry also responded to reports of a rift between him and his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, by saying they were on \"different paths\". In October, the duchess began legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. And the duke also began legal action against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. Prince Harry also released a statement, saying: \"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\" The duke and duchess moved out of Kensington Palace, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live, in 2018 to set up their family home in Windsor. Then last summer, they split from the charity they shared with Prince William and Kate to set up their own charitable projects. The couple's announcement on Wednesday comes two months after the Duke of York withdrew from public life after a BBC interview about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in August.", "summary": "英国萨塞克斯公爵哈里王子与公爵夫人梅根宣布，他们将告别“高级”王室成员身份，通过自己工作获得经济独立。"}

Footage broadcast by a local TV station of the men being pulled half-naked out of the bathhouse by police outraged activists and rights groups. Egyptian law does not criminalise homosexual acts, but they remain taboo. Adults suspected of engaging in consensual homosexual conduct are frequently arrested on charges of debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. 'God rescued us' The defendants acquitted on Monday covered their faces with jumpers or hats as they were marched into the courtroom in Cairo for the verdict. Five of them - the owner of the bathhouse and four staff members - were tried for facilitating \"parties of debauchery, orgies among male homosexuals\" in exchange for money. The 21 others were charged with practising debauchery and \"indecent public acts\". Analysis: John McManus, social affairs reporter, BBC News It is not illegal to be homosexual or engage in homosexual acts in Egypt. But the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) says the charge of \"debauchery\" is often used to crack down on homosexual activity in the country. The charge is more often used in cases involving prostitution, but Egyptian legislation - specifically Law 10 of 1961, On the Combat of Prostitution - mentions \"prostitution\" and \"debauchery\" together. The Collins English Dictionary defines the world as \"an instance of extreme dissipation\"; other descriptions relate to \"sensual pleasures\". Homosexuality remains a social and religious taboo within Egypt. However, the country is not the only place where, while not illegal, it is punished or discouraged using other laws. When the judge announced that they were all innocent, there were shouts of joy from their families. \"They destroyed our lives. God rescued us,\" one of the defendants, who would not give his name, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. One of the defence lawyers, Tarik al-Awadi, said: \"The verdict is an accurate reflection of the law and we expected this outcome. \"However, the rights of the defendants will only be realised when [the authorities] put on trial the people who were involved in this, and who offended the honour of these people.\" Several of the men have said they plan to pursue legal action against the Egyptian TV presenter, Mona al-Iraqi, who claimed she triggered the raid on the bathhouse on 7 December by tipping off the police about what was happening there. Days later, she broadcast footage that she said revealed \"a den of mass perversion spreading Aids in Egypt\". Lawyers also said that at least one of the defendants was raped while in police custody, according to the Daily Telegraph's Louisa Loveluck.

O'Donnell has had at least one album enter the UK charts each year since 1988. In total, the Official Charts Company has registered that the singer has had 33 albums chart over the last 25 years and 19 singles. Speaking to the BBC from Branson, Missouri, in the United States where he is currently on tour, O'Donnell thanked his fans for helping him set this record. \"I am delighted my new album made it into the top ten album charts and it's a fantastic feeling to have achieved chart success in the albums charts for the last 25 years,\" he said. \"I am lucky to have a very loyal and dedicated fan base who I can't thank enough for all their love and support over the years.\" Loyal fans Martin Talbot, the managing director of the Official Charts Company, who monitor UK album and single sales said O'Donnell's record is impressive. \"Daniel O'Donnell's track record, in charting with a new album every year for the past 25 years, is a truly impressive feat,\" he said. \"With that kind of consistency and output, there are few artists who can match him.\" The Kincasslagh man first stepped onto a stage in 1982 with an electric guitar he could not play - all he wanted to do was sing.

In 2012 tuition fees were trebled to a maximum of £9,000 a year and paid through upfront subsidised loans. The government said the loans were not currently a pressure on the system. Money lost Graduates only repay when they earn more than £21,000 a year, and unpaid loans are cancelled after 30 years. The IFS report looks at the group of English, full-time undergraduates who started university in 2012 - the first year of the new fees system. It calculates 57p of every £1 the government loans to students will be recouped. On average, each student will be lent just over £40,000 in today's money, the IFS estimates. Public purse On top of that, the government is paying £24,500 per student per year in teaching grants to universities and maintenance grants to students. The IFS prediction that 43% of the money loaned will be lost is based on earnings rising in line with Office of Budget Responsibility (ORB) forecasts from December 2013. If they grow by the more optimistic path forecast by the OBR in March 2012, the cost to the public purse would be nine percentage points less. The figures also took into account what it cost the government to borrow the money it lent to students, the think tank said. Taxpayer contribution The IFS calculates taxpayer contributions to university tuition are now only 5% lower than they would have been under the pre-2012 system, when universities were given much bigger teaching grants from central government. A rise in tuition fees of £500 a year would increase the taxpayer contribution under the new system of loans to that of the old one, it says. And it estimates removing the cap on student numbers and adding an extra 60,000 students each year would cost the government an extra £1.7bn. Report author Wenchao Jin said: \"The public cost of the student loan system is highly uncertain. \"It depends on graduates' earnings and repayment behaviour many years into the future, which we - and the government - can only estimate. \"Our baseline estimates now suggest that the total government contribution per student has fallen slightly as a result of the government's reforms, but that even a small real increase in fees would wipe out these gains. \"Whether these reforms have reduced the taxpayer subsidy will remain unknown for many years to come.\" More funding A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said: \"As a result of our reforms, a greater proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university than ever before. \"We have protected those on lower incomes by increasing the repayment threshold to £21,000. \"Our universities are well funded for the long term and now receive around 25% more funding per student for teaching. \"These figures for repayments are estimates and based on a prediction of economic circumstances some 35 years in the future. \"They will continue to fluctuate and do not present an immediate pressure on the system.\" Liam Byrne, the shadow minister for universities, science and skills, said the new system \"could end up costing the taxpayer more than the one it replaced\". He added: \"The only thing we're guaranteed from this Tory-led government's university funding system is uncertainty.\"", "summary": "一项研究称，英国大学学费和贷款的公共代价有多高“非常不确定”，将取决于未来的毕业生能挣多少钱。"}

The BBC has been criticised for paying £2m more than contracts necessitated. The BBC Trust says the claims are bizarre and it denied MPs were misled. In a letter to MPs investigating the issue, Mr Thompson says statements by the trust's chairman were inaccurate, information was kept from the National Audit Office and the head of human resources misled MPs over her involvement. 'Bizarre' statement The 13,000-word document was prepared ahead of his appearance before the Public Accounts Committee on Monday, where he will be expected to answer allegations made in July that he had not been open with the trust about pay-offs to two senior executives. The document included a briefing note prepared for Lord Patten on defending the size of the payments. Another attachment challenged the BBC head of human resources Lucy Adams' claim that she did not know of an email explaining the pay-offs, and appeared to show that she helped to compose it. He also claims the trust did not reveal its full involvement with the pay-offs to the National Audit Office. Media commentator Steve Hewlett said the letter raises \"serious questions\". He said Lord Patten's position could be called into question \"if Mr Thompson's argument prevails\". Mr Hewlett added that if it appears that Mr Thompson, who is now chief executive of the New York Times \"where executive ethics are a top drawer issue, has misled the Trust, then it is going to be very difficult for him\". The BBC Trust said: \"We reject the suggestion that Lord Patten and Anthony Fry misled the PAC [Public Accounts Committee]. \"We completely disagree with Mark Thompson's analysis, much of which is unsubstantiated.\" It added that it was looking forward to putting its side of the case to the Public Accounts Committee next week. The hearing is a follow-up to that which took place in July and saw Lord Patten tell MPs he was \"shocked and dismayed\" by pay-offs totalling £25m to senior managers. He said that if Mr Thompson was called before MPs, he would be \"as interested as you are, why we didn't know\". Lord Patten said he had \"no concerns at all\" about the statements made by Mr Thompson and was \"looking forward\" to appearing before the PAC on Monday. Speaking outside his home on Friday, he said it was \"very curious\" that Mr Thompson should focus on the £949,000 payout to his deputy, Mark Byford, as that happened before he became chairman of BBC Trust.

Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. 'Role model' for millions The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\" Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city.

In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says \"two images of the United Kingdom\" faced each other in this election: The \"exemplary success story\" of Mr Khan's life and \"the billionaire's son\", Mr Goldsmith. \"In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility,\" she told the paper. \"It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side.\" Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.", "summary": "英国工党候选人萨迪克·汗（Sadiq Khan）当选国际大都市伦敦新市长。"}

The leaked document showed that Australian spy agencies named Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the first lady, the vice-president and other senior ministers as targets for telephone monitoring, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Guardian said. The alleged spying took place in 2009, under the previous government. Australia and Indonesia are key allies and trading partners. \"It is not possible that we can continue our co-operation when we are still uncertain that there is no spying towards us,\" Mr Yudhoyono said. He added he would also write to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek an official explanation over spying allegations. The decision came after Mr Yudhoyono met with top officials, including the recalled Indonesian ambassador to Australia, to discuss the country's relationship with one of its closest neighbours, reports say. \"We're not only reviewing our co-operation with Australia, we're actually already implementing the downgrading of our bilateral relations with Australia,\" Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa also said on Wednesday. He added that Australia \"must take concrete steps\" to \"repair the almost irreparable damage \". He added that the relationship between both countries was \"not business as usual\". Strained relations Mr Yudhoyono said on Tuesday that ties with Australia had been \"damaged\" over what he said was \"hurtful action\". Mr Abbot reiterated on Wednesday he regretted the embarrassment the media reports have caused. However, he has also previously said he does not believe Australia \"should be expected to apologise for reasonable intelligence-gathering operations\". The document based on a presentation from the Defence Signals Directorate - now known as the Australian Signals Directorate - showed that agencies attempted to listen to Mr Yudhoyono's calls at least once. They also tracked calls made to and from his mobile phone in August 2009. The row is the latest in a series of spying allegations that have strained relations between the two allies, whose relationship include co-operation on asylum-seekers and anti-terrorism, among issues.

Mr Chen was stopped by a guard, who took him aside. \"They asked to take a photo of me - like a portrait - there in the lobby,\" he said. \"And it was just me. The Caucasian colleague who was with me - he wasn't asked to do that,\" added Mr Chen, who is Chinese-Australian. Mr Chen felt \"awkward\" as they took the snap, but he didn't want to cause a scene. Later, he asked colleagues if they had ever had the same experience - no-one had. \"So it was just me, literally. It was clearly some sort of security procedure the guards were enforcing. They didn't offer any explanation.\" The department told the BBC its security protocols were \"agnostic of background or ethnicity\". Mr Chen suspects that was not true in his case. He is among many Chinese-Australians who feel they are facing increasing scrutiny and suspicion - solely based on their heritage - as Australia hardens its views towards China. Accusations of McCarthyism There are 1.2 million people who have Chinese ancestry in Australia - about 5% of the population. In October, three of them - all Australian citizens - gave evidence to a Senate inquiry on problems facing migrant communities. But 20 minutes in, each was abruptly asked to \"condemn\" the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). When they objected to the question and its relevance, government Senator Eric Abetz pressed them repeatedly, asking \"why not?\". Each made clear they didn't support the CCP, but noted that such demands hadn't been issued to other witnesses at the inquiry. \"This felt less like a public inquiry and more like a public witch-hunt,\" one of the three, university researcher Yun Jiang, tweeted later. Another, Osmond Chiu, likened his experience to those forced to \"prove their loyalty\" during the McCarthy trials in the 1950s - an infamous purge by the US government against a perceived Communist threat. \"Never did I imagine I would be placed in a similar situation,\" Mr Chiu, a political researcher, wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. He told the BBC: \"It was like he [Mr Abetz] was trying to bully us. You kind of think that instead of wanting to hear evidence, he just wanted a political scalp.\" Mr Abetz rejected calls by political opponents to apologise. Instead, he issued a statement headlined: \"Standing firm against ugly dictatorships is everyone's duty Mr Chiu.\" Why are there suspicions? China is Australia's dominant trading partner, a relationship which has hugely benefited both countries. But in recent years, China has increasingly been viewed by Australia as a security threat. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) - a spy agency - first warned in 2017 of an increase in China's alleged attempts to interfere in domestic affairs. That same year, a senator resigned over his connections with a Chinese political donor. In 2018, Australia passed laws aimed at curbing foreign interference. A few months later, citing security risks, it became the first Western nation to ban Chinese firm Huawei from building its 5G network. Australia has also been hit by a series of cyber attacks - often suspected to involve China - on federal parliament, political parties, universities and science agencies. Negative sentiment towards China has also grown with Beijing's arrests of Australian citizens and its actions in Hong Kong, where it has imposed a draconian and controversial new security law, and Xinjiang, where at least a million people are alleged to have been incarcerated in camps China describes as \"re-education\" centres. The animosity reached new levels at the end of November when a Chinese official posted a fake image of an Australian soldier murdering an Afghan child. More on Australia-China tensions: Also in November, a prominent Chinese-Australian museum board director became the first person to be charged under the foreign interference laws. But experts say the security dangers are complex and should not be solely focused on Chinese-Australians. \"The greater risks to Australian sovereignty and independent decision-making come not from Chinese-Australian communities, but from people involved in or influencing politics, business and research,\" said Michael Shoebridge, a security expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi). \"This is where Beijing is focusing attention to silence critics and cultivate advocates.\" But Ms Jiang and others fear that Australia - especially its media - often wrongly conflate the ordinary Chinese-Australian community with alleged nefarious interference by China. \"The focus should be on actions… instead of guilt by association,\" she told the Senate inquiry. 'Silenced' voices There are few places where this \"guilt by association\" is more keenly felt than in Australia's public service, where people work for the national interest, often on sensitive matters. Many Chinese-Australian bureaucrats say they have increasingly felt under suspicion. \"There are legitimate security concerns [about China],\" said one senior policy adviser of Chinese ethnicity, referring to examples such as the cyber attacks. \"But the way it has spilled over into a conversation about the Chinese diaspora and who deserves to be Australian and who is assessed and analysed [for further scrutiny] - it has become a really, really bad conversation.\" Younger or less established public servants say they feel pressure to prove their patriotism or are wary when giving policy advice, to avoid unfair scrutiny. \"If I was a Caucasian-Australian, I'd be a lot more comfortable coming out and saying something different,\" Mr Chen told the BBC. \"But if you're from a Chinese background, people would just see you as being compromised. That's the sort of culture that we've got at the moment.\" Several public servants who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity - fearing reprisals otherwise - say they have also been questioned by colleagues on past activities that might otherwise be considered an asset. Their examples included learning Chinese at Chinese government-run Confucius Institutes, participating in Chinese youth groups at university, and taking previous trips to China. They also suspect that security clearances across government are increasingly being delayed for Chinese-Australians, and argue that vetting processes aren't being consistently applied. \"A former colleague of mine joined the public service three years ago - he still hasn't been able to get the clearance,\" said the senior policy adviser, referring to one process that typically takes six months at most. Such delays, they argue, have stymied career progression and even prevented people from working for the Australian government. Two people told the BBC they were forced to give up assignments because they never received higher clearance to work on them. The Department of Defence did not respond to questions specifically about Chinese-Australians, but a spokesman said that security clearances depended on several factors including \"the ability to check the background of the clearance subject\". \"If an applicant has resided overseas, the evidence provided may need to be corroborated through overseas institutions,\" he added. Mr Shoebridge said the process typically took longer if the public servant had visited \"places where it's difficult to get access or reliable information from\" - citing China, Russia and North Korea as examples. He added that the government took extra caution with Australians who have family, friends or other connections in China - because they're seen at risk of being more vulnerable to coercion. \"Chinese state agencies do have a record of using such things to exploit and manipulate people,\" he said. But, he added, there were also risks in not employing people with experience living in China. As one bureaucrat told the BBC: \"Say you're working in the China policy team. Ideally, you'd want some people from Chinese background in there... but if all the people with in-country knowledge can't get security clearances, then you're left with people that don't have any kind of actual expertise.\" 'A test of Australia's values' Jason Yat-Sen Li, a Chinese-Australian community leader, doesn't diminish the risk that people can be targeted and co-opted by China. But he said much could depend on how deeply Chinese-Australians felt part of Australian society - or conversely, if they felt treated like they didn't belong. The conflict presented a \"real test of our values and of our confidence in our institutions\", he said. Asio has long warned against isolating the Chinese community - identifying it as the most helpful group for building national intelligence on China. Commentators say that the Australian government's silence over comments such as Senator Abetz's did not help. \"We need to make sure that the language used by parliamentarians drives cohesion in our community, and doesn't score own goals by advancing the aims of the Chinese government,\" said Mr Shoebridge. The underlying issue is trust, said Mr Li. Do Australians trust their Chinese-Australian friends, colleagues, neighbours? And do Chinese-Australians trust in their society, that they will be afforded the same equality and rule of law as everyone else? \"Because if we cannot trust 5% of our population, that is so contrary to liberal democratic values, and that is doing more damage to our democracy than any foreign government,\" said Mr Li. *Andrew Chen is a pseudonym.", "summary": "今年早些时候，澳大利亚政府的一名初级顾问安德鲁·陈*拜访了该国国防部，去参加一次会议。"}

On Wednesday before the sentence was handed down, prosecutor Col Mike Mulligan urged jurors to opt for a rare military death penalty. \"He will not now and he will never be a martyr,\" Col Mulligan said of Maj Hasan. \"He is a criminal. He is a cold-blooded murderer.\" \"This is not his gift to God. This is his debt to society. This is the cost of his murderous rampage.\" \"He will never be a martyr because he has nothing to give,\" Col Mulligan added. \"He will not be giving his life, we will be taking it.\" Maj Hasan, who represented himself, declined to speak on his own behalf, saying only: \"I have no closing statement.\" The 13-member jury had to reach unanimous agreement in order to sentence Maj Hasan to death, otherwise he would have faced life in prison. The US military has not executed a service member since 1961. There are five inmates on the US military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, all at various stages of the appeals process. Maj Hasan opened fire at a medical facility on the Fort Hood base where soldiers were being evaluated before deploying overseas. The jury heard he had prepared carefully for the attack, during which he fired 146 bullets. The shooting spree ended when he was shot by a civilian police officer. He was paralysed from the waist down and now uses a wheelchair.", "summary": "美国军事法庭宣判对前美军心理医师注射死刑，被告曾经在德克萨斯州的一个军事基地开枪打死了13名军人，打伤32人。"}

If the economy suffers after the UK's departure from the EU, the extra allowance will help Barclays cover costs such as rising bad debts. The bank's chief executive, Jes Staley, said 2018 had been a \"very significant\" year, with several issues resolved. Last year, it took charges of £2.2bn to cover legal issues and fines, including a large settlement with US regulators and, in the UK, compensation over PPI. Barclays confirmed that it will pay a dividend of 6.5p this year. The company's management is under pressure from US-based financier Edward Bramson to raise its performance. Mr Bramson owns a 5.5% stake and wants to take a seat on the board. In particular, he thinks Barclays should scale back its investment bank. Last year, the investment bank reported a 15% increase in profits to £2.6bn. In a statement accompanying the latest results, Mr Staley said his plans would be good for shareholders. He said the bank planned to return a greater proportion of its earnings to shareholders, including buying back shares in the company, a move which traditionally supports the share price. Brexit concerns Barclays is not the only bank to warn about the possible negative impact of Brexit on the economy. Last week, RBS chief Ross McEwan said the UK economy faced \"a heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations\". He told the BBC: \"Larger corporations are pausing on their investments. And this cannot be good for the economy long-term, because those large corporations then employ smaller businesses and individuals.\" At the end of last year, HSBC also raised its provision for economic uncertainty in the UK by £165m to £410m. Commenting on the provision made by Barclays, Laith Khalaf, from stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"As with all the UK banks, Brexit casts a shadow over valuations, despite improving fundamentals. \"Indeed Brexit uncertainty has prompted Barclays to put aside £150 million in case of deteriorating economic conditions in the UK. That could prove to be insufficient or over-cautious, depending on proceedings in Westminster and Brussels. Therein lies the puzzle of the UK banking sector which explains lowly share prices; like Schrödinger's cat, no-one's quite sure what state it's in.\"", "summary": "英国巴克莱银行（Barclays）宣布，去年盈利下降了3%，达到59亿英镑。"}

It will have its US release two weeks later, on 6 November. Mendes, who directed the recently-opened West End musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, said he was \"very much looking forward to taking up the reins again, and to working with Daniel Craig, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for a second time\". He added: \"I am very pleased that by giving me the time I need to honour all my theatre commitments, the producers have made it possible for me to direct Bond 24.\" Skyfall made $1.1bn (£700m) at the worldwide box office. It was also the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK, earning more than £94m from ticket sales in 40 days to beat the previous record holder Avatar, which made £94m in 11 months. Skyfall won two Oscars - singer Adele's theme song of the same name won best original song and there was an award for sound editing. It was also named the outstanding British film by Bafta. It was reported in May that Mendes had resumed talks with producers about directing the next Bond film, having previously ruled himself out due to other commitments. Mendes is due to follow Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by directing Shakespeare's King Lear at the National Theatre in January 2014.

He intentionally started a descent while the pilot was locked out. Mr Robin said there was \"absolute silence in the cockpit\" as the pilot fought to re-enter it. He said air traffic controllers made repeated attempts to contact the aircraft, but to no avail. Passengers could be heard screaming just before the crash, he added. Details are emerging of the German co-pilot's past - although his apparent motives for causing the crash remain a mystery. Live updates from the day What happened in the final half hour? Mr Lubitz, 27, had undergone intensive training and \"was 100% fit to fly without any caveats\", according to Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, the German carrier that owns Germanwings. Mr Spohr said Mr Lubitz's training had been interrupted for several months six years ago, but did not say why. The training was resumed after \"the suitability of the candidate was re-established\", he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that the co-pilot's apparent actions had given the tragedy a \"new, simply incomprehensible dimension\". Police have been searching the co-pilot's home in Montabaur, near Frankfurt, as well as a flat he kept in Duesseldorf. The Airbus 320 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf hit a mountain, killing all 144 passengers and six crew, after an eight-minute descent. Andreas Lubitz: Germanwings co-pilot under scrutiny Who was Andreas Lubitz? \"We hear the pilot ask the co-pilot to take control of the plane and we hear at the same time the sound of a seat moving backwards and the sound of a door closing,\" Mr Robin told reporters. He said the pilot, named in the German media as Patrick S, had probably gone to the toilet. \"At that moment, the co-pilot is controlling the plane by himself. While he is alone, the co-pilot presses the buttons of the flight monitoring system to put into action the descent of the aeroplane. Crash site close-ups \"He operated this button for a reason we don't know yet, but it appears that the reason was to destroy this plane.\" Meanwhile, online tracking service Flightradar24 said satellite data it had analysed found that someone had changed the plane's altitude from 38,000ft (11,582m) to 100ft - the minimum setting possible. \"Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 you can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000ft to 100ft and nine seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting,\" Flightradar24 chief Fredrik Lindahl was quoted as saying by Reuters. Mr Lubitz was alive until the final impact, Mr Robin said. The prosecutor added that \"the most plausible interpretation\" was that the co-pilot had deliberately barred the pilot from re-entering the cockpit. He added that the co-pilot was \"not known by us\" to have any links to extremism or terrorism. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent The focus now moves from the mechanics to the man flying the plane. An accident expert has told me the investigators will pore over the co-pilot's background and that of his family too. Did he owe money? Was there a grudge? They'll look at his religion, whether he was in trouble with the law, whether he had a stable love life. This kind of event is rare but it has happened before, although the reasons vary widely. After 9/11, they made cockpits impregnable. It keeps the terrorists out, but in the end it also allows someone to keep their colleagues out too. Airlines have to make a call. Which is the bigger threat - terrorism or suicide? Passengers were not aware of the impending crash \"until the very last moment\" when screams could be heard, Mr Robin said, adding that they died instantly. After Thursday's revelations, several airlines have pledged to change their rules to ensure at least two crew members are present in the cockpit at all times. Meanwhile, relatives and friends of the victims travelled to the Alpine region where the plane came down, near the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. The disclosure of the likely cause of the crash has provoked anger. \"One person can't have the right to end the lives of hundreds of people and families,\" Esteban Rodriguez, a Spanish factory worker who lost two friends aboard the aircraft, told the Associated Press news agency. The principal of a German high school that lost 16 pupils and two teachers in the crash said the latest news was \"much, much worse than we had thought\". The second \"black box\" - that records flight data - has still not been found.

Mr Hagel, 68, a Vietnam war veteran and former Republican senator, said it had been his life's \"greatest privilege\". Last month, it was reported that he was sharply critical of the US strategy against Islamic State and in relation to the Syria regime. He will stay on as secretary until his successor is confirmed. An unnamed official told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Hagel and Mr Obama both \"determined that it was time for new leadership in the Pentagon\" and had been discussing the move for weeks. Mr Obama said Mr Hagel had come to him to discuss the \"appropriate time to complete his service\". The US president said he was \"extraordinary lucky\" to have Mr Hagel by his side as defence secretary and praised him for forging a strong bond with US troops. Mr Hagel is the first enlisted combat veteran to serve in the role. In a brief statement, Mr Hagel said it had been the \"great privilege of my life to lead and most importantly to serve the men and women of the defence department\". Analysis, Jon Sopel, North America Editor Chuck Hagel is a friendly, no-nonsense defence secretary. He was also the one Republican in the White House national security set-up. But that may be of lesser importance than him being appointed to do one task in the Pentagon, only to find that the job description has changed fundamentally. He was the man appointed to bring the troops home and pare back the huge defence budget. But then Islamic State came along and all the calculations changed, and Mr Obama and his defence chief found themselves at odds. There was a lack of clear strategy, perhaps because Mr Obama and Mr Hagel didn't agree on what it should be. And after mid-term political defeats, the president needs a military win. So a change at the top will be an important symbol of that determination. Which of course leaves the question, did he jump or was he pushed? Probably a bit of both. Mr Hagel, who served as Republican senator for his home state of Nebraska for 12 years, became critical of US involvement in Iraq despite voting to authorise the war. He replaced Leon Panetta as defence secretary in Mr Obama's second term, taking on the task of winding down the Afghanistan war and making a military shift towards Asia. But the future of US military policy has changed amid air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria. \"The next couple of years will demand a different kind of focus,\" an unnamed White House official told the New York Times, which first broke the story. US media report there was increasing tension between Mr Hagel and the administration over decisions in Syria and working styles, citing Hagel confidantes and senior defence officials. Republican Senator John McCain said he knew the defence secretary \"was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision-making process\". Mr McCain said Mr Obama needed to realise \"current failures on national security more often lie with his administration's misguided policies\". Mr Obama did not name a replacement for Mr Hagel on Monday. Once named, the nominee would have to be confirmed by the Senate. Among those being considered as replacements for Mr Hagel is Michele Flournoy, the former Pentagon policy chief during Mr Obama's first term. If nominated and confirmed Ms Flournoy would be the first female US defence secretary.", "summary": "美国总统奥巴马周一宣布提名美国前共和党参议员查克·哈格尔（Chuck Hagel）为美国新国防部长。"}
