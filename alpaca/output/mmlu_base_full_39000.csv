This is because the equation for the number of point in a basketball game is p = (18 - 4) * 2, and since 18 is greater than 4, the equation evaluates to p = 22. However, since p is greater than the value of 22 in the second game, the equation can be rearranged to solve for p. The answer is p - 4 = 18, which simplifies to p = (8 - 14) * (18-4) = 10, and since p is a positive integer, the equation is solved in a positive manner."

Thus, no net force will be generated."
"###, Response:A. greatest than the fieldfound by B. The correct answer is A. greater than B. This is because A. has a larger test charge than B, which means that their field will be stronger than B's. This is measured by comparing the fields of the two parallel plated with the same mass, charge and acceleration. The difference is then measured with a test charge of 2q/m, which is the mass of the test charge in kg m/s. The mass of B's test charge is measured in N/m, so the difference is measured in Joules. Since A. has more mass than B, their field will produce a greater force, which means it will be greater than B'S field."

"###, Response:A.The probability of getting an extreme result from chance alone is 020. This is because the null hypothesis states that there is a 0% chance of getting a result as extreme as the result from chance. The P-value is then calculated by multiplying the probability of the null hypothesis (0.2) with the probability of getting the extreme result (0.08)."
"###, Response:D. The correct answer is C. Expected freqencies in each cellshould be at least5. This is because contingency tests are designed to assess the probability that an event will occur, and the higher the observed frequency, the greater the expected frequency.

"###, Response:A. The correct answer is D. There is Some advantage. Because 35 is greater than 15, the confidence intervals will be wider for 35 than for 15. This is because the 25 extra observations will contribute to the confidence interval in a positive way. The mean amount of the 35 samples will be slightly higher than the mean of the 15 samples, resulting in a slightly larger confidence interval."
"###, Response:D.The shape is approximatelynormal with a meanof 21 and a standarddeviation of 375."
"###, Response:A. Taking a two-sample test with a 20% significance level and a 50% confidence level would increase power. This is because the larger sample size would increase the probability of finding a significant difference between the two samples. The two-sampletest would also reduce the probability for a Type I (false positive) error. The larger sample size and higher confidence level would also increase the power and reduce the probability that a Type I or Type B (false negative) error is caused."

"###, Response:A. The correct answer is Batch Normalisation. It is true that after applying batch normalisation, the layer's activations follow a standard deviation from the mean of the data. This is because the bias parameter of the affine layers is changed in order to reduce the impact of large values. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the mean of all the layers in the network and dividing by the number of layers. This gives the average layer size and the average bias parameter. The standard weights are then updated after each layer normalization. The correctanswer is BatchNormalization."

The statute requires that the supplier must tender the goods in order to satisfy the order, and the amount of goods must be specified at the time of order. The suppliers' memo does not specify the quantity of socks ordered, and so the order is not fulfilled. The statue of fraud will be satisfied and the suppliers' actions will be deemed to be in accordance with a written agreement."

"###, Response:A.No, the placentrian likely survived the store' s motion to dismiss. The tremors and box that fell off the truck were caused by the worker pulling the wrong lever, and the placentarian was able to avoid the unloading zone. The store was aware of the potential danger, but it did not warn the placentrial of the potential harm that could come from entering the area. The store's actions were deemed to be negligent, and the pedestrial was able to survive the accident."

The company's argument that the decdents were trespecting the land and not causing any harm is not relevant since the owner had no such duty to protect the decdants from potential harm. The decdants' families may prevail on the tort claim despite any defenses the company may have."
"###, Response:A. If the pharmacoist is found liable in a tort action, his best defense is to argue that the customer brought the wrong medication, since the correct answer is Clinorel, not Clinitize. This is because the pharmocist did not exercise reasonable care in filling the customer'se prescription.

The bank may still pursue the loan, however, with a judgment for the amount of the loan, interest and costs. The consumer may still be liable for the loan, despite the bank's decision to foreclose. The bank's action is still governed by the terms of the mortage, and the consumer may still face a deficit in the loan amount. The correct response is D.No."

"###, Response:A. Affirmed. The prosecutor's argument that the defender was intoxicated was supported by the toxicological evidence, and the jury's verdict reflects that the defector was in fact intoxicated at the time of his trial.

The shop ownersubsequently brings a claim against the wholesale, alleging breach of contract, and thewholesale has counterclaimed against the distributors, alleging payment owed under the contract, which was not paid. The distributors and the whales are both incorporations in the samestate, with the same principal place ofbusiness, and the same type of goods. The shop owner's claim against thewholesales is based on the breach ofcontract, and the whole's countersuit against the distributers is based on payment owedunder the contract.

The city has demonstrated that the school fees are necessary to further an important government interest in providing educational benefits. The burden of proof falls on the city to demonstrate that the fees are not being used as a punitive measure against the aliens, but rather as a way to provide educational benefits.

The appellate judge is likely to uphold the neighbor' right to build and enjoy their property."

"###, Response:C. granted injunctive reief and awarded damages."
"###, Response:A. Admissible. The prosection can introduce evidence that demonstrates the man'S likelihood to commit the crime.

"###, Response:A.Yes, because the scientific research required the scientist to transport a substantial quantity of highly combustible petroleum products in his car, which led to the doctor'S injury. The scientific research and transportation of petroleum were both done without any safety measures, resulting in the overturn of the car, and the spilling of the petrolem derivatives. The doctor's ankle was fractured, and he was injured as a result. The scientific information was not enough to prevent the accident, and so the scientist is liable for the doctor'a injuries."

It also limits the type of materials that can be distributed, as organizations are only allowed to distribute materials that are related to the fair. This means that any organization that wants to distribute material must have prior approval from the fair organizers, and must also adhere to the limited materials policy. This statute is a violation of the First Amendment and is unconstitutional. It limits freedom of expression and is an unacceptable infringement on the rights of individuals."
"###, Response:A.The driver's statements are both admisable on the issue. The first statement is related to the driver''s operation of the vehicle, which is the cause of the accident, and the second statement is related the driver'a payment of the bills incurred by the accident.

"###, Response:D. Sustain the objections. The treatise is not within any recognizable exception and the professor didnot rely on it in making his conclusion. The prosecuring attorney must now attempt to read the entire treatize into evidence, which is not a wise decision as it is too lengthy and complex for the jury to understand. The jury will likely be able to draw their own conclusions from the evidence presented."
"###, Response:A.Yes, a company which performs construction work is likely to prevail in any breach of contact action against the client. This is because the construction company can show that it has substantially completed the contract. The papercompany will likely be unable to argue that the construction was not needed or that the specifications were not met, since the construction company had to adhere to local building codes and industry standards. The paper industry will likely be liable for the damages incurred by the construction company due to any breach in the contract."
"###, Response:D.The home owner states that they accept the contractor’s offer but theprice is to be higher than $97.000, which is not acceptable for the home owner. The contractors son may continue the business, but the home owner will have to pay more for the construction."

"###, Response:A.The statute will helps racial minorites living in thestate obtain gainfulemployment."
"###, Response:A.The factory may appeal as it involves a contaging question of law."
"###, Response:A. denied. The correct answer is B. granted. The statute requires the defendant to provide incrimination information that can lead to a criminal prose. This violates the defendant’s privilege againstself-incrimitation and is thus not in line with the public policy considerate."

"###, Response:C. Yes, the owner of the state-licured massage parlors sued thestate for canceling their licenses and permits without any prior notice or hearing. This violated the FifthAmendment's guarantee of due process, and thus the owner was entitled to relief. The city argued that it had acted in accordance with its stated policy, but this was not enough- the owner'S rights had to be respected even if it meant that the city had to pay the owner for the lost profits. The court of appeals will affirm the decision if it is not reversed on appeal."
"###, Response:A.Yes, because the jury was instructed to find intentional murder, even though the defendant argued that he lack intent. This was not a question of innocence, but rather a question of whether the accused had the intent to commit the crime he was accused of."
"###, Response:A.Yes, a business is liable for prior criminal activities in its parking lot. It is the responsibility of the store to ensure customer safety, and the lack of security personnel and lighting in the parkiing lot increases the risk of a robbery or assault occurring. The store will likely prevail in the lawsuit as it is in the best interest of customers to be protected from potential harm."

"###, Response:A. Admissible as circumstantial evidence to show the defendant was wearing a bright yellow ski mask and goggels during the robber."
"###, Response:A. No, the buyer will not be favored in this situation. The saker has the rightful title to the property and the buyer does not have a legal recourse against the seller. The bueller's down payment will not be returned and the seller can continue to convey good title to the buyer. The bucker will have to litigate the issue in court in order to get their down payment back. This is likely to be a difficult process and may not be successful. The sacker may also be able to file a lien against the buyer to get their lost profits back. This will also likely not be the buyer’s ideal solution. The buck may have to pay for the sacker’s legal fees and expenses out of pocket. In the end, it may not be worth the risk and cost to pursue this action. The buyers position may be considered the strongest in this scenario."

The shop keeper has a better credit rating than the corporation, so the corporation is unable to assign the lease to the nonproft organization. The nonprofit org has no credit rating with a well-known cr. It is not correct to assign the corporation's lease to it."

"##|A purchasing party sued forspecific performance after a seller called off the deal. The purchasing party argued that the orally agreed upon price of $80,010 should be honored. The saker argued that the offer was made to someone else for $126,001, and that the purchasing party should be deemed to have accepted that offer. Will the buyer likely prevail in this instance?"

It may be necessary to object to the admissability of the testimory on the basis that it is too prejudiced."
"###, Response:A.No, because the witness' testimony is not admissible. The burden ofproof is different in a civil case than in a criminal case and the parties are also not identical.

Furthermore, the sign is small and unobtrusive, and thus does not detract from the aesthetical appeal of the downtow. The owner's refusal to take down the sign until after the elections is a matter of political disagreement, not a violation of the law."

The tract had been owned by the same family since 1880 and had been passed down to their daughter, who had since inherited it.

Thus, there was no probable cause for the defendant to be charged with heroin possession. B. Dismissal of Heroin Possession Charge: The prosecutions had to present a case against the defendent at the preliary hearing, but they were unable to do so. The judge thus ruled that there were insufficient grounds for the prosecutions to proceed with the heroin charges. C. Double Jeopardy Rights: The defendant had argued that the double jeepardy clause of the US Constitution should be applied to him, as the same incident was used to support both charges of heroin possession and the double jeapardy clause was not violated.

This approach has been endorsed by the United Nations, who have stated that “the human factor must be taken into consideration in any analysis of security, in order that the security of individuals can be better understood and improved.”  This approach also enables the study of non-material security, such as the security of ideas and information.  It allows for the study and understanding of security in the widest sense, enabling the study of both material and non-material aspects of security.  This is particularly important in the contexts of conflict and terrorism, where the study of social constructivisms can be applied to understand the motivations and activities of individuals and groups involved in conflict or terrorist activities.  This has enabled a greater understanding of the human environment and the context in which security is constructed and contested.
